UNLABELLED: Enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause of acute myocarditis and possible consequence of dilated cardiomyopathy. Some publications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy. AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle. Amplification for Adenovirus Type 3, Human Herpes Virus Type 6 and Enterovirus genomes were performed by nested-Polymerase Chain Reaction. Finally the virus-positive samples were direct sequenced. RESULTS: In 2 patients Adenovirus Type 3 and in 1 patient both Adenovirus Type 3 and Human Herpes Virus Type 6 were detected. No enteroviruses were found in any heart tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In our study the adenovirus genome was found to be the most frequent virus genome in explanted heart tissues. The identified viral sequences proved previous viral infection, which could have played a role in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Detection of different viruses in the myocardium by molecular biological examinations might contribute to adequate treatment of these patients.
