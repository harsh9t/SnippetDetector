Lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) concentrations have been inversely associated with maternal glycemia (2), insulin resistance (3), and increased risk of GDM (4). However, further studies are needed to examine the relevant associations, given its topicality and potential for clinical impact. This is even more so the case given that the nonpregnant arena results of observational studies and trials of 25-OH-D in diabetes conflict, with eight trials showing no effect of 25-OH-D supplementation on glycemia or incident diabetes (5).

We used first-trimester blood samples from 90 women who subsequently developed GDM and 158 control subjects. GDM was defined by at least one abnormal plasma glucose value following the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with normal values of <6 and <7.8 mmol/L for the fasting and 2-h postprandial samples, respectively (World Health Organization criteria). Maternal first-trimester serum 25-OH-D3 and D2 were measured using an automated solid-phase extraction procedure with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (7). The lower limit of sensitivity was 4 nmol/L for 25-OH-D3 and 7.5 nmol/L for 25-OH-D2. Within- and between-assay precision was below 10%. Results are reported as total 25-OH-D (25-OH-D2 + 25-OH-D3). A comprehensive description of prospective recruitment and exclusion criteria and the lipid and metabolic parameters measured have previously been reported (6). Variables are summarized as mean (SD), median (quartiles), or n (%) per category; groups have been compared using t tests, Wilcoxon tests, or Fisher exact tests as appropriate and using logistic regression analyses adjusting for different variables. Linear regression analysis has been used to assess the association between log-transformed 25-OH-D and demographic and medical history variables. Associations of glucose, lipid, and blood pressure measures with log-transformed 25-OH-D have also been assessed with linear regression, with and without adjustment for potentially confounding demographic and medical history variables. All analyses have been carried out in R (version 2.11.0) (http://www.R-project.org). P values are not corrected for multiple testing and should be considered descriptive.

Using a very well-phenotyped cohort, we found that first-trimester maternal 25-OH-D levels, despite being associated with 2-h glucose levels (independently of age, obesity, smoking, and ethnicity, etc.), are not significantly associated with the development of GDM. A single study has demonstrated an independent association of 25-OH-D at 16 weeksβ€™ gestation with GDM as defined by American Diabetes Association criteria (4); however, 25-OH-D deficiency was much less prevalent and 25-OH-D levels were determined by immunoassay, a methodology subsequently dropped by the Centers for Disease Control in favor of LC-MS/MS as a result of the poor specificity of immunoassays compared with chromatographic methods (8). Whether these differences underlie the differences in findings is unclear. It is also unclear why 25-OH-D levels continue to correlate with 2-h OGTT levels despite lack of baseline difference in 25-OH-D levels in women who do and do not develop GDM. The potential for residual confounding must be borne in mind. However, given that our study was larger (90 incident cases vs. 57 in that of Zhang et al. [4]), used more robust LC-MS/MS, and was conducted about 4 weeks earlier in gestation, lack of difference in first-trimester 25-OH-D is of relevance and suggests a need to caution against recommending greater 25-OH-D supplementation in pregnancy, at least as a mechanism to lessen risk for GDM.
Although there was no evidence of a relation of 25-OH-D with GDM, the prevalence of 25-OH-D deficiency (~20%) within our inner-city multiethnic population was notable. In the early 1990s, 90% of white pregnant mothers in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children (ALSPAC) study had 25-OH-D concentrations <50 nmol/L during winter and spring; 28% were seriously deficient (<25 nmol/L), and virtually no one reached 75 nmol/L (considered optimal) (9), with similar estimates found in other comparable pregnancy cohorts (10,11). Since then, despite significant public health efforts to ensure that all pregnant women achieve 25-OH-D intakes of 10 ΞΌg/day (400 IU/day) (12), there appears to have been little positive impact on hypovitaminosis D prevalence. That noted, 25-OH-D levels do not appear to have worsened considerably, at least as judged by comparing the present data with the aforementioned ALSPAC findings. This observation suggests that factors other than 25-OH-D deficiency (i.e., rising obesity rates in pregnancy in particular) likely explain rising GDM rates. To resolve uncertainties about vitamin D and pregnancy outcomes, there is a need for well-conducted and adequately powered studies of vitamin D intake in pregnancy. Until such time, the current study goes against a major role for vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of GDM.
