The aim of the study is evaluating the associations of FokI vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and its relations with postpartum metabolic syndrome. In a cohort study, 303 women referred to outpatient clinic of Shariati Hospital. The VDR FokI genotypes were determined. All subjects were followed 6?12 weeks after delivery. The frequencies of Ff, FF, and ff genotypes were 30.4% (49), 63.4% (102), and 6.2% (10), respectively, in healthy pregnancies and 34.5% (49), 54.9% (78), and 10.6% (15), respectively, in GDM patients. The ff genotype was more common in GDM patients. Healthy individuals had higher frequency of F allele, suggesting that F allele may have a role in decreased incidence of GDM. Concerning the GDM risk factors, f allele had significant association with prepregnancy obesity and family history of diabetes. In postpartum follow-up, women who developed metabolic syndrome were significantly older with higher prepregnancy body mass index, had more family history of diabetes, and also their ff genotype was two fold more frequent. Our results indicate a meaningful association between FokI VDR genotypes and an increase risk of GDM in Iranian population as well as its effects on postpartum metabolic syndrome.
