Background
ccurate and reliable prediction of protein structure and function remains a challenge. f particular importance is the prediction of membrane proteins, as, unlike soluble and fibrous proteins, 
			membrane proteins remain poorly tractable targets for the principal experimental methods of structure determination: -ray crystallography and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance () spectroscopy. 
			[1] his problem is highlighted by the observation that 20% of most genomes encode membrane proteins [2], 
			yet the number of solved membrane protein structures is approximately 2% of the  rotein ata ank (). [3,4]
embrane proteins fall into two structural classes: ±-helical and ²-barrel. t present, the only known location for  ²-barrels is the outer membrane of ramnegative bacteria. [5] 
			lthough there is very strong evidence for their presence in mitochondrial and chloroplast membranes (e.g., the voltage-dependent anion channel (), the long-standing homologue candidate in the outer mitochondrial membrane). he  
			database classifies  ²-barrels into 6 structural superfamiles: mp. A-like, OmpT-like, OmpLA, porins, TolC and Leukocidin (Ξ± Haemolysin) [6]. Ξ²-barrels have been shown to have a 
			variety of functions, including the passive transport of ions and small hydrophilic molecules, the export of xenobiotics, import of siderophore-bound iron, and a role in bacterial pathogenicity. 
			[7β€“10] Despite these widely different functions, these proteins show a remarkable degree of structural similarity, which has led Schulz to 
			identify 8 rules summarising  Ξ²-barrel construction. [5] Of these, two are of particular importance when attempting to predict TM Ξ²-barrel topology: rule two states that both the N- and C-termini 
			are at the periplasmic end of the barrel, restricting the strand number to even values; and rule 4, that external Ξ²-strand connections are long loops (termed L1, L2, etc.), whereas the periplasmic strand connections are generally short (T1, T2, etc.).
Although the 8 rules defined by Schulz characterise Ξ²-barrel construction well, the prediction of barrel topology from sequence remains a difficult task owing to several complicating factors. First, identifying potential TM strands as stretches of sequence 
		where residues alternate between polar and non-polar grossly over-simplifies the problem, as this pattern is frequently broken by non-polar residues on the interior of the barrel. Second, the average length of Ξ²-strands is seldom more than half a dozen residues; 
		they are therefore much harder to distinguish than longer TM Ξ±-helices. [11] Finally, the most significant hindrance to Ξ²-barrel topology prediction is probably the lack of solved structures on which to train 
		predictive methods. [12]
This paper describes the construction of a predictor for a beta-barrel membrane protein topology, based on machine learning Bayesian Networks (BNs). BNs are considered especially suited to computational biology, as they provide a flexible and powerful framework 
		for statistical inference, and learn model parameters from data. [13]

Methodology
ata-set. A dataset of TM proteins of experimentally verified Ξ±-helical topology were required to train the method. The data-set was obtained from the TMPDB database (release 6.2) [12], in which topologies have been 
			determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR, gene fusion, substituted cysteine accessibility, N-linked glycosylation experiment and other biochemical methods. Non-redundant subsets of TMPDB were used, and hence sequence similarity between proteins was less than 30%. The 
			Ξ²-barrel data-set (TMPDB_Ξ²_non-redundant) consisted of 15 proteins.Beta-Barrel Transmembrane Protein Topology PredictorA static full Bayesian model was used as it best fulfils the requirements expected of the network. The main advantage of such a model, compared with its naΓ―ve counterpart, is that the output probability is not a product of probabilities from each descriptor, but a 
			model which associates one probability with each combination of descriptors. Thus, overall performance is typically better, but never worse, than that of the best individual descriptor.Descriptors of amino acid properties were used to characterise amino acids. Each descriptor was averaged, using a sliding-window, to produce a set of metadescriptors. Each meta-descriptor represents one node, the state of which influences, probabilistically, the 
			state of the output node. There are two main facets to the descriptor-based sliding-window methodology: the use of appropriate descriptors that will provide inferences about whether a residue is TM or not; and the use of a sliding window as a mechanism for taking into consideration 
			the surrounding environment of a residue.The descriptors used were the 434 amino acid property scales in the AAIndex database (release 6.0). [14] The scales provide a large range of amino acid properties, including: size, charge, hydrophobicity and more recondite 
propensities (such as membrane buried preference parameter). The initial step in the creation of the methods was the production of a temporary metatraining- set. For every residue in the training-set, the 434 sliding-window-averaged values (one for each scale) are calculated, and 
whether or not the residue is TM located is recorded. The BN is trained on this meta-data-set. The optimal shape of the sliding window was found to be trapezoid (data not shown), with 50% less weighting of the two residues at either end - this is because these residues are further from 
the residue being analysed, and hence have less influence. However, this may not account for possible tertiary conformations that may bring residues close together that are far apart in the sequence. For TM Ξ²-strands, a window size of 7 residues was used. The network was then trained on the slidingwindow 
values and residue location. During training, the network attempts to find which descriptor values best correlate with the residue occurring in a TM region.When presented with a test sequence, prediction initially follows the same process as training, with each residue assigned a sliding-window-averaged value for each descriptor. The network then moves through the sequence, and determines whether the values encountered are typical of a TM-located residue. As
prediction is made on an individual-residue basis, there is a requirement for post-network processing to translate the prediction from single residues to TM regions. This is done with reference to knowledge of TM-region tendencies observed in solved and/or well characterised structures. Accordingly, post-network processing
imposes the following rules upon possible TM regions: Ξ²-strands must have a minimum length of 6 and a maximum length of 25 residues. Short strand predictions are disregarded and long predictions are split at the central residue and the two residues either side of the split are designated non-transmembrane.
