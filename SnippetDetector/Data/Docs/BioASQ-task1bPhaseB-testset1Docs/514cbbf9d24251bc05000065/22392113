OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the neurological prognosis and development of vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). METHODS: Eighty-two adult patients with aSAH diagnoses were prospectively evaluated. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, cranial CT scans, digital subtraction angiography studies and daily neurological examinations were recorded. Serial serum CRP measurements were obtained daily between admission and the tenth day. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were used to assess the prognosis. RESULTS: Serum CRP levels were related to severity of aSAH. Patients with lower GCS scores and higher Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades presented statistically significant higher serum CRP levels. Patients with higher serum CRP levels had a less favorable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum CRP levels were strongly associated with worse clinical prognosis in this study.
