BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a severe disease with high case-fatality and morbidity rates. After SAH, the value of C-reactive protein (CRP)--an acute phase sensitive inflammatory marker--as a prognostic factor has been poorly studied, with conflicting results. In this prospective study, we tested whether increased CRP levels increase independently the risk for cerebral infarct and poor outcome. METHODS: Previous diseases as well as clinical, laboratory and radiological variables were recorded for 178 patients with SAH admitted within 48 h and with aneurysms occluded within 60 h after bleeding. Plasma CRP was measured, as well as computed tomography (CT) scans routinely obtained on admission, in the morning after aneurysm occlusion, and at discharge during second week after SAH. Factors predicting occurrence of cerebral infarct and poor outcome at 3 months after SAH were tested with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: CRP levels increased significantly (p < 0.001) between hospital admission (mean ± SD, 11.4 ± 21.3 mg/l) and the postoperative morning (27.0 ± 31.0 mg/l) and then decreased (p < 0.001) during the the second week (19.8 ± 25.0 mg/l). Admission (18.0 ± 35.7 vs 8.5 ± 8.4 mg/l) and postoperative (41.0 ± 40.2 vs 21.1 ± 24.1 mg/l) CRP levels were higher (p < 0.001) in those with a poor outcome than in those with a favourable outcome, but CRP values did not predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or cerebral infarction. CRP levels did not independently predict outcome, since these correlated with admission clinical grade and occurrence of intraventricular haemorrhage. Higher increase in CRP level between admission and postoperative morning, however, independently predicted poor outcome (p = 0.004). Part of this increased risk was likely due to an appearance of early postoperative cerebral infarction. CONCLUSIONS: CRP levels correlate with outcome but do not seem to predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or infarction after SAH.
