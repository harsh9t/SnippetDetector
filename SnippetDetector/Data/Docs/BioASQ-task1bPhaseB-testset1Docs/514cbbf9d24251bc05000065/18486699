BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between serum concentrations of the immunoglobulin-like superfamily, selectins, hsCRP, and the development of DIND in patients with aneurysmal SAH. METHODS: Serum ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, L-selectin, and hsCRP were measured in 33 patients with SAH who underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Serum samples were obtained during the early period (day 0) and the late period (day 7). RESULTS: The serum concentrations of ICAM-1 (P = .009), VCAM-1 (P = .0383) and hsCRP (P = .0014) during the early period were significantly higher in patients with SAH than in control patients. Further, serum hsCRP concentration during the late period was significantly higher in patients with SAH than in control patients (P = 0033). Finally, serum concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and hsCRP during the early (P = .0055, P = .0266, and P = .0266) and late (P = .0423, P = .0041, and P = .0004) period were significantly higher in patients with DIND than in patients without DIND. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and hsCRP during the early and late period following SAH correlate with DIND.
