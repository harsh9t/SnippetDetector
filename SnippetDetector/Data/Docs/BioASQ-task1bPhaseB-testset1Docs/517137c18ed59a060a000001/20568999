CHD1 is a subfamily member of the CHD family, which possesses a chromodomain, a helicase domain, and a DNA-binding domain. The CHD family regulates gene expression by contributing to ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. CHD1 exists in the transcriptionally active region and alters the chromatin structure. Little is known about the function of endogenous CHD1, however, and studies have been hindered by the lack of an antibody specific for CHD1 in mammals. In the present study, we established a monoclonal antibody specifically against CHD1 using the rat medial iliac lymph node method. Immunoblot analysis using our monoclonal antibody showed specific binding to CHD1, allowing us to identify the deduced full-length CHD1. In addition, cell immunostaining clearly revealed the nuclear localization of CHD1. This monoclonal antibody will be useful for further analysis of CHD1 function in mammals.
