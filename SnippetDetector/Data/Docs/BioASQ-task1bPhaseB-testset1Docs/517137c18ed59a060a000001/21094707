The CHARGE syndrome is a multiple congenital malformation syndrome that usually results from deletion or heterozygous loss of function mutations of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene at 8q12.1. Besides CHD7-related cases, some patients with CHARGE-like phenotype have been reported with chromosomal imbalances. We describe a patient with a pattern of malformations reminiscent of CHARGE syndrome: choanal atresia, facial dysmorphism (micrognathia, hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, and depressed, broad nasal bridge), cardiovascular malformations, cryptorchidism, and developmental delay. He had duplication 8q and deletion 4q derived from paternal translocation t(4;8)(q34;q22.1). CHD7 mutation or deletion was excluded. The present report to the best of our knowledge is the only one describing an unbalanced translocation t(4;8) and CHARGE-like phenotype.
