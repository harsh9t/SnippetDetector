Following critical hypoxia-ischemia during labor and delivery, there is a window of therapeutic opportunity during hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Meta-analysis of three randomized trials of prophylactic barbiturate therapy for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy showed no significant effect on death or disability. One randomized trial of allopurinol showed short-term benefits but was too small to test death or disability. No adequate trials of dexamethasone, calcium channel blockers, or magnesium sulphate have yet been completed, but pilot studies in infants have shown the cardiovascular risks of magnesium sulphate and calcium channel blockers. There is considerable evidence from animal studies that posthypoxic mild hypothermia reduces brain injury. One small randomized trial of mild hypothermia found no adverse effects but was too small to examine death or disability. One large randomized trial of selective head cooling has finished recruitment and a number of large trials of systemic mild hypothermia are ongoing. As time is critical with post-hypoxic interventions, the delay involved in obtaining informed parental consent for such trials might obscure a clinically important therapeutic effect.
