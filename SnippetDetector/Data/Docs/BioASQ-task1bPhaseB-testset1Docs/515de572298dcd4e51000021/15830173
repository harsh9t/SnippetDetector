The financial balance of the health care system has changed dramatically due to a longer life expectancy and improved treatment options in elderly patients. More than 80% of cardiovascular events are lifestyle related and potentially preventable. Lifestyle modification is therefore the causal approach to decrease cardiovascular events. Improvement of nutrition and activity habits and prevention of cigarette smoking should start in the kindergarten, school and later at the workplace. A co-operation between medical societies and government institutions is necessary to achieve a population wide modification of lifestyle habits to lower the incidence of cardiovascular events in the population. Individual risk stratification is the basis for pharmacological prevention of cardiovascular events. The concept of the polypill has to be tested in controlled randomised studies.
