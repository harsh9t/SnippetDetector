Alagille syndrome (AGS) is caused by mutations in the gene for the Notch signaling pathway ligand Jagged1 (JAG1), which are found in 94% of patients. To identify the cause of disease in patients without JAG1 mutations, we screened 11 JAG1 mutation-negative probands with AGS for alterations in the gene for the Notch2 receptor (NOTCH2). We found NOTCH2 mutations segregating in two families and identified five affected individuals. Renal manifestations, a minor feature in AGS, were present in all the affected individuals. This demonstrates that AGS is a heterogeneous disorder and implicates NOTCH2 mutations in human disease.
