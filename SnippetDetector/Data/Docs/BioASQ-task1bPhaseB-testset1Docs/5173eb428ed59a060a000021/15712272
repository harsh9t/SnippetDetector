Alagille syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with developmental abnormalities of the liver, heart, eyes, vertebrae, and face. Mutations in the JAG1 (Jagged 1) gene, coding a ligand in the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway, are responsible for AGS. Here we present sixteen different JAG1 gene mutations, among them twelve novel, not described previously. Seven frameshift: c. 172_178del7 (p.Ala58fs), c.509delT (p.Leu170fs), c.1197delG (p.Val399fs), c.1485_1486delCT (p.Pro495fs), c.1809_1810insTGGG (p.Lys604fs), c.2122_2125delCAGT (p.Gln708fs), c.2753delT (p.Ile918fs); five nonsense: c.383G>A (p.Trp128X), c.496C>T (p.Glu166X), c.841C>T (p.Gln281X), c.1207C>T (p.Gln403X), c.1603C>T (p.Gln535X); two splice site: c.388-1G>C, c.3048+1_3048+2insG and two missense mutations: c.359T>A (p.Ile120Asn), c.560G>A (p.Cys187Tyr) were found. Forty percent of the changes were identified in exons 2 and 4, the remaining mutations are distributed along the entire coding sequence of the gene. Seventy-five percent of the mutations lead to creation of premature termination codons. Family studies revealed that the specific mutations were inherited in 3 out of 11 investigated cases. No correlation between genotype and phenotype was observed.
