A study was undertaken to determine fertility status in a group of adult females who as children had been operated on for perforated appendicitis between 1957 to 1975. The 389 girls operated on for perforated appendicitis were reviewed. Their ages ranged from 10 months to 13 years at the time of appendicectomy. Of these girls, 276 were now 20 to 43 years old, and they were contacted by means of a mail questionnaire, and personal interview wherever necessary. It proved possible to contact 181 women; 102 of them were married and 79 were unmarried. Eight-four of the married women (82%) had one or more children. Nine unmarried women also had one or more children. Eighteen married women who have no children were studied in detail. Five women were on contraceptives, two desired pregnancy but had not conceived, and one patient was separated from her husband. Two patients had conceived and aborted, and two were married to infertile men. Of the remaining six patients who had been investigated for infertility, no demonstrable cause of infertility was found in three. Of the other three patients, one showed evidence of bilateral tubal occlusion secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, one has had a right ectopic pregnancy followed by two abortions, and the third patient was found to have a pituitary adenoma. Our data show that perforated appendicitis before puberty has little if any role in the aetiology of tubal infertility.
