Infertility caused by hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea may be complicated by pituitary adenoma. In a group of 36 women with amenorrhoea-hyperprolactinemia-syndrome were 15 infertility-patients. 10 of them had prolactin levels above 100 ng/ml. In 6 patients a prolactinoma was removed microsurgically. In every case further treatment was necessary to get normal cycles. 8 of these 10 infertility-patients became pregnant.
