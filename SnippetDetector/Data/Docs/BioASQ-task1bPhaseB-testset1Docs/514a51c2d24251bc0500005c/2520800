Two hyperprolactinemic infertile women, one with and one without a pituitary adenoma, who were resistant to bromocriptine treatment, were treated orally with Hachimijiogan, a Chinese herbal medicine. This treatment reduced the serum prolactin level, resulting in a normal ovulatory cycle and pregnancy, without side effects.
