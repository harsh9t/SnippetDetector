Results in 136 hyperprolactinaemic women who presented with infertility, amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and/or galactorrhoea are reported. There was radiographic evidence of pituitary microadenoma in 21 (15.4%) patients and 5 (3.7%) had macroadenoma. Four patients were taking antidepressants, 2 antihypertensive drugs and 7 had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 6 months to 5 years. The remaining patients had no obvious cause for elevated prolactin levels. Patients with pituitary adenoma had a significantly higher (p less than 0.001) baseline serum prolactin level (182 +/- 4.6 ng/ml) than those with no adenoma (59.2 +/- 4.2 ng/ml). All patients in the study were treated with bromocriptine (2.5-10 mg) to normalize serum prolactin or to achieve a pregnancy. The patients without an adenoma required a significantly smaller dose of bromocriptine (2.5-5.0 mg) (p less than 0.005) than those with an adenoma. Galactorrhoea disappeared in all 64 patients within 2-4 months of treatment, sixty-six (71%) of the 93 patients who desired pregnancy achieved it within 3 to 8 months of bromocriptine therapy; 32 of these patients received additional treatment with clomiphene and human chorionic gonadotrophins for induction of ovulation. In the remaining 70 patients menstruation became regular and ovulation was evident in 40% of them. There was no significant difference in the pregnancy rate between the patients with or without pituitary adenoma. Similarly, presence of galactorrhoea or a high level of prolactin did not influence the pregnancy rate. No complications were observed during pregnancy related to pituitary adenomas; 8 (12%) pregnancies ended in first trimester abortion. No lethal congenital fetal abnormalities were observed in the patients treated with bromocriptine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
