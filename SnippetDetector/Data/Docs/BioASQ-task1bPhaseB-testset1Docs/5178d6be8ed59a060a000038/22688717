RNA expression profiles produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology (RNA-seq) allow comprehensive investigation of transcribed sequences within a cell or tissue. RNA-seq is rapidly becoming more cost-effective for transcriptome profiling. However, its usage will expand dramatically if one starts with low amount of RNA and obtains transcript directionality during the analysis. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for the creation of a directional RNA-seq library from 100 ng of starting total RNA.
