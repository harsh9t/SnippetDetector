1 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in many cellular activities such as metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, angiogenesis and apoptosis (1). 1 contains three ys2is2-type zinc finger motifs and it is generally accepted that its mode of action is mediated mainly by binding to the decanucleotide consensus sequence 5β€²-(/)(/)(/)(/)-3β€² in double-stranded  (ds. DNA) (2). In 2004, a study using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and high-density oligonucleotide arrays, identified SP1 binding sites in human chromosomes 21 and 22 (3). SP1 binding sites were not only found within the 5β€² promoter regions of coding genes and CpG islands, but also within or 3β€² to well-characterized genes. One noteworthy observation was that only a minority of the binding sites contained the consensus binding motif for SP1 using the motif finder MDscan (4). The remaining sites lacked the exact consensus or closely related-sequence variants, raising the question of how SP1 might recognize these other genomic locations (3). While SP1 binding to non-consensus sites may be mediated by alternative mechanisms such as indirect interactions with the DNA via other proteins, or to sequences more distant from the consensus (5), this prompted us to consider the potential recognition by SP1 to other DNA secondary structures. As the SP1 binding site contains consecutive guanine repeats, this raises the possibility of G-quadruplex formation. G-quadruplexes adopt a defined four-stranded core secondary structure by stacking of several consecutive G-quartets. Structural and biophysical experiments have convincingly demonstrated that G-rich sequences, consisting of repeated blocks of guanines, can fold into stable G-quadruplex structures (6). There is growing evidence for the existence and functional consequence of G-quadruplex structure formation in vivo (7β€“10). In the absence of G-quadruplex stabilizing factors and in the presence of the complementary cytosine-rich strand, the G-quadruplex structure is in competition with its double-stranded counterpart and may therefore be energetically unfavourable. However, during important biological processes, such as transcription or replication, parts of the DNA strands may exist as single strands and in this state the existence of a G-quadruplex-folded structure is more likely (11,12). Additionally, these guanine-rich sequences are significantly enriched around transcription start sites compared to the genome-wide average suggesting a role in gene transcription regulation (13β€“15). A computational study in 2008 by Todd and Neidle (16) revealed a correlation between putative G-quadruplex sequences (PQS) in cis-upstream regions of the human genome to the SP1-binding consensus sequence. This study showed that many PQS occurring in the immediate upstream region of the transcription start site contain the SP1 consensus sequence. Previous work has also shown that artificially engineered zinc finger proteins bind G-quadruplexes with high affinity (17β€“19). One such engineered Cys2His2- zinc finger protein, named Gq1, showed high specificity binding in vitro to the intramolecular G-quadruplex formed by the human telomeric sequence 5β€²-(GGGTTA)5-3β€² (19). CNBP, a natural zinc-finger binding protein, has been shown to bind to the c-MYC G-quadruplex (20). More recently, zinc finger transcription factors have been associated with G-quadruplex motifs genome wide in different mammals (21). Collectively, these observations have prompted us to examine whether G-quadruplex structures are recognized by the SP1 transcription factor.
In this study, we have focused on a known SP1 binding site within the human c-KIT promoter. The c-KIT gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor and plays a critical role in normal cell growth and stem-cell proliferation and differentiation (22). It also plays a key role in the development of melanocytes, germ cells and hematopoietic cells and dysregulation is linked to the formation of various cancers (23). The regulation of c-KIT expression is complex and relatively little is known about the factors regulating its expression. The c-KIT gene has a minimal core-promoter region of 125β€‰bp proximal to the transcription start site, which is required for maximal activity of c-KIT transcription (23). This region is guanine-rich and lacks a TATA-box. It has been reported that two potential G-quadruplex forming sequences within this core-promoter region, named c-kit1 and c-kit2, with three stacking tetrads can be formed in vitro (Figure 1) (24,25). Extensive biophysical analyses using circular dichroism, thermal difference spectra and UV spectroscopy have described these structures in detail and have revealed all-parallel structures with melting points >60Β°C under physiological aqueous-buffer conditions. Furthermore, high-resolution NMR spectroscopic studies have provided detailed 3D structures of both G-quadruplexes, c-kit1 (26) and c-kit2 (27,28). C-kit1 and 2 flank a 30β€‰bp long region, which contains several GG-repeats, and previous reporter assays have identified a single SP1 binding site in the proximal promoter region 80β€“101β€‰bp upstream of the 5β€² transcription initiation site (23).

ample preparation. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. In general, DNA oligomer solutions were prepared in 50β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0β€“100β€‰mM KCl. Samples were heated to 95Β°C for 5β€‰min and annealed at a cooling rate of 0.2Β°C/s to room temperature.Purification of SP1Nuclear cell extract from HeLa cells was purchased from Cilbiotech, and purified as previously described (29), except 5β€²-biotinylated dsDNA with sequence 5β€²-TCG ATG GGC GGA GTT AGG GGC GGG ACT A-3β€² and its reverse complement was used for the affinity column. All procedures were performed at 4Β°C. Briefly, 50β€‰ml crude nuclear extract from 109 HeLa cells was applied to a WGA-agarose resin column (Sigma-Aldrich, 2β€‰ml) pre-equilibrated with a high salt buffer (50β€‰mM Tris, 0.42β€‰M KCl, 20% v/v glycerol, 10% sucrose, 5β€‰mM MgCl2, 0.1β€‰mM EDTA, 1β€‰mM PMSF, 1β€‰mM sodium metabisulfite, 2β€‰mM dithiothreitol). SP1 was eluted with buffer Z [25β€‰mM HEPES pH 7.5, 12.5β€‰mM MgCl2, 20% v/v glycerol, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.01β€‰mM Zn(OAc)2, 1β€‰mM dithiothreitol, 100β€‰mM KCl] containing 0.3β€‰M GlcNAc. The eluate from this purification step was re-applied to a biotinylated dsDNA affinity column. SP1 elution was achieved by washing with buffer Z containing 1β€‰M KCl. Subsequent dialysis against 2Γ— storage buffer [24β€‰mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100β€‰mM KCl, 12β€‰mM MgCl2, 0.01β€‰mM Zn(OAc)2] followed by addition of 50% v/v glycerol yielded 1β€‰ml SP1 at a concentration of 28β€‰nM.Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were conducted on a Bruker Avance 500β€‰MHz instrument equipped with a TCI cryo probe. Water suppression was achieved using excitation sculpting. The sample for NMR analysis was dissolved in 500β€‰ΞΌl of H2O/D2O (3:1) containing 100β€‰mM KCl, 20β€‰mM PBS (pH 7.4) to a concentration of 100β€‰ΞΌM and annealed as above. Variable temperature NMR spectra were recorded at 25Β°C, 37Β°C and 44Β°C. The sample was equilibrated at these temperatures for 20β€‰min prior to data acquisition.Circular dichroism spectroscopyCircular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using software supplied by the manufacturer. Samples measuring 20β€‰ΞΌM were prepared containing different concentrations of KCl and annealed as described above. The samples (200β€‰ΞΌl) were placed in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1β€‰cm. Measurements were made over a range of 220β€“320β€‰nm at 25Β°C. Each curve represents an average of three scans that has been baseline corrected (buffer only).Thermal denaturationβ€“renaturation spectra were recorded at 290β€‰nm over a temperature range of 15β€“90Β°C at a heating/cooling rate of 1Β°C/min. Melting temperature was estimated from the maximum of the first derivative plot.Thermal difference spectraThermal difference spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 using a 0.1β€‰cm path length. The samples (40β€‰ΞΌM) were prepared in 50β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100β€‰mM KCl. Oligonucleotides were annealed as described above. Absorbance was recorded over a range of 220β€“320β€‰nm.Computational analysesPublished microarray ChIP-on-chip data (30) for the genome-wide binding of SP1 were obtained from GEO [accession GSE16078, (31)]. ChIP-enriched regions were identified using the β€�Ringoβ€™ package in the R/bioconductor statistical environment (32,33) and analysed for the presence of the minimal SP1 consensus sequence β€�GGGCGGβ€™ and its reverse complement β€�CCGCCCβ€™. For enriched regions containing the SP1 consensus sequence, a region spanning 20β€‰bp upstream and 20β€‰bp downstream of the SP1 motif was analysed for potential quadruplex forming sequences with the Quadparser algorithm using the search parameters G2+N(1-7)G2+N(1-7)G2+N(1β€“7)G2+, where β€�Gβ€™ was a guanine and β€�Nβ€™ any nucleotides and 2+ stands for two Gs or more (34). ChIP-enriched regions either with or without the SP1 minimal consensus motif were analysed for PQS with Quadparser. To test statistical significance of the observed association between SP1-enriched regions and potential quadruplex formation, each of the enriched sequences were permuted to generate random sequences of the same length and base composition. The randomized sequences were analysed by Quadparser with the same parameters. This was repeated 10β€‰000 times and compared with the observed number of quadruplex-associated sequences to generate an empirical P-value.Fluorescence polarization spectroscopyFluorescence polarization (FP) measurements were carried out using a PHERAstar Plus microplate reader at room temperature (20Β°C) in a 384-well plate (corning, low volume, black flat bottom, polystyrene) and a final volume of 10β€‰ΞΌl. 3β€²-fluorescein-labelled oligonucleotides (2β€‰nM) 5β€²-GGC GAG GAG GGG CGT GGC CGG C-TTTTT-fluorescein-3β€² and the reverse complement 5β€²-GCC GGC CAC GCC CCT CCT CGC C-3β€² or the labelled guanine-rich strand alone, respectively (prior annealed in 50β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.4 containing 100β€‰mM KCl) were incubated with SP1 in buffer Z for 30β€‰min at room temperature. Measurements were carried out using excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 520β€‰nm, respectively. For each sample, xz parallel measurements with an integration time of 2β€‰s were averaged. When comparing dsDNA in the presence and in the absence of SP1, a Z'-factor of 0.86 could be obtained (35). Observed binding-data were fitted to a hyperbola curve using GraphPad Prism Software.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayAll binding reactions were carried out in buffer Z containing 25β€‰mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 12.5β€‰mM MgCl2, 1β€‰mM dithiothreitol, 20% v/v glycerol, 0.1% v/v nonidet P-40 and 0.1β€‰M KCl. A Highbind Streptaplate (Roche) was hydrated with 1β€‰Γ—β€‰PBS buffer for 30β€‰min and blocked with buffer Z containing 3% BSA prior reaction. Subsequently, 200β€‰ΞΌl of a 200β€‰nM solution of biotinylated DNA (5β€²-GGC GAG GAG GGG CGT GGC CGG CTTTTT-biotin-3β€²) were added per well and allowed to attach for 30β€‰min at 37Β°C with gentle shaking. Wells were then washed three times with buffer Z containing 3% BSA. SP1 protein was diluted in buffer Z containing 3% BSA and 50β€‰ΞΌl added in each well. After incubation for 1β€‰h at room temperature, plates were washed three times with buffer Z. For detection, 50β€‰ΞΌl of a rabbit polyclonal SP1 antibody (Millipore) at 1:500 dilution in buffer Z were added per well and incubated for 1β€‰h at room temperature. After washing three times with buffer Z, a HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Cell Signalling Technology) diluted 1:2000 in buffer Z with 3% BSA was added and incubated for 45β€‰min at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with buffer Z and peroxidase activity detected by adding 100β€‰ΞΌl of the BM blue POD substrate (Roche). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1β€‰M H2SO4. Absorbance at 450β€‰nm was measured using a PowerWave XS Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments).SP1 pull-down and western blottingStreptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega) were washed three times with 500β€‰Βµl of 0.5β€‰Γ—β€‰SSC buffer and three times with buffer Z containing 3% of BSA. 200β€‰Βµl of annealed biotinylated DNA samples (1β€‰ΒµM) were incubated with the beads for 30β€‰min at room temperature. Beads were then washed three times with 500β€‰Βµl of buffer Z containing 3% of BSA and blocked with the same buffer for 30β€‰min. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4Β°C. A total of 1β€‰Βµl (12.8β€‰Βµg total protein) of a HeLa nuclear-cell extract was incubated in buffer Z containing 3% of BSA in the presence of 0.4β€‰Βµg/Βµl salmon sperm DNA for 10β€‰min in a total volume of 500β€‰Βµl. The reaction mixture was then added to the beads and incubated for another 20β€‰min, followed by 6Γ— 200β€‰Βµl washing with buffer Z. The beads were resuspended in 20β€‰Βµl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 2β€‰min. A total of 18β€‰Βµl of the bound fraction were then separated on a 8β€“16% gradient Trisβ€“Glycine polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. SP1was identified by immunoblotting using the rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1:5000. A goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody labelled with IRDye 680β€‰nm (LI-COR) was used for detection with subsequent imaging performed on the OdysseyΒ® Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR).

he 1 binding site in the c- promoter can fold into a stable and anti-parallel -quadruplex. The SP1 binding site within the human c-KIT promoter is critical for the maximal transcriptional activity, and is flanked by two well-characterized G-quadruplex motifs, named c-kit1 and c-kit2 (25,36). On further examination of this region, we noted that a third potential G-quadruplex forming sequence was located within the SP1 binding site (named c-kit*,
Figure 1). This sequence consists of consecutive GG-repeats with the potential to fold into a non-canonical G-quadruplex structure with two stacked guanine tetrads rather than the three tetrads that have commonly featured in most genomic G-quadruplexes. While some G-quadruplex motif search algorithms have been based on a minimum of three G-tetrads (34,37), biophysical experiments have supported G-quadruplex formation with just two tetrads, as it is the case for the thrombin binding DNA aptamer 5β€²-GGT TGG TGT GGT TGG-3β€² (38) and more recently, a quadruplex motif within the promoter of human thymidine kinase 1 (39).Given the possibility of a potential two-tetrad G-quadruplex in the c-KIT promoter, we employed a range of biophysical in vitro techniques to examine the potential for c-kit* to form a G-quadruplex structure. CD spectra of the annealed oligomer showed a maximum positive signal at 291 and 249β€‰nm and a corresponding negative signal at 263β€‰nm in the presence of 100β€‰mM potassium chloride, but not in the presence of equivalent concentration of sodium or lithium chloride (Figure 2A). These band assignments are consistent with an anti-parallel topology (40), which is to our knowledge, the first example of a non-telomeric human DNA sequence that folds into an anti-parallel two tetrad quadruplex structure. G-quadruplex formation is dependent on the presence of physiological concentrations of potassium (41), and the c-kit* structure showed typical strong potassium dependency typical for a G-quadruplex structure (42) (Figure 2B).
Figure 2.(A) CD analysis showing the folding of the c-kit* oligonucleotide [(20β€‰ΞΌM, (5β€²-GGC GAG GAG GGG CGT GGC CGG C-3β€²)] in different salt conditions. No formation of the G-quadruplex could be observed in the presence of lithium chloride (red) and sodium chloride (green). When annealed in the presence of potassium chloride (blue), the spectra showed characteristic bands centred at 290 and 250β€‰nm indicative of the formation of an anti-parallel G-quadruplex. (B) CD analysis showing the dependency on KCl for G-quadruplex formation of the c-kit* oligonucleotide (20β€‰ΞΌM). Typical G-quadruplex structure formation is promoted by increasing concentration of KCl. 0β€‰mM KCl (red), 5β€‰mM KCl (green), 20β€‰mM KCl (light bue), 50β€‰mM KCl (dark blue) and 100β€‰mM KCl (yellow).Thermal difference spectral (TDS) analysis supports that c-kit* forms a G-quadruplex structure. TDS provides structural insights into nucleic acid structures, as each spectral shape is unique to particular structures (43). For c-kit*, the spectrum obtained by recording the UV absorbance in a temperature range above and below the melting point showed major positive bands centred at 246 and 275β€‰nm and a negative band centred at 296β€‰nm, a profile characteristic of a G-quadruplex motif (Figure 3A). In agreement with our CD spectra, no G-quadruplex profile can be observed in the presence of 100β€‰mM sodium chloride (Supplementary Figure S1). We also performed CD-melting experiments with repeated heating and cooling of the sample that resulted in the determination of a melting temperature of 55Β°C. The heating and cooling traces superimposed and the lack of hysteresis was indicative of reversible and intramolecular G-quadruplex formation with fast folding kinetics (Figure 3B). CD melting experiments with various oligomer concentrations (2, 10 and 40β€‰ΞΌM) resulted in superimposable melting curves indicating the formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex (see Supplementary Figure S2).
Figure 3.(A) The TDS spectrum of the c-kit* oligonucleotide (5β€²-GGC GAG GAG GGG CGT GGC CGG C-3β€²) was obtained from the subtraction of the 15Β°C spectrum from the 91Β°C spectrum. This indicates the formation of an anti-parallel G-quadruplex due to positive band centred at 246 and 275β€‰nm and a negative band at 296β€‰nm. (B) CD thermal denaturationβ€“renaturation studies show fast-folding kinetics with little hysteresis. The broken line represents recorded data while heating from 15Β°C to 91Β°C and the solid line while cooling form 91Β°C to 15Β°C (20β€‰ΞΌM DNA).One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy on c-kit* folded in potassium showed distinct signals for the exchangeable iminoprotons resonating between 11β€“12.5β€‰ppm characteristics of the formation of a G-quadruplex (44). Upon heating to 44Β°C, the imino signals sharpened up to afford eight clearly resolvable singlets. This is consistent with the formation of two stacked guanine tetrads with each guanine in a unique environment (Figure 4) and suggests a homogeneous folded structure. The slight downfield shift of the imino signals (β�Ό0.2β€‰ppm over a 19Β°C temperature range) at these temperatures might indicate an increase in the dynamics of the bases near the melting temperature (55Β°C). Beside the imino signals, another singlet was also observed around 13.5β€‰ppm, indicating a hydrogen bond, which we suggest, may be from a loop base.
Figure 4.The imino region of the 1H NMR spectra of the c-kit* sequence (5β€²-GGC GAG GAG GGG CGT GGC CGG C-3β€²) recorded at 25Β°C (bottom spectrum), 37Β°C (middle spectrum) and 44Β°C (top spectrum) showing eight defined peaks. Conditions: 100β€‰ΞΌM DNA, 100β€‰mM KCl and 20β€‰mM PBS (pH 7.4).SP1 displays high-affinity binding to a novel G-quadruplex in the c-KIT promoterAs the c-kit* G-quadruplex motif falls within the SP1 binding site in the c-KIT promoter, we next examined whether SP1, purified from HeLa cells (29) could bind to the corresponding G-quadruplex structure. We established FP and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) as independent methods to evaluate the binding of SP1 to the c-kit* quadruplex and the canonical double-stranded binding site (Supplementary Figure S3). For FP, a 3β€²-fluorescein labelled oligonucleotide spanning the SP1 site, either double stranded (ds c-kit*) or the respective guanine-rich strand alone (ss c-kit*) that was annealed to form a G-quadruplex, were incubated with SP1 protein for 30β€‰min at 20Β°C. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for the SP1β€“DNA interaction were determined by non-linear regression by fitting to a hyperbolic binding curve. We found that, for SP1 binding to ds c-kit* and ss c-kit*, the Kd-values were 6.3β€‰Β±β€‰1.7β€‰nM and 1.3β€‰Β±β€‰0.3β€‰nM, respectively (Figure 5). We then confirmed these observations by an ELISA approach. Biotinylated derivatives of ds c-kit* or ss c-kit* oligonucleotides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated microwells and SP1 protein added to the wells at different concentrations to evaluate binding (see Supplementary Figure S4). The Kd values determined by ELISA for the ds c-kit* and ss c-kit* G-quadruplex were 6.2β€‰Β±β€‰2.1 and 8.5β€‰Β±β€‰4.7β€‰nM, respectively, close to the values determined by FP. Our obtained data are in agreement with previously reported Kd values (low nanomolar range) (45). Furthermore, we performed single point ELISA experiments with other G-quadruplex forming sequences found in the promoter region from DNMT1 (mouse), c-KIT (human), and a repeat sequence from the Simian virus 40 (see Supplementary Figure S5), demonstrating that SP1 is generally recognizing G-quadruplex structures with high affinity.

To achieve this, we assessed the ability of SP1 protein in nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells to be captured by immobilized 3β€²-biotinylated c-kit* oligonucleotides. First, the pull down experiment was established with a positive control using ds c-kit* and a negative control where beads not coupled to any DNA were used (see Supplementary Figure S6). As seen in the Western blots shown in Figure 6A, SP1 was pulled out of the nuclear cell extract with both, the double-stranded sequence as well as the folded c-kit* oligonucleotide.
Figure 6.SP1 pull-down from Hela cell nuclear extracts by c-kit* G-quadruplex structures. Nuclear extracts were incubated with biotinylated oligonucleotides bound to streptavdin beads in buffer Z containing 100β€‰mM KCl and the resulting proteins analysed by western blotting using an SP1 antibody. The detected SP1 protein appears as a multimer around 115 and 95β€‰kDa, consistent with the known profile of SP1 in Hela cells (29). (A) SP1 is pulled down by the double-stranded consensus motif (ds c-kit*) and the ss c-kit* G-quadruplex. (B) Less SP1 is pulled down by a single stranded G-quadruplex mutation (GQ-mut.) but still binds to the SP1 double-stranded oligonucleotide with the same mutation (C) Conversely, more SP1 is pulled-down by a G-quadruplex structure (seq-mut ss) carrying a mutation known to disrupt SP1 binding to the double-strand SP1 motif (seq.-mut. ds). (D) DNA sequences of the immobilized oligomers (either single- or double-stranded).Next, we performed pull-down experiments using two mutated c-kit* oligonucleotide to assess whether a mutation that disrupts the G-quadruplex or the double-stranded SP1 binding site would prohibit SP1 protein binding. The first mutation (GQ-mut) does not alter the SP1 binding site in the duplex, but disrupts the G-quadruplex formation in the single-stranded DNA, as confirmed by measurement of the CD and TDS spectrum in the presence of 100β€‰mM KCl (see Supplementary Figure S8). Incubating this oligonucleotide with nuclear extracts only gave a faint SP1 band compared with dsDNA from the same sequence (Figure 6B, Supplementary Figure S7 for relative band-intensity quantification). The second mutation (seq-mut) is based on the observations of Letovsky and Dynan showing the importance of the central C within the Sp1 recognition site 5β€²-GGGGCGGGGC-3β€² for DNA binding. Mutation of this C to A, G or T resulted in reduced binding (45). Following this observation, in the c-kit* context, a central C-G mutation should reduce SP1 binding but would still allow G-quadruplex formation (see Supplementary Figure S8). Indeed, the amount of SP1 pulled-down with a mutated double-stranded oligonucleotide was reduced, while binding to the mutated single stranded c-kit* G-quadruplex was maintained (Figure 6C, Supplementary Figure S7 for band quantification). Overall, these results support interaction of SP1 protein with G-quadruplex structures, in addition to the canonical double-stranded consensus sequence, in the context of a nuclear extract.Genome-wide SP1-binding sites correlate with G-quadruplex structure forming sequencesAfter showing that SP1 binds to a G-quadruplex in the c-kit sequence context, we next investigated whether SP1 binding sites throughout the genome have potential for G-quadruplex formation. To complement the approach of previous reports (13,16,21), who asked computationally whether predicted G-quadruplex sequences overlapped with predicted SP1 consensus, we analysed genome-wide SP1 ChIP-on-chip data (30) for the correlation of SP1 binding sites to potential G-quadruplexes using a sequence search algorithm (34).Genomic regions with a log2 fold binding ratio of β‰¥1.5 were identified as significantly enriched, resulting in 5810 genomic fragments. In order to avoid eliminating any potential SP1 consensus binding sites, we employed a minimal consensus sequence β€�GGGCGGβ€™ and its reverse complement β€�CCGCCCβ€™, and identified 7204 and 6917 motifs, respectively. To investigate whether these SP1 sites correlate with a G-quadruplex forming sequence, we defined a 46β€‰bp window, 20β€‰bp upstream and downstream of the minimal consensus, to search for potential quadruplex forming sequences (PQS) using Quadparser software (34). This algorithm considered GG-repeats of the type G2+N(1β�’7)G2+N(1β�’7)G2+N(1β�’7)G2+, where β€�Gβ€™ was a guanine, β€�Nβ€™ any of the four nucleotides and β€�2+β€™ stands for two Gs or more. It should be noted that this analysis included predicted quadruplexes with at least two tetrads, in the light of our findings with the c-kit* G-quadruplex. The analysis revealed that 87% of the enriched SP1 motif sequences overlapped with a PQS, indicating that the majority of experimentally determined SP1 protein binding sites correlate with G-quadruplex structure forming sequences.Given that the majority of the SP1 ChIP-enriched sequences were reported to lack the consensus SP1 binding motif in a limited analysis of chromosomes 21 and 22 (3), we analysed genome-wide ChIP-enriched sequences (30). In this case, 2083 sequences (36% of all enriched sequences) were found to lack the minimal SP1 consensus binding motif. Despite this, the majority of these fragments (77.4%) were found to contain at least one PQS (Table 1). Of the remaining 3727 enriched sequences (64%) containing one or more SP1 consensus motifs with the sequence β€�GGGCGGβ€™ or its reverse complement β€�CCGCCCβ€™, 99.7% contained at least one PQS. Permutation analyses of respective SP1-enriched regions, showed that none of the permutations had the same or a higher number of PQS sequences, giving empirical Pβ€‰<β€‰0.0001. These data demonstrate a strong correlation between experimentally determined SP1 binding sites and G-quadruplex structure forming sequences regardless of the presence or absence of the SP1 consensus motif.

e have identified a previously unknown -quadruplex folding structure motif situated 80β€“101β€‰bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of c- that also completely overlaps with a known 1 binding site that is known to be essential for the maximum promoter activity (23). his -quadruplex structure displayed a stable intramolecular all-anti-parallel topology with eight clearly resolved guanine imino protons in the  spectrum, consistent with a two-tetrad system. he thermal stability was determined by -melting (igure 3) and its melting transition point of 55° is in good agreement with the uadpredict software estimating 59°β€‰±β€‰10° (46). his suggests that the two-tetrad structure from this genomic sequence could, in principle, exist in physiological conditions. here has been relatively little attention paid to  with only two-tetrads in the literature, with most studies generally considering -quadruplexes with three or more tetrads. ur finding suggests that motifs capable of forming two-tetrads should not be excluded. t is noteworthy that this particular quadruplex is unusual in being the first all-anti-parallel -quadruplex except from human non-telomeric . ndeed, most  -quadruplexes studied have tended to adopt a parallel or a mixed parallel/anti-parallel topology.
revious reports have shown that zinc finger proteins have the potential to bind non-  structures. tudies on an artificial, engineered zinc finger protein have shown that a relatively modest adaptation of a classical three zinc finger transcription factor can lead to a protein that recognizes the -quadruplex fold of  (17,18). odo and co-workers demonstrated that the murine yc-associated zinc finger protein, , recognizes the duplex and -quadruplex conformations of the -element in the  promoter (47). ur data show that the zinc finger protein, 1, can bind to the -quadruplex  structure and double-stranded structure within the target site of the c- promoter with low nanomolar affinity. e performed 1 pull-down experiments from e. La cell nuclear extracts to determine the binding of SP1 in the presence of numerous other naturally occurring proteins known to interact with G-quadruplex DNA that include Poly(ADP-Ribose)polymerase-1 (48), Nucleolin (49), FANCJ (50) among others. We intentionally compare only pull-downs within the same sequence context either double- or single-stranded considering that mutations alter the sequence context in a way that SP1 might compete with different and additional proteins. The pull-down assay showed that both, ds c-kit* DNA and ss c-kit* G-quadruplex, isolated SP1 protein, thus demonstrating binding to a G-quadruplex in the presence of other cellular proteins. This observation is consistent with our FP and ELISA binding data using purified SP1; however, at this point we cannot rule out indirect effects such as proteinβ€“protein interactions. The latter effect might also be the reason why the pull-down using ss c-kit* G-quadruplex showed to be less effective than the ds c-kit*.
A selective mutation in the duplex binding site for SP1 led to reduced efficiency in the isolation of SP1 from nuclear extract, as anticipated based on previous reports in a different sequence context (45). A mutation in c-kit* that destabilizes G-quadruplex formation also led to a reduction in the efficiency of SP1 isolation (Figure 6). These findings support our hypothesis that SP1 recognizes the G-quadruplex DNA structure as an alternative-binding motif.
A computational study (16) has previously suggested that there might be a link between SP1 binding sites and putative G-quadruplex forming sequences. That particular study was established using the minimal consensus sequences GGGCGG rather than experimental SP1 binding data. Our analysis used genome wide SP1 ChIP-on-chip data and showed that there was a significant overlap (Pβ€‰<β€‰0.0001) between G-quadruplexes and SP1 binding sites. However, one has to be cautious interpreting the P-values because potential guanine quadruplex sequences are non-randomly distributed in the genome as suggested in previous analyses (34,37) and artificial randomization might not reflect real genomes. Our binding data obtained by FP, ELISA and pull-down, together with the fact that the majority of the enriched sequences with no consensus could possibly fold into a G-quadruplex, gives new insight into previously unidentified binding targets for SP1 other than the generic double stranded consensus sequence.
These data raise a number of questions regarding how the recognition of a transcription factor such as SP1 to G-quadruplex structures might have relevance for the cellular function. In relation to a potential transcription-related role, we have noted that SP1 elements protect CpG islands from de novo methylation (51). In addition, a genome-wide study has shown that G-quadruplex structures restricts methylation of CpG dinucleotides (52). Thus, one possibility is that SP1 might bind to G-quadruplex regions and prevent subsequent methylation of the sequence. Many promoter regions of housekeeping genes, which are regulated by SP1, contain methylation free islands suggesting an epigenetic role for SP1 (53,54). We conclude that our results show a hitherto unknown recognition property of SP1 that may prove to be important for the regulation of gene expression.
