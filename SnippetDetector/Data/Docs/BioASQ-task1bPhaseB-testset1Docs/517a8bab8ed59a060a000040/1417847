We first describe the presence of iodothyronine 5-deiodinase (5D) in the neural lobe of rat pituitary. 6-n-Propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU), a specific inhibitor of type-I deiodinase, had no effect, showing that 5D in neurohypophysis is of type-III isozyme, which is specific for 5-deiodination and has been found only in the brain, placenta and skin. The presence of 5D (type-III) together with our previous report of 5'-deiodinase (type-I in euthyroidism and type-II in hypothyroidism) shows that the isozymes of deiodinases in the neurohypophysis are quite similar to those in the brain. These data suggest a previously unrecognized role of thyroid hormone in posterior pituitary physiology.
