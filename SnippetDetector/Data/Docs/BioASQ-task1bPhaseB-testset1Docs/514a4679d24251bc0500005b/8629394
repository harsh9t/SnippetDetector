OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that psammoma bodies in human meningiomas contain type VI collagen and laminin. STUDY DESIGN: Two fresh human meningiomas were obtained from surgery and the frozen sections examined for type VI collagen and laminin with specific antibodies. RESULTS: Type VI collagen was found on the surface of the psammoma bodies. In addition, it was detected in the interstitial tissues surrounding the tumor cells and on the tumor cells themselves. Laminin was detected mainly in the walls of capillaries and large blood vessels. In contrast, in some psammoma bodies, laminin was detectable internally. Laminin was not found in the interstitial tissues or tumor cells. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to describe the involvement of type VI collagen in psammoma bodies and whorl formations in meningiomas. This specific type of collagen may serve an anchoring function in psammoma body development.
