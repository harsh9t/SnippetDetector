Calcification such as psammoma body is sometimes found especially in spinal cord meningioma but ossification of the meningeal tumor was rarely observed. Two cases of ossificated spinal cord meningiomas, located extramedullary intradurally apart from spinal bone, were clinicopathologically analyzed. The patients were 75-year-old female with meningioma at T9-10 level and 60-year-old female with one at T6-8 level. With pathological examination, concentration of psammoma bodies is not related to the formation of bone tissue. Metaplasia of arachnoid cell is seemed to be the origin of the bone structure.
