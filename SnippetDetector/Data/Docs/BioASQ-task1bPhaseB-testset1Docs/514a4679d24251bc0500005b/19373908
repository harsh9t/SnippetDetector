Psammoma bodies (PBs) are concentric lamellated calcified structures, observed most commonly in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), meningioma, and papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary but have rarely been reported in other neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions. PBs are said to represent a process of dystrophic calcification. Despite numerous ancillary studies over a span of three and half decades, formation of PBs remains a poorly understood mechanism. Ultrastructural study of PTC has shown that thickening of the base lamina in vascular stalk of neoplastic papillae followed by thrombosis, calcification, and tumor cell necrosis leads to formation of PBs. Studies on serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and meningioma, however, revealed that collagen production by neoplastic cells and subsequent calcification was responsible for the formation of PBs. The existence of some precursor forms of PBs was reported in meningiomas and more recently in PTC, which were mostly in the form of extracellular hyaline globules surrounded by well-preserved neoplastic cells or in a smaller number of cases intracytoplasmic bodies liberated from intact tumor cells. Cellular degeneration and necrosis, leading to the disappearance of neoplastic cells, were noticed by us only around PBs but not around the precursor forms. Based on the above findings, it is suggested that rather than being the outcome of dystrophic calcification of dead or dying tissue, PBs may indeed represent an active biologic process ultimately leading to degeneration/death of tumor cells and retardation of growth of the neoplasm. It may also serve as a barrier against the spread of neoplasm.
