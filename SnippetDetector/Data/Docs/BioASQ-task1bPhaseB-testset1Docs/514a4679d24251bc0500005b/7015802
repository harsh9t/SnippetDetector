<abstract>
Twenty human meningiomas were examined for IgG and IgM by the direct immunofluorescence of immunoperoxidase methods, or both. IgG was conspicuously found in and around the blood vessels, whorls, and psammoma bodies. It was also clearly present on the cytoplasmic membranes of the tumour cells. On the other hand, IgM was seen only within the blood vessels. Significance of these findings is briefly discussed including possible humoral immune reactions in regard to whorl and psammoma body formation in meningioma.
