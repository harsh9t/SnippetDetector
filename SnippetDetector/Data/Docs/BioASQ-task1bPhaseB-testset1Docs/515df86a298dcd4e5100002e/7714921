Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the biosynthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GAD has been suggested as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stiff-man syndrome. Recently, three forms of membrane-associated GAD (MGAD) have been characterized in porcine brain, but the subcellular localization and function of these proteins are unknown. We present evidence that GAD activity is associated with synaptic vesicles from porcine brain. These vesicles contain a 60 kDa protein recognized by serum from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, probably MGADII, as shown by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting. These results raise the possibility that the association of MGADII with synaptic vesicles may be crucial for its role as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
