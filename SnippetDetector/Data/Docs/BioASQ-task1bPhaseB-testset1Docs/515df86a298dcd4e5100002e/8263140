Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Approximately 60% of patients with SMS have high titers of autoantibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Similar to SMS, the majority of patients with IDDM have autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase at or before diabetes onset, although usually at a lower titer and with a different reaction pattern than patients with SMS. To investigate the immunogenetic basis of SMS, we HLA-typed 18 patients with the disease. Seventy-two percent carried the DQB1*0201 allele (13 of 18, P = 0.02 vs. 18 of 48 controls), indicating that SMS is associated with this allele. DQB1*0201 is also a susceptibility allele for IDDM and other autoimmune diseases. Patients with SMS carried the IDDM-protective DQB1*0602 allele and other sequence-related DQB1*06 alleles with the same frequency observed in controls. In contrast, these alleles are rarely found in IDDM. Five of 8 (62.5%) SMS patients lacking a DQB1*06 allele were diabetic in contrast to only 2 of 10 (20%) with a DQB1*06 allele (P = 0.08), suggesting that the presence of DQB1*0602 or other DQB1*06 alleles may be associated with a reduced prevalence of diabetes among patients with SMS.
