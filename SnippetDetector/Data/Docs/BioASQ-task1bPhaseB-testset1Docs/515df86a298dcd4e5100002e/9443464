We report a patient who developed stiff-man syndrome, including disabling shoulder subluxation and wrist ankylosis, in association with breast cancer. Immunologic investigations disclosed autoimmunity directed against not only glutamic acid decarboxylase but also amphiphysin, a 128-kd protein located in the presynaptic compartment of neurons. The patient improved after surgery and corticosteroid treatment and has been stable for nearly 4 years on only anti-estrogenics. The triad of stiff-man syndrome, breast cancer, and autoantibodies against amphiphysin identifies a new autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of the CNS.
