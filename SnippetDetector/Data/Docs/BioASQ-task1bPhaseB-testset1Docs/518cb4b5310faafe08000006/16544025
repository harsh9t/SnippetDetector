Among the amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunctions, thyrotoxicosis is the most troublesome and with the highest rate of morbidity and mortality. Treatment consists in the use of a high dose of anti-thyroid drugs and steroids in an isolated form or in combination. Association of several other drugs have been proposed for the treatment of refractory cases. In this study we report the case of a 40 y.o. patient, with a history of idiopatic dilated miocardiopathy, who developed severe amioradone-induced thyrotoxicosis after heart transplantation. Since the patient did not respond to an initial treatment consisting of a high dose of anti-thyroid drugs combined with steroids, a low dose of lithium carbonate was added for a short period of time, which resulted in normalization of the thyroid function. In this case, the addition of lithium carbonate to the two other drugs resulted in a successful and safety therapy in controlling amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.
