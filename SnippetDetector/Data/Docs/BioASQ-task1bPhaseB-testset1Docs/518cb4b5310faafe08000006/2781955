<abstract>
Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with thionamide, lithium or radioactive iodine is ineffective. This particular form of hyperthyroidism is long-lasting because of the slow elimination of amiodarone. Therefore, an alternative therapy is necessary, especially for patients who need to continue permanent administration of the drug. We report 2 cases of AIT: in one case, amiodarone was interrupted; in the other case, amiodarone was continued because of recurrent ventricular tachycardia resistant to classical antiarrhythmic drugs. Both patients were successfully treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and dexamethasone (DXT).
