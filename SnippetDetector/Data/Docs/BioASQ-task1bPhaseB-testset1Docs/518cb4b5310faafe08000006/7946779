Two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis were treated successfully with potassium perchlorate and carbimazole while treatment with amiodarone was continued. These antithyroid drugs were stopped after the patients had became clinically and biochemically euthyroid. During follow up, when treatment with amiodarone continued, thyrotoxicosis did not recur. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis seems to be a transient condition that can be treated successfully with a short course of antithyroid drugs without stopping amiodarone treatment.
