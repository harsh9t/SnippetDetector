A female patient was admitted to our Department for total thyroidectomy in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. The drug was prescribed for ventricular arrhythmia and atrial paroxysmal fibrillation in dilated cardiomyopathy due to chronic aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 35%; Class Functional NYHA III) and moderate-severe respiratory insufficiency. The cardiologist-anesthetist team has allowed to evaluate the surgical-cardiovascular-anesthesiologic risks and the balance between the improvement by the amiodarone administration for the arrhythmia, and the discontinuation of this treatment in order to prevent aggravation of the thyrotoxicosis. These hypotheses were subsequently discharged for the two reasons listed below: - several other antiarrhytmic drugs (that didn't show equivalent efficacy as amiodarone in preventing or converting such ventricular and atrial arrhythmias) may be proposed in the place of amiodarone. However, this could expose the patient to an arrhythmia; - a clear proof that the suspension of amiodarone can allow restoring normalization of the thyroid function doesn't exist. Therefore, the patient has been successfully submitted to the surgical intervention and in the follow-up we brought her back to a state of normalized thyroid function and cardiovascular conditions. In patients that cannot safely discontinue amiodarone or when medical therapy is ineffective in controlling thyrotoxicosis, thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice.
