Deciphering the molecular basis of cancer is critical for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. To better understand the early molecular events involving osteogenic sarcoma (OGS), we have initiated a program to identify potential tumor suppressor genes. Expression profiling of total RNA from ten normal bone cell lines and eleven OGS-derived cell lines by microarray showed 135-fold lower expression of FRZB/sFRP3 mRNA in OGS cells compared to bone cells; this down-regulation of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression was found to be serum-independent. Subsequently, fourteen OGS biopsy specimens showed nine-fold down-regulation of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression compared to expression in eight normal bone specimens as determined by microarray. FRZB /sFRP3 protein level was also found to be at a very low level in 4/4 OGS cell lines examined. Quantitation by RT-PCR indicated approximately 70% and approximately 90% loss of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression in OGS biopsy specimens and OGS-derived cell lines respectively, compared to expression in bone (p<0.0001). Hybridization experiments of a cDNA microarray containing paired normal and tumor specimens from nineteen different organs did not show any significant difference in the level of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression between the normal and the corresponding tumor tissues. Exogenous expression of FRZB/sFRP3 mRNA in two OGS-derived cell lines lacking endogenous expression of the mRNA produced abundant mRNA from the exogenous gene, eliminating degradation as a possibility for very low level of FRZB/sFRP3 mRNA in OGS specimens. Results from PCR-based experiments suggest that the FRZB/sFRP3 gene is not deleted in OGS cell lines, however, karyotyping shows gross abnormalities involving chromosome 2 (location of the FRZB gene) in five of twelve OGS-derived cell lines. Together, these data suggest a tumor-suppressive potential for FRZB/sFRP3 in OGS.
