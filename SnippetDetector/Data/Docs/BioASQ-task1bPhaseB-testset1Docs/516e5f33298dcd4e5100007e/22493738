Introduction
epatocellular carcinoma () is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh in women in the world, and the new cases of  in developing countries accounted for almost 85% of all patients [1]. he major risk factors for  include chronic infections with the hepatitis  or  viruses, alcohol consumption, and foodstuff contamination with aflatoxins [2]β€“[5]. mong those, the hepatitis  virus () infection is of particular interest, for its coherent distribution with the  prevalence [6]. n hina, although national vaccination of  has been carried out for years, the infection rate of  is still at a high level, approximately 5β€“8% in the general population [7], [8]. owever, only a small fraction of  persistent carriers developed , suggesting genetic variation may play roles in the carcinogenesis of  after  infection. esides,  persistent infection or  natural clearance may also be influenced by complex factors of viral, host age, environmental and genetic makeups.
ased on the latest knowledge,  is no longer only the bridge between  and protein [9]. n recent years, more and more non-coding s have been identified, including short non-coding s(micro. RNAs) and long non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs). Guttman et al found over a thousand highly conserved lncRNAs in mammals through chromatin signature mapping [10]. However, few publications focused on the origin and biological functions of lncRNAs than those of microRNAs. Recently, several studies reported that lncRNAs were dysregulated in different caners [11]β€“[13], though their specific roles in caner development and progression were largely unknown.
HULC, short for Highly Up-regulated in Liver Cancer, is about 1.6 k nucleotide long, containing two exons but not translated [13]. It has been identified that HULC is highly upregulated in HCC and colorectal cancer that metastasized to livers
[13], [14]. MALAT1, abbreviation of Metastasis-Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1, is about 8k nucleotide long and has been demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers including HCC [11], [12].
Genetic variations in lncRNAs and their associations with cancer susceptibility have rarely been reported. Recently, Jin G et al reported the association between polymorphisms in lncRNAs and prostate cancer [15]. In this study, we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HULC and MALAT1 may contribute to risk of HBV chronic infection and HCC. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study of 1300 HBV-positive HCC patients, 1344 HBV persistent carriers and 1344 subjects with HBV natural clearance to assess the associations between SNPs in HULC and MALAT1 and the susceptibility to HBV chronic infection and HCC.

Methods
tudy ubjects. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Nanjing Medical University. The subjectsβ€™ enrollment was described previously [16]. The newly diagnosed HCC patients were consecutively recruited between January 2006 and December 2010 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, the Nantong Tumor Hospital, and the Qidong liver cancer institute of Jiangsu Province, China. Each patient was confirmed by a pathological examination and/or Ξ±-fetoprotein elevation (>400 ng/ml) combined with imaging examination (Magnetic resonance imaging, MRI and/or computerized tomography, CT). Eventually, 1300 HBV positive (HCV negative) HCC cases were included.The controls were screened for the HBV/HCV markers from two cities in Jiangsu Province (9720 persons from Changzhou and 48422 persons from Zhangjiagang) in 2004 and 2009, respectively. Two groups of controls were used in the current study, one is the HBV persistent carriers and the other is persons with HBV natural clearance. HBV persistent carriers were positive for both HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), negative for HCV antibody (anti-HCV). Subjects with HBV natural clearance were negative for HBsAg and anti-HCV, plus positive for both antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and anti-HBc. These people declared no hepatitis B vaccination history. About 865 (8.9%) HBV persistent carriers and 1759 (18.1%) subjects with HBV natural clearance were identified from Changzhou; while 2156 (4.5%) HBV persistent carriers and 7851 (16.2%) subjects with HBV natural clearance were identified from Zhangjiagang. Then, we randomly selected 1344 HBV persistent carriers and 1344 HBV natural clearance people from the two cities, which were matched to the HCC cases on age and sex. These selected controls declared no previous malignancy.All participants were unrelated ethnic Han Chinese. After written informed consent was obtained, each participant was surveyed by a structured questionnaire to collect demographic and exposure information. Individuals who smoked one cigarette per day for over one year were defined as smokers, and those who consumed one or more alcohol drinks a week for over six months were categorized as alcohol drinkers. After the interview, about 5 milliliter venous blood sample was collected from each participant.Serological TestingHBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were detected from each participantβ€™s serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Kehua Bio-engineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) following the manufacturerβ€™s instructions as described previously [16].SNPs Selection and GenotypingBased on the data from Hapmap database and the criteria of minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05 in Han Chinese, we found five common SNPs (rs1328868, rs2038540, rs1328867, rs7763881 and rs1328866) in HULC, all of which are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD). Thus, we genotyped only one SNP, rs7763881. Similarly, there are five common SNPs (rs11227209, rs619586, rs7927113, rs664589 and rs3200401) in MALAT1, all of which are in one LD block and we chose rs619586 as the tagging SNP.Genomic DNA was extracted from a leukocyte pellet by traditional proteinase K digestion and followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. SNPs rs7763881 A>C and rs619586 A>G were genotyped using the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay on a 7900 system (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The primers and probes for rs7763881 were as follows: Primer: sense, 5'-GGATAAAGGAATTCTGGGAAATGTAG-3', antisense, 5'-GGTGCTGTGTTGTGGATTTGC-3'; Probe: allele A, FAM-TTTGTCTGAATTGACCTAT-MGB, allele C, HEX-TTGTCTGACTTGACCTAT-MGB. The primers and probes for rs619586 were as follows: Primer: sense, 5'-AAAGCCCTGAACTATCACACTTTAATC-3', antisense, 5'-CACAAAACCCCCGGAACTT-3'; Probe: allele A, FAM-ACTATACCTACTGTCCC-MGB, allele G, HEX-CTATACCTGCTGTCCC-MGB. The genotyping was performed blindly without knowing the subjectsβ€™ case or control status. Two blank (water) controls in each 384-well plate were used for quality control and more than 10% samples were randomly selected to repeat, yielding a 100% concordance rate.Statistical AnalysisDifferences of demographic characteristics and genotype frequencies of the two SNPs between the cases and controls were calculated by the Studentβ€™s t-test (for continuous variables) and Ο‡2 test (for categorical variables). Associations between the genotypes and risk of HCC and HBV chronic infection were estimated by computing odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from logistic regression analyses. Heterogeneity of associations between subgroups was assessed by the Ο‡2 -based Q test. All of the statistical analyses were performed with R software (version 2.13.0; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). All tests were two-sided and the criterion of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
he demographic characteristics of the 1300  positive  patients, 1344  persistent carriers and 1344 subjects with  nature clearance were summarized previously [16]. here were no significant differences in the distribution of age, sex and smoking rate between the three groups. owever, the drinking rate was significantly higher in  cases than that in controls ( both  < 0.001 for  cases compare to  persistent carriers and clearance controls).
he genotyping call rates were 98.2% for rs7763881 and 98.5% for rs619589 and the observed genotype frequencies among the controls were in  ( β€�=β€� 0.785 and 0.453 for rs7763881 and rs619586, respectively). he genotype distributions of the two variants in  positive  cases,  persistent carriers and  natural clearance subjects are shown in able 1. ompared with individuals carrying wild-type  genotype of rs7763881, those with  and  genotypes had a decreased  risk with adjusted s of 0.79 (95% s β€�=β€� 0.66β€“0.95) and 0.87 (95% s β€�=β€� 0.70β€“1.09), respectively. he variant / genotypes of rs7763881 significantly decreased  risk by 19% (djusted  β€�=β€� 0.81, 95% s β€�=β€� 0.68β€“0.97,  β€�=β€� 0.022). imilarly, variant genotypes of rs6682925 were associated with non-significant decreased  risk compared with the wild-type  genotype (adjusted  β€�=β€� 0.82, 95% s β€�=β€� 0.66β€“1.03 for ; adjusted β€�=β€� 0.50, 95% sβ€�=β€�0.17β€“1.50 for ). he variant genotypes / of rs619586 was associated with a decreased  risk with a borderline significance (adjusted  β€�=β€� 0.81, 95%s β€�=β€� 0.65β€“1.01,  β€�=β€� 0.057). owever, no significant association was found between the two s and  clearance.

Discussion
o the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has provided evidence that common s in lnc. RNAs might be associated with HCC susceptibility. We identified rs7763881 in HULC was significantly associated with HCC susceptibility in HBV persistent carriers, while rs619586 was protective for non-drinkersβ€™ HCC risk in subgroup analysis.
Panzitt et al firstly reported that HULC was highly up-regulated in HCC as a novel non-coding RNA [13]. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HULC in 2 HCC cell lines resulted in altered expression of several genes, some of which were known to be affected in HCC, including cyclin-dependent kinase 8 and MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 [13]. Furthermore, the expression of HULC was extremely tissue-specific. Panzitt et al reported that HULC was not detected in tissues other than liver or their associated neoplasms [13]. Matouk et al reported that HULC was detected in colorectal carcinomas that metastasize to livers, but not the primary colorectal carcinomas samples nor their normal counterparts [13], [14].
Based on the Hapmap database, there are five SNPs in HULC, all of which are in high LD. Among those, rs7763881 was in complete LD with rs1328867 (r-square β€�=β€� 1), which is located in the promoter region of HULC. According to data from UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu) and TFSEARCH 1.3, the wild-type allele T of rs1328867 is predicted to bind several transcription factors including C-Myc, while the variant allele C is not. C-Myc plays critical roles in regulating cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis in both normal and neoplastic liver cells [17]. In our study, with a relative large sample size and a power of 76%, we found that the variant allele C of rs7763881 was associated with a decreased HCC risk, which was consistent with the biological relevance of HULC.
MALAT1 is highly conserved within the mammalian lineage [18]. It is enriched in nuclear speckles in inter-phase cells and concentrates in mitotic interchromatin granule clusters [19]. It is co-localized with pre-mRNA-splicing factor SF2/ASF and CC3 antigen in the nuclear speckles [20]. MALAT1 was found rearranged in renal tumors harboring the t(6;11)(p21;q13) translocation andΒ in a liver mesenchymal hamartoma harboring the t(11;19)(q11;q13.4) translocation [21], [22]. In this study, we found that MALAT1 rs619586 was associated with a decreased HCC risk with a borderline significance and was significantly protective for HCC risk in never drinkers. The lack of significance in the overall population might be due to the modest association and the relative low MAF of the SNP (MAF β€�=β€� 0.11), and we have only about 40% power to detect the effect in this population with our current sample size. Larger studies are warranted to clarify the associations between rs619586 in MALAT1 and HCC risk.
In conclusion, the variant genotypes of rs7763881 in HULC may contribute to decreased HCC susceptibility in HBV persistent carriers. Association studies with diverse population and further functional studies of the variants are warranted to confirm our findings.
