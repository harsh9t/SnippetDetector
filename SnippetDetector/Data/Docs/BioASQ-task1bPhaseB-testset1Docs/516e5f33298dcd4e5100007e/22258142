A negative selection strategy was used in the present study to isolate long polyA-minus RNAs from the total transcriptome and a long non-coding RNA named Yiya was identified. Yiya is a 1.9 kb long intergenic ncRNA gene mapped to chromosome 1q41, a well-established cancer susceptibility locus. Expression profiling revealed a general and regulated expression pattern of Yiya in major tissues, and more interestingly, identified elevated mRNA levels in different cancers. Quantitative analysis further demonstrated a dynamic regulation of Yiya expression in cell cycle progression, suggesting that it was involved in cell cycle regulation. Supporting this, overexpression of Yiya promotes cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition, therefore identifying Yiya as a cell-cycle-associated long non-coding RNA.
