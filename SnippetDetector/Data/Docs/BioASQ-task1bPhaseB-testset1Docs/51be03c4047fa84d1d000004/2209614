A simple procedure based on perchloric acid extraction has been developed for the preparation and purification of bovine prothymosin alpha and thymosins beta 4 and beta 9 in high yields. Spectroscopic observations show these proteins to be non-folding at neural pH. The cellular locations of human prothymosin alpha, rat parathymosin and calf thymosin beta 4, all so-called 'thymic hormones', have been studied by injection into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes, followed by separate monitoring of nuclear and cytoplasmic concentrations. It is shown that human prothymosin alpha and rat parathymosin both migrate to the nucleus whilst thymosin beta 4 remains in the cytoplasm. The peptide (1-88) of calf prothymosin alpha is shown not to accumulate in the Xenopus nucleus, demonstrating that the C-terminal 21 residues, which include a KKQK sequence, are required for nuclear migration. The present data, in association with existing evidence of wide tissue distribution and the lack of signal peptides, indicate that these proteins do not behave as hormones in the usual sense of the word. It is suggested that thymosin beta 4 should be grouped separately from the pro- and parathymosins.
