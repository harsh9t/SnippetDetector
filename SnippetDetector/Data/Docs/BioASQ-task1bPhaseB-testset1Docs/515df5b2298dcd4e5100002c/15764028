Stem cell transplantation approaches offer for the first time the opportunity to design therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis (MS) with curative intent. Here we discuss key observations and questions emerging from clinical trials of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for MS and from studies of myelin/neural repair in experimental models of demyelinating disorders.
