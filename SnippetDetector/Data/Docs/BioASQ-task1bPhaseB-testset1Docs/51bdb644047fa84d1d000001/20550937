In metazoa, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) assemble from disassembled precursors into a reforming nuclear envelope (NE) at the end of mitosis and into growing intact NEs during interphase. Here, we show via RNAi-mediated knockdown that ELYS, a nucleoporin critical for the recruitment of the essential Nup107/160 complex to chromatin, is required for NPC assembly at the end of mitosis but not during interphase. Conversely, the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. Strikingly, recruitment of the Nup107/160 complex to an intact NE involves a membrane curvature-sensing domain of its constituent Nup133, which is not required for postmitotic NPC formation. Our results suggest that in organisms with open mitosis, NPCs assemble via two distinct mechanisms to accommodate cell cycle-dependent differences in NE topology.
