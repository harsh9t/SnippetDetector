High resolution 31P-NMR has been used for the non-invasive observation of metabolites and metabolic rates in blood of normal mice and of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria. 31P-NMR was used to quantitate levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in whole cells as a function of the degree of parasitemia and yielded good agreement with the results of enzymatic assays. The time-dependence of 31P metabolites was monitored in both normal and infected erythrocytes, greater rates of decay of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate being observed in malarial blood which correlate with the level of parasitemia. Very high metabolic rates of infected cells render measurement of intracellular pH unreliable on freshly drawn whole blood. When appropriate measures are taken to avoid this complication, no difference is observed in the intracellular pH of parasitized and non-parasitized erythrocytes from infected animals. In both normal and parasitized mice the intraerythrocytic pH is more acidic than that of the suspending medium by 0.15 pH unit at 25 degrees C. Unlike free-living protozoa, the parasitic protozoan Plasmodium does not contain detectable levels of phosphonates or polyphosphates, in either whole cells or perchloric acid extracts thereof.
