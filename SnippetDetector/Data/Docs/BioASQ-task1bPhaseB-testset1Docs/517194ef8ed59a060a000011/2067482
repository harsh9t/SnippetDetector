The feasibility was determined of influencing Ae. aegypti sensitivity to bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum by sublethal concentrations of herbicides (ordram and propanide) and fungicides (fundozol and blue vitriol) introduced into the larvae habitation medium or into the imago feed. No stable changes in the infectivity of test female individuals, as compared to the control, have been observed. Specific action of the group of preparations under study has been noted. It has been shown that the use of herbicides causes a decrease in some parameters of the vector potential (survival and aggressiveness) of the survived insects, however, it is accompanied by a tendency towards enhanced invasion by malaria plasmodia. The treatment of larvae with fungicides has less effect on the viability of the imago and their reaction to the prey, however, unlike herbicides, fungicides are associated with a tendency towards reduced Ae. aegypti sensitivity to P. gallinaceum. When fungicides are added to the imago feed the indexes of test female individuals infectivity do not differ from the control ones.
