Chloroquine has been the mainstay of antimalarial chemotherapy but the rapid spread of resistance to this important drug has now compromised its efficacy. The mechanism of chloroquine resistance has not been known but recent evidence from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, suggested similarities to the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) of mammalian tumour cells which is mediated by a protein molecule termed P-glycoprotein. Two mdr genes (pfmdr1 and pfmdr2) encoding P-glycoprotein homologues have been identified in P. falciparum and one of these (pfmdr1) has several alleles that have been linked to the chloroquine resistance phenotype. In contrast analysis of a genetic cross between chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive P. falciparum has suggested that the genes encoding the known P-glycoprotein homologues are not linked. This review outlines the similarities of the chloroquine resistance phenotype with the MDR phenotype of mammalian tumour cells and explores the possible role of the pfmdr genes.
