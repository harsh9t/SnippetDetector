The paper provides evidence that the An. sacharovi females which do not develop mature eggs after blood-sucking on the malaria-infected donor could not be infected by the bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum. The addition of juvemon (an analogue of juvenile hormone) to glucose solution (mosquito carbohydrate diet) before blood meal stimulates the vitellogenesis of the mosquito after blood digestion, as clearly demonstrated on the female with an incomplete portion of the infected blood. This study has demonstrated that the juvemon does not exert a direct effect on mosquito susceptibility to the bird malaria agent, but it increases the number of females with mature eggs, thus promoting the increase in the percentage of the infected specimens and the number of oocysts.
