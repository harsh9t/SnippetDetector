A laboratory model of circulation of the malaria causative agent P. gallinaceum has been used to show that the effect of precocene (antijuvenoid) leads to a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of infected females developing eggs after blood suction. The females failing to develop eggs are not infected. Trichopol (antiexdisone) inhibits vitellogenesis The females undeveloping eggs become susceptible to the causative agent though to a lesser degree than those developing them. The findings suggest that there is an association of the mosquito susceptibility to the malaria causative agent with the balance of hormones in the body of disease the carrier.
