Mosquitos Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi contact with sublethal doses of deltametrin and cypermetrin pyretroids at larval stage and in grown state, when diet includes sugar with pyretroids, had no influence on the sensitivity of survived females to malaria agents P. gallinaceum and P. berghei. Mosquitos under experiment showed no obvious inhibition of the physiological condition in comparison with the control ones.
