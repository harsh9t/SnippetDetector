Trypanosomes do not inhabit or grow in anopheles mosquitoes, the vector for the transmission of Plasmodium parasites the causative agent for malaria. The possession of lytic factors by the anopheline mosquito was thus considered. Head and midgut sections prepared in phosphate buffered saline were tested for trypanocidal action against T. congolense. While the head section was inactive towards the trypanosomes, the midgut extract at 0.2 mg ml(-1) diminished the motility of the parasites within 2 min of incubation; killing 50% of the population after 5 min. At 0.5 mg ml(-1) of the extract, about 90% of the parasites were killed within 2 min of incubation. The midgut fraction was subjected to a purification protocol involving successive chromatography on: octyl-sepharose, reactive brown agarose and fetuin-agarose columns. A final trypanocidal active fraction (gp45), which moved homogeneously during electrophoresis as a 45-kDa protein, was recovered from the fetuin-agarose column. The protein reacted positively with thiobarbituric acid, which suggests it is a sialoglycoprotein. Desialylation of the glycoprotein nullified its trypanocidal activity on T. congolense. Similarly, when the saccharides, lactose, methyl-beta-galactoside, lactulose, methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-galactoside (MU-Gal), were included in the culture medium, they inhibited the gp45 trypanocidal activity. Asialo-fetuin and asialo-RBC also inhibited the gp45-induced killing of T. congolense cells. The potential use of anopheline 45 kDa protein in the production of transgenic tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) in the control of trypanosomiasis is discussed.
