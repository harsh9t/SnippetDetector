A novel family of 1H-imidazol-2-yl-pyrimidine-4,6-diamines has been identified with potent activity against the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most common causative agent of malaria. A systematic SAR study resulted in the identification of compound 40 which exhibits good potency against both wild-type and drug resistant parasites and exhibits good in vivo pharmacokinetic properties.
