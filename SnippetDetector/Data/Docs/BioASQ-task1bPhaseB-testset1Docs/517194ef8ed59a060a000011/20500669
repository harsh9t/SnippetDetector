Dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages phagocytose pathogens and degrade them in their phagosomes to allow for proper presentation of foreign antigens to other cells of the immune system. The Plasmodium parasite, causative agent of malaria, infects RBC that are phagocytosed by DC and macrophages during the course of infection. Under specific conditions, the functionality of these cells can be affected by phagocytosis of Plasmodium-infected RBC. We investigated whether phagosomal maturation and degradation of Plasmodium yoelii-infected RBC in phagosomes is affected in DC and macrophages. We show that recruitment of the phagolysosomal marker Lamp-1 and of MHC-II, as well as acidification of phagosomes, was achieved in a timely manner. Using P. yoelii-infected RBC labelled with a fluorescent dye or transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing parasites, we found a gradual, rapid decrease in the phagosome fluorescence signal, indicating that P. yoelii-infected RBC are efficiently degraded in macrophages and DC. We also observed that pre-incubation of DC with infected RBC did not affect phagosomal maturation of newly internalized P. yoelii-infected RBC. In conclusion, after phagocytosis, Plasmodium-infected RBC are degraded by DC and macrophages, suggesting that the process of phagosomal maturation is effectively completed in malaria.
