Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, uses multiple ligand-receptor interactions to invade host red blood cells (RBCs). We studied the invasion of P falciparum into abnormal RBCs from humans carrying the Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) trait. One particular parasite line, 3D7-A, invaded these cells efficiently, whereas all other lines studied invaded SAO RBCs to only about 20% of the extent of normal (non-SAO) cells. This result is consistent with the clinical observation that SAO individuals can experience high-density P falciparum infections and provides an explanation for previous discrepant results on invasion of SAO RBCs. Characterization of the invasion phenotype of 3D7-A revealed that efficient invasion of SAO RBCs was paralleled by relatively efficient invasion of normal RBCs treated with either neuraminidase, trypsin, or chymotrypsin and a novel capacity to invade normal RBCs treated sequentially with both neuraminidase and trypsin. Our results suggest that only parasites able to use some particular invasion pathways can invade SAO RBCs efficiently in culture. A similar situation might occur in the field.
