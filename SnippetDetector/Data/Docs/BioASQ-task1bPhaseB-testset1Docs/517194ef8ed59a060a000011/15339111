In the Republic of Yemen, Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant causative agent of malaria and is associated with adverse consequences for pregnant women and their babies. The prevalence and clinical manifestations of malaria among 500 pregnant (260) and non-pregnant (240) women were compared. Clinical examinations, laboratory investigations and a structured questionnaire were used to collect data. The prevalence of malaria was higher among pregnant women (55%) than non-pregnant women (20%). Anaemia was significantly more prevalent among pregnant woman than non-pregnant women and also more prevalent in pregnant women with malaria than non-pregnant women with malaria.
