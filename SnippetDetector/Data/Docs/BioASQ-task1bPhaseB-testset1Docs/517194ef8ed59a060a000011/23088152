<abstract>
The global area for Plasmodium ovale is small as compared with that for other species of human malaria pathogens. It has expanded in Asian areas and remained as before in the African ones. In the past 20 years, there have been 2129 malaria cases imported from far abroad to Russia, including 84 (4%) cases of vivax malaria (P. ovale). The patients were most foreign citizens: 70 from 20 African countries and 7 from two countries of Oceania, such as Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The other 7 patients were Russia's people who had returned from different countries of Africa. For this period there have been a total of 5 cases of mixed infection: tropical P. falciparum malaria + vivax P. ovale malaria. The mission of detected new sympatric subspecies (P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri) inhabiting the tropical countries with continuous local transmission remains unclear. Only a thorough study of these subspecies will be able to effectively apply preventive measures and to carry out their elimination in future.
