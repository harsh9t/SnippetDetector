It has been shown on the model pair Ae. aegypti-P. gallinaceum that dimilin, an inhibitor of insect chitin synthesis has practically no effect on female sensitivity to malaria agent. An analogue of the juvenile hormone juvemon at a concentration of 0.001-0.002 mg/l, causing death of 35% of insects, produces a 7-17% decrease in sporozoite index value. In concentration of 0.004-0.05 mg/l, there is a tendency towards an increase in the vector capacity of the survived female individuals. No differences in the intensity of infection have been revealed between test and control female individuals. No noticeable inhibition of the physiological conditions of test female individuals determined by the following parameters: activity of their aggression towards the donor and their death before and alter the infective feeding have been observed. Thus, none of the substances tested is an inhibitor of the development of malaria plasmodia and their vectors.
