The capacity of An. sacharovi and An. pulcherrimus to be infected with P. gallinaceum and to transmit the agent to the vertebrate host, a chick, has been established. Sufficient differences have been found in the extensiveness and intensity of infection of different species of mosquitoes and in other characteristics reflecting the agent-vector relationships.
