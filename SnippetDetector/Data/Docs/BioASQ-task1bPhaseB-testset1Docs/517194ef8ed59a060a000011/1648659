On a model pair Aedes aegypti--Plasmodium gallinaceum in has been shown that changes in the conditions of larvae development caused by the addition into the water medium of the live culture of Synochocystis sp. cyanobacteria or green seaweeds Chlorella vulgaris, acetone extracts from the live culture precipitate or Chlorella powder, as well as nitrogen-containing fertilizer--ammonium chloride did not lower the sensitivity of the imago flying to malaria parasites. The results of the experiments assessing the effect of biologically active compounds introduced into the larvae habitation medium on the ability to change sensitivity of the survived mosquito females to malaria agent have been summed up. The data obtained are indicative of the high level of mutual adaptation between mosquito-carriers and malaria parasites.
