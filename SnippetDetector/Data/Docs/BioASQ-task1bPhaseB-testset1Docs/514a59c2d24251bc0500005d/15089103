A controlled-release (CR) formulation of the SSRI paroxetine has been developed. This CR formulation delays the release of paroxetine until the tablet has passed through the stomach; the drug is then released over 4-5 hours. In well designed placebo-controlled trials in patients with major depressive disorder (including a study in the elderly), social anxiety disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), paroxetine CR was consistently superior to placebo with regards to primary endpoints (i.e. mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score [major depressive disorder], Liebowitz social anxiety scale total score and Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement score [social anxiety disorder] and Visual Analogue Scale-Mood score [PMDD]). The duration of treatment was 12 weeks or, in PMDD, over three menstrual cycles (intermittent or continuous administration). Paroxetine CR also demonstrated efficacy in three well designed studies in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Paroxetine CR was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with an adverse-event profile typical of SSRIs, although recipients of paroxetine CR experienced significantly less nausea than recipients of immediate-release paroxetine in the first week of treatment.
