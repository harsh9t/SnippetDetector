OBJECTIVE: This clinical trial evaluated luteal phase dosing with paroxetine controlled release (CR) (12.5 mg and 25 mg) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, fixed-dose study of luteal phase dosing with paroxetine CR in the treatment of PMDD. Three hundred seventy-three patients with PMDD were randomly assigned into the study. The primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in the mean luteal visual analogue scale (VAS)-Mood score. Secondary efficacy measures included disorder-specific evaluations, global assessments of disease severity, and assessments of functional impairment. Adverse events were recorded throughout the trial. RESULTS: Patients treated with either dose of paroxetine CR demonstrated significantly greater improvements on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in mean luteal phase VAS-Mood scores) and on the majority of secondary efficacy measures compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo. CONCLUSION: For the treatment of PMDD, luteal phase dosing with 12.5 mg and 25 mg of paroxetine CR is effective and generally well tolerated.
