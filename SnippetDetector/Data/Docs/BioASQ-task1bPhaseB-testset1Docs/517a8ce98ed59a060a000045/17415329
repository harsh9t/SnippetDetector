We report a case of bacterial pericarditis in an immunologically competent adult female caused by nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) that was complicated by the acute development of life-threatening pericardial tamponade. H influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus, a pathogen most frequently associated with childhood exanthema (otitis media, meningitis) and, less frequently, adult pneumonia. Encapsulated, type b, or typable H influenzae is the strain implicated in childhood infections. On the other hand, nonencapsulated or nontypable H influenzae is the specific strain most often associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive airway disease. Bacterial pericarditis caused by either subtype of H influenzae is exceedingly rare. We have located only 15 previously reported cases of H influenzae pericarditis occurring in adults in the world medical literature, the majority of which date back to the pre-antibiotic era. In 12 of these 15 cases (the only cases in which typing could be accomplished), the encapsulated strain of H influenzae was cultured from the pericardial fluid. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, we are reporting here the first case of bacterial pericarditis caused by nonencapsulated H influenzae in an immunologically competent adult.
