We describe a case of a 56 year old man with myopericarditis complicated with cardiogenic shock within first 3 days, mimicking on admission acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation in inferior ECG leads. Additionally, patient presented hyperthyroidism and totally decompensated diabetes mellitus. He required during the first 3 days intravenous infusion of inotropic agents. Cardiac enzymes levels were elevated. Akinesia in mid-inferior and mid-posterior regions in ECHO was observed. On the 10th day ST segment elevation in I, II, V3-V6 and ST depression in aVR was observed in ECG. After stabilisation patient underwent coronarography which showed normal coronary arteries. The final diagnosis was acute myopericarditis complicated with acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
