<abstract>
Acute purulent pericarditis is a well-recognized, though infrequently  seen, manifestation of systemic Haemophilus influenzae type b disease. We recently studied two pediatric patients who developed signs of this septic complication during appropriate antibiotic treatment for bacteremia. These case reports should alert physicians to the possibility that pericarditis may become clinically evident in patients with systemic H. influenzae infections many days after initiation of appropriate therapy. The pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities and therapy are briefly reviewed.
