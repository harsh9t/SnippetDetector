T- is a hematologic malignancy5,6,7.characterized by activating mutations in the 18 gene and alterations in the 79 ligase resulting in activation of otch signaling. lthough the importance of  activation in - is well established, the detailed molecular mechanisms mediating 1-induced transformation remain unknown. e hypothesized that 1 interacts with epigenetic modulators to control gene expression. n addition, we proposed that genetic alterations in key components of the epigenetic machinery could amplify oncogenic signals. o test this notion, we analyzed an extensive series of array comparative genomic hybridization (a. CGH) data on adult T-ALL primary samples for the presence of recurrent deletions encompassing genes involved in epigenetic regulation. This analysis revealed the presence of recurrent deletions involving genes encoding core components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). This complex is the β€�writerβ€� of a major repressive chromatin modification, Lysine 27 trimethylation on Histone 3 (H3K27me3). We found recurrent deletions encompassing the EZH210β€“12 and SUZ1213,14 loci (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Following these results we screened primary tumor DNA samples for the presence of somatic mutations affecting the core components of the PRC2 complex15. This analysis revealed the presence of truncating or missense mutations in both EZH2 (11/68) and SUZ12 (3/68). EZH2 mutations included four non-synonymous single-nucleotide substitutions, one nonsense mutation and six frameshift-creating insertions and deletions (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). SUZ12 mutations identified in T-ALL included 2 missense and 1 frameshift mutation (Fig. 1c,d). Loss of function mutations and deletions in EZH2 have been previously associated with myeloid leukemias10β€“12. In contrast, gain of function EZH2 mutations involved in B-cell lymphomas are typically single amino acid substitutions involving Y64116,17. Nonsense and frameshift mutations in EZH2 and SUZ12 in T-ALL are protototypical loss of function truncating alleles consistent with a PRC2 tumor suppressor role for these genes in T-cell transformation. Notably, 7 EZH2 and 3 SUZ12 mutations were heterozygous but also 4 out of 11 EZH2 and 1 out 3 SUZ12 mutations were homozygous18. In all 8/14 cases (6 EZH2 and 2 SUZ12 variants) with available matched bone marrow remission genomic DNA we confirmed the somatic origin of the EZH2 and SUZ12 mutations (Fig. 1a,c and Supplementary Table 1). The convergent findings of our re-sequencing effort and copy number analysis thus identified EZH2 and SUZ12 as novel tumor suppressor genes mutated and deleted in T-ALL. Overall, genetic lesions targeting EZH2 or SUZ12 were identified in 17/68 (25%) of primary T-ALL samples (Fig. 1e). The complete absence of EZH2 protein in both cases with combined deletion and mutation of the EZH2 gene examined (Fig. 1f) revealed that these loss of function mutations and suggested that inactivation of the PRC2 complex may constitute an important pathogenetic event in human T-ALL. Further targeted re-sequencing revealed that PRC2 genetic alterations were frequently (in 65% of the cases) associated with oncogenic NOTCH1 mutations (Supplementary Table 1). This frequency suggested that the two events could directly or indirectly co-operate. We analyzed the effects of PRC2 inactivation in the expression of prototypical NOTCH1 target genes such as HES1 and DTX1 in T-ALL cell lines harboring NOTCH1 mutations9,19. These experiments showed that silencing of both EZH2 and SUZ12 resulted in transcriptional upregulation of both target genes (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 2 and not shown), suggesting that loss of PRC2 could potentiate the NOTCH1 transcriptional program.

To further explore the role of the 2 complex in otch target expression and - induction/progression we aimed to dissect the epigenetic changes associated with transformation in -. hromatin mmuno. Precipitation (ChIP) studies using CUTLL1 cells15, a human T-ALL line20 characterized by a Notch1 translocation showed that NOTCH1 binding on the promoter of HES1, a canonical NOTCH1 target required for NOTCH1-induced transformation5,21 (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2), peaks at β�’50 to β�’100 bp relative to the Transcriptional Start Site (TSS) followed by enrichment of RNA Polymerase II (POL II) (Supplementary Fig. 3). No binding for NOTCH1 or POL II was observed in a NOTCH1-negative T-ALL cell line (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). Inhibition of the Notch1 signaling using a Ξ³-secretase inhibitor (Ξ³SI)20 (Supplementary Fig. 4a) abrogated NOTCH1 binding on the HES1 promoter and led to decreased levels of HES1 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c). Subsequent Ξ³SI removal restored high levels of NOTCH1, POL II and the activating mark acetylation of Lysine 9 of Histone 3 (H3K9ac) on the HES1 promoter as well as HES1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 4bβ€“e).

To further test the interplay between activation of 1 and epigenetic regulation we used a otch1--induced - animal model22, which recapitulates most of the features of human - (ig. 2a and upplementary ig. 5a-c). ost otch1-induced leukemias show a double positive () phenotype characterized by the expression of both 4 and 8 co-receptors (ig. 2b). o study the transcriptional and epigenetic changes in es1 during otch1 driven leukemogenesis we compared -sorted  otch1-transformed cells (-) to normal  thymocytes, which show low levels of otch1 and es1 activation (ig. 2b,c). canning of the murine es1 promoter revealed significant enrichment for otch1 binding in - compared to  (ig. 2e) accompanied by enrichment of ol. II on the TSS (Fig. 2f). Moreover, ChIP experiments showed enrichment of the activating acetylation of lysine 9 on H3 (H3K9ac)23 and trimethylation of lysine 4 on H3 (H3K4me3)24 (Fig. 2g,h) around the Hes1 TSS, followed by enrichment for the transcriptional elongation-associated form of Pol II (Serine 2-Phosphorylated Pol II, S2-P-Pol II) and trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone 3 (H3K36me3) on the gene body (Fig. 2i). One of the most prominent differences, however, was the loss of the repressive H3K27me3 from the Hes1 promoter in the leukemic cells that was accompanied by gain of acetylation of the same residue (Fig. 2j), an activating epigenetic mark25. Similar results were obtained for Deltex1 (Dtx1), which is also a direct Notch1 target gene (Supplementary Fig. 6), but not on the Gapdh locus, used as a control. These results demonstrated that Notch1-mediated oncogenic transformation was coupled to epigenetic changes, including the loss of the H3K27me3 histone mark from Notch target gene promoters.

To test whether the es1 behavior is part of a wider otch1 driven epigenetic reprogramming in leukemic cells, we performed whole transcriptome profiling (upplementary ables 3,4) and h. IP-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq, Supplementary Table 5) for H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27me3 (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Computational validation of Chip-Seq results showed high correlation of the biological replicates (Supplementary Fig. 7a) and consistency with gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 8,9). Enrichment analyses (Supplementary Tables 6β€“9) revealed that the regulated (and marked by modifications) genes belong in functional categories related to normal T cell differentiation and T cell transformation (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 10). Genes up-regulated in Notch1-driven leukemic cells compared to normal DP thymocytes were primarily characterized by loss of H3K27me3 (P= 6.91x10β�’22). Unexpectedly, gain of H3K9ac in these genes was much less significant (P=1.52x10β�’4) (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Tables 10,11), suggesting that loss of H3K27me3 is the most prominent epigenetic change coupled to gene activation. This in turn, provided evidence for a central role of PRC2 in T-ALL. On the contrary, down-regulated genes showed primarily loss of H3K9ac (P=2.79x10β�’19, Supplementary Tables 11,12). Most notably, the loss of H3K27me3 from the TSS region of T-ALL up-regulated transcripts was not due to lower total levels of the H3K27me3 in T-ALL (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 5). Changes in H3K4me3 seemed to have a lesser role related to context-dependent and fine-tuning regulation of gene expression (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 11). Targets of Notch1, such as Hes1, Dtx1, Pre-TCR alpha (Ptcra) and c-Myc, exhibited loss of H3K27me3, whereas the changes of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac were more subtle (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 12), suggesting a functional interaction between Notch1 and loss of H3K27me3, generally associated with decreased activity of the PRC2 complex.

To further explore the role of otch1 in driving the loss of 327me3 we performed h. IP-Seq for Notch1 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 13). Whereas no significant peaks were detected in DP, analysis of Notch1-transformed T-ALL lymphoblasts revealed a large number of direct Notch1 binding events. Importantly, H3K27me3 loss in T-ALL was broadly overlapping with direct Notch1 binding in TSS regions (Fig. 4a,b). The lack of enrichment of H3K9ac gain or loss suggested that Notch1 binding is highly specific to H3K27me3 loss (Fig. 4a). The observed loss of H3K27me3 in Notch1 targets is mainly localized in a narrow region around TSSs (Fig. 4b). Loss of H3K27me3 was observed specifically on Notch1 targets and not in the whole T-ALL genome (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs 14 and 15). These combined data suggested that significant loss of H3K27me3 is a hallmark of the oncogenic function of Notch1 in T-ALL.

The rapid increase of otch1- levels in human - lines upon ³ removal (upplementary ig. 4) resulted in a dynamic and rapid loss of the 327 (ig. 4c and upplementary ig. 16), further proving the inverse correlation of the two events. his led us to further investigate this relationship in additional human - cell lines and primary - samples. nitially we screened additional - lines (41 and ), exhibiting high 1- and 1 expression, and normal (1low) human thymocytes (ig. 4d). he levels of 327me3 were once more inversely correlated with 1 expression (ig. 4d). o exclude the possibility that these results were due to cell line artifacts, we studied primary samples whose high leukemogenic potential was evaluated using transplantation (ig. 4e and upplementary ig. 17). he primary - leukemic blasts exhibited higher levels of 1 compared to normal human thymocytes and the levels of 327me3 were inversely correlated with 1 expression (ig. 4f). hese studies demonstrated that the correlation between oncogenic 1 binding and loss of 327me3 is a universal characteristic of -.The rapid increase of Notch1-IC levels in human T-ALL lines upon Ξ³SI removal (Supplementary Fig. 4) resulted in a dynamic and rapid loss of the H3K27 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 16), further proving the inverse correlation of the two events. This led us to further investigate this relationship in additional human T-ALL cell lines and primary T-ALL samples. Initially we screened additional T-ALL lines (DND41 and CEM), exhibiting high N1-IC and HES1 expression, and normal (HES1low) human thymocytes (Fig. 4d). The levels of H3K27me3 were once more inversely correlated with HES1 expression (Fig. 4d). To exclude the possibility that these results were due to cell line artifacts, we studied primary samples whose high leukemogenic potential was evaluated using transplantation (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 17). The primary T-ALL leukemic blasts exhibited higher levels of HES1 compared to normal human thymocytes and the levels of H3K27me3 were inversely correlated with HES1 expression (Fig. 4f). These studies demonstrated that the correlation between oncogenic NOTCH1 binding and loss of H3K27me3 is a universal characteristic of T-ALL.

We then focused on the relationship between oncogenic 1 with the 2 complex. nitially, the analysis revealed that otch1 binding sites are enriched for 2 targets (4.3-fold enrichment and =8.45x10β�’110, upplementary able 9). oreover, we analyzed the effects of otch1 activation on the occupancy of otch1 target genes by the 2 catalytic subunit of 2. hese studies demonstrated that otch1 binding led to significant zh2 eviction from the es1 promoter (ig. 4g). his could not be attributed to lower 2 expression in the cancer cells (upplementary ig. 18a). h. IP analysis for SUZ12 binding yielded identical results (Fig. 4h). EZH2 eviction and H3K27 loss was not only a feature of the Notch1-IC model utilized, as identical results were obtained using β€�weakerβ€� human Notch1HD/PEST alleles in in vivo disease models (Supplementary Fig. 19). These epigenetic effects were observed even at the very early stages of the disease (Supplementary Fig. 20). Moreover, down-regulation of N1-IC levels byΞ³SI treatment, led to a marked decrease of EZH2 binding on the HES1 or DTX1 promoters (Supplementary Fig. 18). Also, the binding of JARID226,27, one of the recruiters of the PRC2 complex to DNA, on the HES1 promoter was also inversely correlated to Notch1 binding (Fig. 4i). These responses were rapid, as significant changes in Notch1 binding and PRC2 recruitment were detected as early as 30min upon Ξ³SI removal (Supplementary Fig. 21). The reverse correlation between Notch1-PRC2 binding and H3K27me3 levels was found in all T-ALL lines studied (Supplementary Fig. 22). Identical epigenetic changes were also noted when the Notch pathway was inhibited using a dominant negative form of MAML1 (Supplementary Fig. 23).

The presented mechanistic interaction between 1 and the 2 complex suggested a potential role for 2 mutations in -induced transformation, although otch-independent effects are also possible. o start addressing pathway interaction, we used a rosophila otch-driven tumor model28 to evaluate the impact of knockdown of (z) in cells that express weak activating alleles of otch (upplementary ig. 24). e were able to show that the combination of otch activation and (z) loss resulted in eye tumor overgrowth28,29 in approximately 50% of the progeny (n= 64)30. n agreement with such a notion of cooperation between otch and 2 loss we were able to show that: 2 silencing resulted in decreased apoptosis triggered by ³ inhibition of otch signaling in human - lines (upplementary ig. 25). oreover, 2 silencing increased the in vivo tumorigenic potential of - cells and led to enhanced mortality in transplantation experiments (upplementary ig. 26). hese studies suggested a striking conservation of the otch:2 pathway interaction in tumorigenesis and further established the role of the 2 complex as a tumor suppressor in -, although the exact mechanisms of function have to be detailed further. e believe that our studies offer new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of  cell leukemia31,32 as inhibitors of 327 demethylases33, alone or in combination with targeted anti-otch1 therapies, could antagonize oncogenic otch1 function and be further exploited for the treatment of -.The presented mechanistic interaction between NOTCH1 and the PRC2 complex suggested a potential role for PRC2 mutations in NOTCH-induced transformation, although Notch-independent effects are also possible. To start addressing pathway interaction, we used a Drosophila Notch-driven tumor model28 to evaluate the impact of knockdown of E(z) in cells that express weak activating alleles of Notch (Supplementary Fig. 24). We were able to show that the combination of Notch activation and E(z) loss resulted in eye tumor overgrowth28,29 in approximately 50% of the progeny (n= 64)30. In agreement with such a notion of cooperation between Notch and PRC2 loss we were able to show that: EZH2 silencing resulted in decreased apoptosis triggered by Ξ³SI inhibition of Notch signaling in human T-ALL lines (Supplementary Fig. 25). Moreover, EZH2 silencing increased the in vivo tumorigenic potential of T-ALL cells and led to enhanced mortality in transplantation experiments (Supplementary Fig. 26). These studies suggested a striking conservation of the Notch:PRC2 pathway interaction in tumorigenesis and further established the role of the PRC2 complex as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL, although the exact mechanisms of function have to be detailed further. We believe that our studies offer new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of T cell leukemia31,32 as inhibitors of H3K27 demethylases33, alone or in combination with targeted anti-Notch1 therapies, could antagonize oncogenic Notch1 function and be further exploited for the treatment of T-ALL.
