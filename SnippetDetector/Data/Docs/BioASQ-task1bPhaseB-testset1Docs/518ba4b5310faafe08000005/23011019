<abstract>
Eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant esophageal inflammation. Eosinophilic inflammation in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract is absent and several differential diagnoses for esophageal eosinophilia have to be excluded before diagnosing eosinophilic esophagitis. Most patients are male and have concomitant atopic disorders. Therapeutic options are based on drugs, diet and dilation.
