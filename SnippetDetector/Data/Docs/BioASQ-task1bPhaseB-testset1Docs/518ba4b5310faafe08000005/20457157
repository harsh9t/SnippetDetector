BACKGROUND & AIMS: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is caused by immunologic reactions to ingested/inhaled allergens. The diagnosis is considered if >or=15 eosinophils per high-powered field (eos/hpf) are detected in mucosal biopsies. Placebo-controlled studies have not been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral viscous budesonide (OVB). METHODS: Children with EoE were randomly assigned to groups that were given OVB (n=15) or placebo (n=9). Patients<5 feet and >or=5 feet tall received 1 mg and 2 mg OVB daily, respectively. All patients received lansoprazole. Duration of treatment was 3 months, followed by repeat endoscopy and biopsies. Patients were classified as responders if their peak eosinophil counts were <or=6 eos/hpf, partial responders were 7-19 eos/hpf, and nonresponders were >or=20 eos/hpf. Baseline and post-treatment symptoms and endoscopic and histologic features were scored. RESULTS: Thirteen (86.7%) children given OVB (P<.0001) and none who received placebo (P=.3) were classified as responders. Mean pre-/post-treatment peak eosinophil counts were 66.7 and 4.8 eos/hpf, respectively, in the group given OVB (P<.0001); they were 83.9 and 65.6 eos/hpf, respectively, in the group given placebo (P=.3). In the group given OVB, there were significant reductions from baseline values in proximal (P=.002), mid (P=.0003), and distal (P=.001) esophageal eosinophilia. After OVB therapy, compared with baseline, the mean symptom (P=.0007), endoscopy (P=.0005), and histology scores improved (P=.0035) significantly. CONCLUSIONS: OVB is an effective treatment of pan-esophageal disease in children with EoE. OVB improves symptoms and endoscopic and histologic features. Proton pump inhibitor single therapy did not significantly improve esophageal eosinophilia or symptoms of EoE.
