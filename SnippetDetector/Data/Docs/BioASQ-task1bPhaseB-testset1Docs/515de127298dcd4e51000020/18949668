Treatment of childhood uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a challenge for both, ophthalmologists and pediatricians. In this study, we use the tools of evidence based medicine (EBM) to analyse studies concerning disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)/ immunosuppressive drugs and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) blocking agents. Most experience among DMARD's/ immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, controlled studies in uveitis are still missing, so that treatment with MTX and all other immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) only reaches an evidence level III (expert opinion, clinical experience or descriptive study). Studies on TNFalpha-blocking agents reach an evidence level II-III, depending on the substance. In future, MTX will have to be examined in comparison to the new biological substance classes (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha-blockers) for the treatment of uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Controlled studies which have led to the approval of drugs for JIA are needed for uveitis in order to have the most effective and safe therapy for children with uveitis, who do not respond to conventional therapy with local and systemic steroids.
