PURPOSE: To identify the possible risk factors for the development of cataract requiring surgery in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Data of 53 children with JIA-associated uveitis, of whom 27 had undergone cataract extraction (CE), were obtained. The main outcome measure, the interval between the onset of uveitis and the first CE (U-CE interval), was examined in relation to clinical and ophthalmologic characteristics and treatment strategies before CE. RESULTS: A shorter U-CE interval was found for children with posterior synechia vs those without posterior synechia (hazard ratio [HR], 3.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 10.00). No significant difference was found for children in whom the uveitis was the first manifestation of JIA vs those in whom arthritis was the first manifestation of JIA (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.63 to 4.00) and children treated with periocular corticosteroid injections vs those not treated with periocular corticosteroid injections (HR, 3.23; 95% CI, 0.95 to 11.11). Children treated with methotrexate (MTX) had a longer U-CE interval than children not treated with MTX (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor for development of early cataract requiring surgery in children with JIA-associated uveitis is the presence of posterior synechia at the time of diagnosis of uveitis. However, early treatment with MTX is associated with a mean delay in the development of cataract requiring surgery of 3.5 years.
