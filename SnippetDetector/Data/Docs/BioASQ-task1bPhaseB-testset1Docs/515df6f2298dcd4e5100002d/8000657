BACKGROUND: Scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from Africa. This study was undertaken to define factors affecting outcome of blacks from South Africa with melanoma. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the management and outcome of 63 black patients with malignant melanoma treated at a major referral center during a 14 year period is presented. Data evaluated included patient demographic and clinical characteristics, stage at presentation, tumor site, histologic type, treatment, and subsequent cure. Survival curves were calculated for stage and site of disease. RESULT: The mean age at presentation of the 39 women and 24 men was 60.5 years (range of 30 to 85 years), with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The foot was the most common site of disease (45 patients). Seven patients had subungual melanoma, seven had primary mucosal lesions, and in six, the primary lesion could not be found. Thirty patients presented with stage I disease, two with stage II, 23 with stage III, and nine with disseminated metastatic disease. Acral lentiginous melanoma was the most common histogenetic type (34 patients), nodular melanoma occurred in ten patients, and superficial spreading melanoma occurred in three patients. The mean Breslow depth was 6.15 mm (range of 1 to 25 mm). Patients with localized disease were treated by wide local excision and split skin graft, while patients with melanoma in the nailbed were treated by amputation of the involved digit. Sixteen patients are alive after a mean follow-up period of 82.1 months, 44 have died after a mean of 12.7 months, and five patients have been unavailable for follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The poor prognosis in black patients in South Africa is the result of delayed presentation with thick primary lesions and advanced disease. An active education program may reduce mortality by detecting the disease earlier.
