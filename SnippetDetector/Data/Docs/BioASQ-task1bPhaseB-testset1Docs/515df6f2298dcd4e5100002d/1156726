<abstract>
Twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma occurring in the Igbos of Nigeria have been analysed. The site of predilection is the sole of the foot. This result supports the conclusion that Negroes tend to have the disease in the non-pigmented parts. Since preventive surgery has been advocated in Caucasians in whom sole melanomas are not common, it merits consideration and, if possible, implementation in the African Negro. The challenge implicit in this form of preventive oncology should be accepted by plastic surgeons, including Africans who specialized in this field abroad.
