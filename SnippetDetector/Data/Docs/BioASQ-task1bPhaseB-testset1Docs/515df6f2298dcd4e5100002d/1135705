Malignant melanoma of the skin in Blacks in formidable and sinister tumour. This study is concerned with the epidemiology of malignant melanoma, as seen in both urban and rural Black Africans. A smaller series in which follow-up on the patients was available is included. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind in which follow-up, and hence survival figures, can be quoted. Although the numbers are relatively small, they provide a valuable indication of the behaviour of melanomas in this group. The difficulties of follow-up cannot be overemphasised, and follow-up on 79 cases out of 100 could be obtained only by the employment of an able and enthusiastic Black social worker for 3 years. The first recorded survival figures in a Black population show a 3-year survival rate of only 28,4%. Prognosis is related to the size and extent of the tumour with larger and more widespread tumours faring worse than others. The incidence of malignant melanoma in Johannesburg Black was 1,2 per 100 000 and accounted for 2% of all cancers. The largest number of cases occurred in the 50- 70-year age group and there was a female preponderance. As in previous studies, the sites predominantly affected were the foot and the hand, mainly on the plantar and palmar surfaces.
