Hutchinson's melanotic freckle (lentigo maligna) is a well-known pigmented lesion, usually seen on the face of white patients. It may be associated with invasive malignant melanoma. This paper reports the incidence of this lesion in association with invasive malignant melanomas of the feet and hands of Black Africans. In Blacks, as in Whites, malignant melanoma with adjacent Hutchinson's melanotic freckle carries a considerably better prognosis than other histogenetic patterns of malignant melanoma.
