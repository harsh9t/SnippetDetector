<abstract>
A case of leptomeningeal melanoma in an African child of 7 years is presented together with a survey of pigmentation in the normal African brain. There is a direct relationship between the depth of pigment of the leptomeninges and the skin in Ugandan Africans, suggesting that similar factors operate in the control of melanocytes in these two sites.
