Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. Moreover, the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in melanocytic tumors is not known. We therefore examined 165 benign and malignant melanocytic lesions (including 118 invasive melanomas and 18 metastases collected as consecutive cases from various time periods and from two different pathology departments; the 51 nodular melanomas were randomly selected from a larger, consecutive, population-based series of nodular melanomas) with respect to alterations in the EGFR, BRAF and NRAS genes. Mutations in EGFR (exons 18-21) were not detected. EGFR protein expression was observed in a subgroup of melanomas, but without associations with clinicopathologic phenotype or prognosis. Cytoplasmic EGFR expression was, however, significantly increased from benign nevi to melanomas. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS were detected in superficial melanoma (25 and 29%, respectively), nodular melanoma (29 and 28%, respectively) and lentigo maligna melanoma (15 and 16%, respectively). In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors.
