Skin cancers, although uncommon, do occur in black Africans. Available literature on this subject from black African populations is scant, suggesting diminished interest. Eighteen cases of malignant skin tumors seen at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over 3 years (1984 to 1987) were analyzed for diagnoses, site of tumors, sex, and age. Seven patients (39%) had malignant melanomas affecting only the soles of the feet, while the same number had squamous cell carcinomas widely distributed in various parts of the body. Basal cell carcinomas were found in four (22%) patients with face lesions. Only three albinos were in the series, and all three had squamous cell carcinomas. Melanin protection against sun-induced skin cancers gives a false sense of well-being. The need for renewed interest of the subject is emphasized.
