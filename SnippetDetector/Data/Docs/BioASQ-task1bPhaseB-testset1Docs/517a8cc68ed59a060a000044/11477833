OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effects of Astragalus Membranaceus (AM) combined with taurine and/or coenzyme Q10(CoQ10) on coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) murine myocarditis. METHODS: Viral myocarditis model was created by intraperitoneal inoculation with CVB3 solution and were treated by saline, AM, taurine, CoQ10, AM + taurine, AM + CoQ10, AM + taurine + CoQ10, respectively. The mortality, ECG, CVB3-RNA in myocardium and myocardial histopathologic changes were observed. RESULTS: AM combined with taurine and CoQ10 could significantly reduce the mortality of the mice and the incidence of abnormal ECG at acute stage. CVB3-RNA was significantly reduced in AM treated group, especially in AM + taurine group. No anti-virus effect was found in CoQ10 group. All drugs could lighten myocardial histopathologic changes and the effect could be enhanced by combined treatment. CONCLUSIONS: AM, taurine and CoQ10 have some curative effects on CVB3 murine myocarditis, AM combined with taurine and CoQ10 is the best.
