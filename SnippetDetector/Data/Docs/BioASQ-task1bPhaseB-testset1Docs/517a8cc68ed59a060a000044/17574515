We report a successful case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for a 7-year-old girl with acute fulminant myocarditis, and describe the pitfalls and management of ECMO. The problem with ECMO is that it may not reduce the afterload of the left ventricle (LV), and may be associated with increased LV wall stress and deteriorating pulmonary congestion. It is important for ECMO management to find the best balance between flow support and LV afterload.
