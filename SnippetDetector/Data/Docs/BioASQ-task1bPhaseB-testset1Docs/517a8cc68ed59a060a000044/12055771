The clinical expression of acute myocarditis is variable from paucisymptomatic to fulminating forms which are usually lethal within days. The latter presentation takes the form of very acute cardiac failure. During this phase, the severity of myocardial dysfunction may be such that death ensues. However, if the patient survives, paradoxically, these forms have a better long-term prognosis with complete recovery of myocardial function being possible after the acute phase. The authors report a typical case of fulminating myocarditis with electromechanical dissociation, which recovered completely after a period of circulatory assistance. This case illustrates the rapidity of deterioration of the haemodynamic status and the importance of organ dysfunction despite early management. In a review of the literature, the authors found about 150 reported cases of acute myocarditis treated with circulatory assistance. In the best series, about half the patients were weaned off the circulatory assistance without having to undergo cardiac transplantation. However, the potential recovery of myocardial function is difficult to predict.
