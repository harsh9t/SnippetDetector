Aligning hundreds of sequences using progressive alignment tools such as ClustalW requires several hours on state-of-the-art workstations. We present a new approach to compute multiple sequence alignments in far shorter time using reconfigurable hardware. This results in an implementation of ClustalW with significant runtime savings on a standard off-the-shelf FPGA.
