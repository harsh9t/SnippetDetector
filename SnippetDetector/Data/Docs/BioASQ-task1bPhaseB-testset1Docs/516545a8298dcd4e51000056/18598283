Routine screening for maternal immunization in a 36-year-old woman revealed an alloimmunization against the high-incidence Vel antigen during a second pregnancy. Because of the development of immunoglobulin G-type anti-Vel, the infant developed haemolytic disease of the newborn, with severe jaundice and reticulocytosis. Phototherapy was needed to reduce hyperbilirubinaemia.
