As reported by other authors we can confirm that the frequency of the blood group Vel negative in Lower Saxony is 1:4000. We report on a patient whose serological characteristics (IgM- and IgA-anti-Vel) made the transfusion of Vel positive blood impossible. Since it was not possible to obtain sufficient Vel negative red cell units in time, the patient was convinced to donate blood for autologous transfusions. This should be the procedure of first choice in the transfusion management of such patients.
