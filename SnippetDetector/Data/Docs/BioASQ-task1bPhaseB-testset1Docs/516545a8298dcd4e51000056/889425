The principle of detecting red cell antibodies by automated technique using the two-channel Technicon Auto-Analyser with some modification is described. The sensitivity of automated methods in detecting antibodies of different specificities was determined. The study was carried out with 76 diagnostic human sera produced by the Institute of Hematology, Transfusion Centers and commercial firms: anti-RhD, -C, -E, -CW, -c, -e, anti-K, -k, Kpa, anti-Fya, -Fyb, anti-Jka, -Jkb, anti-M, -S, -s, anti-P1, anti-Lua, anti-Lea, -Leb, anti-H, -A1, anti-I, anti-Lua and anti-Vel. A majority of the antibodies were detected by both automated methods with greater sensitivity than by manual methods. Greatest sensitivity was observed in the detection of anti-S, -Vel and antibodies of the Rh system. Anti-Leb and anti A1 antibodies were not detected. The studies are the basis for introduction of the automated technique into routine use for antibodies in blood donors and recipients.
