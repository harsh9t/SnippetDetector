The polybren test (P) was used parallelly with the antiglobulin test (PTA-LISS) and enzymatic test (LEN) for detection of HIV-1 antibodies. The analysis of the results of testing of 646 sera showed that the P test is a simple method making possible detection of most antibodies of the IgG class without using antiglobulin serum within up to 3 minutes. The sensitivity of the P test was high. The sera with antibodies to the antigens of the systems Rh, Kidd, Duffy, MNSs and other less frequent antibodies such as anti-Vel, anti-Coa anti-Co(b), anti-Dia and anti-Ge showed the highest activity in the P test. In one serum anti-D antibodies, in three sera anti-C and in one serum anti-Ge antibodies were detected only in the P test, while no reactions were obtained in the PTA-LISS and LEN tests. Among the immune antibodies the exception was the antibody to Kell antigens which weakly reacted in the P test and in most cases an additional phase of testing with antiglobulin PTA-P was necessary for its demonstration. The P test was of low usefulness in the detection of cold IgM antibodies such as anti-Le, anti-Fe1, anti-I and anti-HI.
