A non-transfused, 43 year old Caucasian female presented with acute haemolytic anaemia and splenomegaly. Sections of bone marrow showed erythroid hyperplasia. The patient's red blood cells gave a negative reaction with polyspecific antiglobulin serum, but a positive reaction with specific anti-IgM. A heat eluate prepared from her red cells showed anti-Vel specificity. Her serum agglutinated only Vel-positive cells including her own. All papain pre-treated red cells including her own and Vel-negative cells were completely haemolysed at 37 degrees C. The percentage of haemolysis of Vel-positive cells was greater than that of Vel-negative cells.
