Autistic behavior is often accompanied by numerous disturbing symptoms on the part of gastrointestinal system, such as abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea. These problems are often connected with deregulation of physiological microflora in intestine. The aim of this study was to determine differences in intestinal microflora of autistic and healthy children. Strains of Clostridium spp. and enterococci were isolated more frequently from stool samples of autistic children and rarely lactobacilli. Quantitative differences were observed maliny among staphylococci, Candida spp. and Clostridium perfringens. Monitoring and stabilization of intestinal microflora and knowledge about role of particular strains in etiology of autistic disorders can increase the chances for appropriate therapy.
