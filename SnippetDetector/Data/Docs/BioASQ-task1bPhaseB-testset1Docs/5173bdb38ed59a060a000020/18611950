p73 is a member of the p53 family of transcription factors, existing as numerous 2- and -terminal isoforms (1,2) he 2-terminal variant, known as the delta. Np73 (DNp73), is generated from an internal intronic promoter and lacks the NH2-terminal transactivation (TA) domain, and hence, has been suggested to bind to and counter the tumour-suppressive properties of the TA proficient full-length TAp73 forms (3,4). However, some reports have suggested that DNp73 have some ability to transactivate target genes due to the presence of a second TA domain, which includes the PxxP motif (5). The COOH-terminal variants arise due to alternate splicing resulting in multiple isoforms that exhibit varying degrees of TApotential (6,7). The longest isoform, the TAp73Ξ±, generally shows weaker activity than TAp73Ξ² and TAp73Ξ³ that exhibit stronger TA potential (7,8). Hitherto, it has been classically thought that the TAp73 forms primarily function as tumour suppressors, albeit weaker than p53 itself, whereas the DNp73 forms act as oncogenes, as has been demonstrated by genetic, over-expression and other in vitro studies (3,9,10).
However, clinical reports analysing p73 expression profile have highlighted a complicating scenario. Not only are the DNp73 forms over-expressed as expected, but also the TAp73 forms are over-expressed in a multitude of human cancers (6,11β€“17). It was shown that one-third of tumours that over-express DNp73 forms also exhibited concomitant up-regulation of the antagonistic TAp73 (12). Although co-over-expression of DNp73 with TAp73 may nullify the tumour-suppressive properties of the latter in human tumours, it is still unclear why there is a need for TAp73 forms to be over-expressed at all. Recent data from others and us have provided evidence for a role for TAp73 in supporting cellular growth, and hence, in tumour development. Ectopic expression of TAp73 was shown to support cellular survival under defined conditions, and conversely, absence of p73 led to reduced proliferation, through the regulation of AP-1 activity (18). Consistently, TAp73 expression was also found to lead to the activation of the promoter of gastrin, a peptide hormone that is important in determining the progression of a number of human malignancies, and a strong correlation was noted between gastrin and TAp73 levels in gastric cancers (19). In addition, over-expression of both TAp73 and DNp73 seen in upper gastrointestinal carcinomas correlated with TCF-dependent transcriptional activation and the up-regulation of Ξ²-catenin in gastrointestinal cells, implying a tumour-promoting role for combined expression of TAp73 and DNp73 (20). Finally, TAp73 was seen to negate p53-mediated suppression of human telomerase expression, suggesting a contributory role for TAp73 in carcinogenesis (21). These data therefore suggest that TAp73 forms may support cellular survival, besides their classical roles as tumour suppressors, though the exact context in which these properties are exhibited is unclear.
Nevertheless, as with p53, p73 forms have also been shown to regulate apoptosis, a critical process suppressing tumourigenesis. TAp73 has been shown to induce the expression of genes like puma and scotin amongst others (22), and absence of the anti-apoptotic DNp73 was shown to lead to massive apoptosis in the developing mouse brain (23). However, whether the core component of the apoptotic machineryβ€”the proteolytic system involving a family of proteases known as caspases (24)β€”is regulated by p73 members is unclear. There are 14 members in the caspase family, which can be generally grouped into two main groups according to their functions: those involved in cytokine processing (caspase-1, -4, -5, -11 to -14) and those in apoptosis (caspase-2, -3, -6 to -10) (25). Of the apoptotic caspases studied, the function and regulation of caspase-2, -8 and -9 have been the best characterized. Of these, caspase-2 is interesting as it exists as two distinct isoforms with opposing functions: the long caspase-2L form induces cell death, while the short caspase-2S isoform inhibits cell death upon over-expression (26,27). The dominant caspase-2L form is expressed in most tissues, whereas caspase-2S is preferentially expressed in brain and skeletal muscles (27). The two mRNAs differ at their 5β€²-end, suggesting the existence of distinct transcriptional start sites (28). The 5β€² RTβ€“RACE and RNase protection assays showed that the main transcription start site of caspase-2S differs from the transcription start site of caspase-2L. Caspase-2S transcription initiates within intron 1 of the caspase-2 gene and the presence of a TATA box in caspase-2S promoter suggest that under specific conditions, caspase-2S expression can be up-regulated (28). In addition, caspase-2S isoform is produced by the insertion of a 61-bp exon at the 3β€²-end of the caspase-2 pre-mRNA, which introduces a premature stop codon (27).
Since TAp73 appears to regulate both apoptosis and also support cellular survival, we explored the possibility that it would differentially regulate caspase expression. Interestingly, we found that both TA73Ξ² and DN73Ξ² isoforms were able to induce the expression of caspase-2S, but not of the other caspases tested. This induction is dependent on a unique 18-bp p73Ξ²-recognition sequence on the caspase-2S promoter to which both TA73Ξ² and DN73Ξ² bind directly in vivo and in vitro. Consistently, over-expression of DN73Ξ² in neuroblastoma cells led to elevated levels of caspase-2S expression and these cells were resistant to cell death induced by several means. The data together identify caspase-2S as a novel target of both TA73Ξ² and DN73Ξ² isoforms, suggesting a role for them in promoting cellular survival.

ells, plasmids and transfections. The p53 null H1299 cells and Saos-2 cells inducibly expressing TAp73Ξ² have been described (18). SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were transfected with pcDNA or DNp73Ξ² and selected on G418 to generate stable transfectants. Saos2-TAp73Ξ² inducible cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% tetracycline free FBS, and TAp73Ξ² was induced by addition of 2 ΞΌM doxocycline prior to harvesting at the indicated time points.The 2 Γ— 105 cells (in 6-well dishes) were used for transfection experiments using Lipofectamine PLUS-Reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). H1299 cells were transiently transfected with various plasmids, and collected 36 or 24 h later for RTβ€“PCR or luciferase analysis, respectively. siRNA was transfected at 3 ΞΌg per well using RNAifect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), as per manufacturer's protocols.The pCDNA3-based expression plasmids for p53, TAp63Ξ±, TAp63Ξ², TAp73Ξ±, TAp73Ξ², TAp73Ξ²-292, DNp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ²-292 have been described (21).

The Sp-1 cDNA was a gift from Dr Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkerly, USA) (29). PCM2, Del1, Del2, Del3 and Del4 caspase-2 promoter-luciferase constructs have been described (28). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as per manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using the Del4 promoter to generate Del4 truncations Del4.1, Del4.2 and Del4.3 by PCR cloning, using primers as follows: Del4.1-for: 5β€²AAAAGGTACCAGCCTGACTCCGCGCAAGG3β€², Del4.2-for: 5β€²AAAAGGTACCTCCTTATGAGGGAAACTATAA3β€², Del4.3-for: 5β€²AAAAGGTACCGTCTCTCGTGGGAAAAGACTGGC3β€² and a common reverse primer Del4-rev: 5β€²ACTTAGATCGCAGATCTCGAGTCGATAC3β€². Sp-1 siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and p73 and the control siRNA were purchased from Qiagen. The sequence of p73 siRNA is as follows: 5β€²- - - AAGGCAATAATCTCTCGCAGT - - -3β€², and targets both TAp73 and DNp73 forms.Cell death assaysSH-SY5Y cells stably expressing pCDNA or DNp73Ξ² were seeded in triplicates in 6-well plates and serum-starved in serum-free DMEM for indicated time periods before harvesting for sub-G1 analysis. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight, washed twice with cold PBS, treated with RNase A for 20 min before addition of 5 ΞΌg/ml PI and analysed by BD Biosciences FACScalibur (Mountain View, CA, USA). Similarly, cells were treated with 20 ΞΌM cisplatin for 24 h or serum-starved for 48 h, and analysed for cell viability by their ability to exclude propidium iodide, by flow cytometry. For siRNA experiments, siRNA was transfected 24 h prior to serum-starvation for a further 48 h before analysis of cell death.Luciferase assaysH1299 cells were transiently transfected with 0.2 ΞΌg of the various plasmids along with indicated caspase-2 promoterβ€“reporter constructs and Ξ²-galactosidase construct to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed as described (21).RNA analysisTotal RNA was prepared from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's instructions. Semi-quantitative RTβ€“PCR was performed using TAp73 (32 cycles), TAp63 (30), caspase-2L (33), caspase-2S (33), caspase-8 (30), caspase-9 (30), MDM2 (30), DNp73 (34) and gapdh (22) primers, under the following conditions: 94Β°C for 3 min, followed by cycling at 94Β°C for 50 s, 52Β°C for 50 s and 72Β°C for 1 min.

Treated cells were then washed twice with PBS and once with KM buffer (pH 6.8, 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MOPS), at 10 min interval. Cells were then lysed for 30 min using 4 ml KM buffer + 1% NP40 + protease inhibitors at 4Β°C and further incubated in 2.7 ml 5 M NaCl for 60 min at 4Β°C. Lysates were collected with TE buffer and sonicated with VCX130PB (Jencons, Bridgeville, PA, USA) five times for 10 s each, with about 10 min intervals on ice, centrifuged at 13 000 r.p.m. at 4Β°C for 30 min and supernatant was collected. A total of 400 ΞΌl of supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with 10 ΞΌl of anti-p73 (ER15) or anti-HA (Santa Cruz) antibodies for 2 h at 4Β°C. 1 ΞΌl of DynabeadsΒ® Protein A and G (Invitrogen) were added for a further 2 h. Immune complexes were then washed with 2 Γ— RIPA buffer, 1 Γ— HS buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl), 1 Γ— LS buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl), 1 Γ— 0.25 M LiCl buffer, 1 Γ— 0.5 M LiCl buffer at 37Β°C for 10 min, followed by 2Γ— RIPA buffer, 2Γ— TE buffer. DNA/protein complex was eluted with 100 ΞΌl of TE buffer containing 1% SDS and was then reverse cross-linked by 200 mM NaCl at 65Β°C for 4 h, followed by proteinase K treatment (500 ΞΌg/ml) at 55Β°C for 2 h. DNA fragments were isolated using Qiagen PCR purification kit. PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Qiagen) in a 50 ΞΌl solution as follows: 5 ΞΌl of DNA, 1 ΞΌl each of 10 pmol/ΞΌl of primers, 1 ΞΌl of 10 mM dNTPs, 5 ΞΌl of 10 Γ— buffer and 0.4 ΞΌl of Taq polymerase.

These plasmids were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli and cultured in 200 ml LB broth for 4β€“5 h, until OD600 = 0.5. 1 mM of IPTG was then added to the cultures and further cultured at 37Β°C for 4 h. The cultures were harvested and washed in PBS, and then lysed by sonication at rating 3, 30 s pulse, 30 s interval, 10Γ— and the lysate was collected by centrifugation. The lysates were incubated with gluthatione beads for 2 h at 4Β°C. The beads were then washed several times in PBS and bound GST fusion proteins eluted with glutathione elution buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 5 mM glutathione). A 18 bp TAp73Ξ² recognition site on caspase-2S promoter containing oligonucleotides, 5β€²GAC GCC CGC CCG AGC CGC TCC GAG3β€², was synthesized with 5β€² biotin label on both strands. The biotin-labelled recognition sequence was then attached to avidin-conjugated sepharose beads (Invitrogen). Purified GST proteins diluted in RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl) were then incubated with the recognition sequence attached beads for 2 h at 4Β°C. After incubation, the mix was washed six times with RIPA buffer. After the last wash, 30 ΞΌl of protein loading buffer was added to the beads and boiled for 5 min before loading onto SDSβ€“acrylamide gel for separation.

p73², but not p73±, p53 or p63, induces caspase-2 expression. We first evaluated if p73 can transcriptionally regulate any of the initiator caspases. TAp73Ξ² was ectopically expressed in p53 null H1299 cells and the levels of caspase-2, -8 and -9 mRNA were determined by semi-quantitative RTβ€“PCR. Although none of the full-length initiator caspases were up-regulated by TAp73Ξ² over-expression, the short isoform of the caspase-2, caspase-2S, was significantly up-regulated (Figure 1A). Unfortunately, we were unable to detect endogenous caspase-2S protein levels, as it is generated from a short-lived mRNA and hence, not easily detectable under these conditions (data not shown) (30). Nonetheless, we evaluated if this increase in caspase-2S was specific to TAp73Ξ² over-expression by expressing the other p53 family members. Surprisingly, we found that only TAp73Ξ², but not p53, TAp73Ξ±, TAp63Ξ± or TAp63Ξ² was able to induce the expression of caspase-2S (Figure 1B). It is noteworthy that TAp73Ξ± and both TAp63Ξ± or TAp63Ξ² were unable to activate caspase-2S, though they were capable of activating Mdm2, suggesting that this induction is specific to the TAp73Ξ² form of TAp73.
Figure 1.TAp73Ξ², but not p53, TAp73Ξ±, TAp63Ξ± or TAp63Ξ², induce caspase-2S expression. (A) TAp73Ξ² expression induces the up-regulation of caspase-2S but not other caspase transcripts. The pcDNA and TAp73 expression constructs were transfected into H1299 cells for 36 h before RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Semi-quantitative RTβ€“PCR was performed for caspase-2L, caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-2S transcripts. (B) The pcDNA, p53, TAp63Ξ±, TAp63Ξ², TAp73Ξ± and TAp73Ξ² expression constructs were transfected into H1299 cells similarly and expression of caspase-2L and caspase-2S transcripts were analysed. Mdm2 was used as a positive control and the expression of the transfected p53 family members is shown.Both TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² activate the caspase-2S promoterAs TAp73Ξ² expression led to an increase in the steady-state levels of caspase-2S mRNA, we ascertained if this was due to transcriptional activation of the caspase-2S promoter. To this end, we utilized several caspase-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs described in our earlier study, which revealed that caspase-2S can be transcribed from an alternate promoter within intron 1 of the caspase-2 gene (28) (Figure 2A, left panel). Expectedly, TAp73Ξ² expression led to a significant increase in the reporter activity from the construct containing only caspase-2S promoter located within intron 1 (Del 4), but not from the construct containing full-length caspase-2L promoter (PCM2) (Figure 2A, right panel). TAp73Ξ² was also unable to effectively activate luciferase activity from the sequentially deleted promoter constructs containing the caspase-2L exon 1 and intron 1 (Del 1, Del 2 and Del 3) (28), despite all of them containing the caspase-2S promoter located in intron 1 (Figure 2A, right panel). This suggests that there may be negative regulatory elements in exon 1, preventing TAp73Ξ²-mediated caspase-2 activation. Nonetheless, these data confirms our initial finding that TAp73Ξ² induces caspase-2s expression by transcriptionally activating its promoter.
Figure 2.Activation of caspase-2S promoter by TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ². (A) Left panel shows the schematic of the caspase-2S promoter-luciferase constructs used in the study. Curved arrows represent the TATA box. Exon 1 of caspase-2S and caspase-2L are shown. These constructs were transfected together with TAp73Ξ² and Ξ²-gal plasmid into H1299 cells for 24 h. The cultures were then lysed and used for luciferase assays (right panel). (B) Activation of Del 4 reporter construct is specific only to TAp73Ξ². The indicated reporter constructs were transfected together with either of the following: p53, TAp63Ξ±, TAp63Ξ², TAp73Ξ± and TAp73Ξ², together with the Ξ²-gal plasmid into H1299 cells for 24 h, prior to analysis of luciferase activity (left panel). Right panel shows immunoblot analysis of the expression of the transfected plasmids. (C) DNA-binding ability of p73Ξ² is essential for induction of Del4 promoter. Del4 reporter constructs were transfected together with either TAp73Ξ² or TAp73Ξ²-292, or DNp73Ξ² or DNp73Ξ²-292 together with Ξ²-gal plasmid into H1299 cells, prior to analysis of luciferase activity (left panel). Right panel shows immunoblot analysis of the expression of the transfected plasmids. All luciferase assays were repeated at least thrice, each time in duplicates. The graphs are representation of average Β± SED.Analysis using the other p53 family members confirmed our earlier RTβ€“PCR data that only TAp73Ξ², but not p53, TAp63Ξ± or TAp63Ξ² is able to effectively activate the caspase-2 promoter (Del4), though all proteins were approximately equally expressed (Figure 2B). Next, we evaluated if the DNA-binding ability and TA domain of TAp73Ξ² are required to activate the Del4 reporter construct by utilizing the TAp73Ξ²-R292H, which has a point mutation in the DNA-binding domain and hence, defective in its ability to specifically bind DNA, and the DNp73Ξ² that lacks the TA domain. This analysis revealed that the DNA-binding ability of TAp73Ξ² is essential to activate caspase-2S promoter, as the TAp73Ξ²-R292H mutant was almost completely defective in transactivation, though being expressed efficiently (Figure 2C). However, unexpectedly, we found that DNp73Ξ² without the TA domain was able to transactivate the caspase-2S promoter, and mutation in the DNA-binding domain of DNp73Ξ² abrogated this effect (Figure 2C). These results together indicate that TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² are specifically capable of transcriptionally activating the caspase-2S promoter, though the NH2-terminal TA domain is dispensable for this process.A unique element in the caspase-2S promoter is required for activation by p73Ξ²We next characterized the caspase-2S promoter to define the minimal DNA sequence required for activation, by making sequential deletions of the Del 4 construct (Figure 3A). We made the assumption that the essential site should lie upstream of the TATA box (Supplementary Figure 1A, indicated in bold), and hence, made deletions starting from the 5β€²-end of Del4 towards the 3β€²-end till prior to the TATA box (Figures 3A and Supplementary Figure 1A). These constructs, termed Del 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, were co-transfected together with TAp73Ξ² to analyse their activity. Surprisingly, TAp73Ξ² was unable to activate any of these deletions constructs, when compared to the parent Del4 promoter (Figure 3B), suggesting that the site that is required for TAp73Ξ² to activate the caspase-2S promoter probably lies upstream of Del 4.1. The fragment between Del 4 and Del 4.1 is only about 18-bp long and contains a GC-rich box to which the Sp-1 transcription factor could potentially bind (31) (Supplementary Figure 1B). To test if the Sp-1-binding site is required for TAp73Ξ²-mediated activation, we generated a mutant construct in which the Sp-1 site was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (Supplementary Figure 1B). Luciferase assays indicted that though there was a slight decrease in total activity, TAp73Ξ² was still capable of consistently activating the Del4-Sp-1 mutant construct, and the fold of activation of the promoterβ€“luciferase activity was significant for both the wild-type and Sp-1-mutant promoters (Del4 versus Sp-1-mut: 83.0 versus 62.0) (Figure 3C, left panel). To evaluate if Sp-1 would affect TAp73Ξ²-mediated caspase-2S promoter activation, we co-transfected Sp-1 cDNA with TAp73Ξ² cDNA. Expression of Sp-1 alone led to a marginal activation of the caspase-2S promoter, and this effect was abrogated when the Sp-1 site was mutated (Del4 versus Sp-1-mut: 8.0 versus 3.0) (Figure 3C, left panel). Co-expression of TAp73Ξ² with Sp-1 resulted in a decrease in the TA potential compared to when TAp73Ξ² was expressed alone (Del4 versus Sp-1-mut: 40.0 versus 44.0) (Figure 3C, left panel). Nonetheless, the combined effect of TAp73Ξ² and Sp-1 was not affected by mutation of the Sp-1-binding site. Immunoblot analysis indicated that both the levels of Sp-1 and TAp73 were consistently reduced when co-expressed, suggesting other inter-regulation between them (Figure 3C, right panel). These data together suggest that the Sp-1-binding site may not be crucial for p73 to activate caspase-2S, and that Sp-1 may not have a significant role in regulating TAp73Ξ²-mediated caspase-2S promoter activation.
Figure 3.Characterization of DNA elements required for activation of caspase-2S promoter by p73. (A) Schematic shows the deletion constructs made sequentially using Del 4. (B) The sequentially truncated Del4 constructs were transfected together with TAp73Ξ² and Ξ²-gal into H1299 cells for 24 h, prior to luciferase analysis. (C) Del4 and Del4-Sp-1 mutant reporter constructs were transfected together with TAp73Ξ² or Sp-1, alone or in combination, into H1299 cells for luciferase analysis. The fold induction of luciferase activity was derived by dividing the values obtained with the respective constructs with that of pcDNA-transfected samples. Right panel shows immunoblot analysis of the expression of the transfected plasmids. (D) Knockdown of Sp-1 does not significantly affect the activation of Del4 promoter by TAp73Ξ². Control or Sp-1 siRNA were transfected into H1299 for 24 h prior to transfection of the Del4, TAp73Ξ² and Ξ²-gal constructs for luciferase analysis. Fold induction of luciferase activity is shown. Right panel shows efficiency of Sp-1 knockdown by immunoblotting. All luciferase assays were repeated at least thrice, each time in duplicates. The graphs are representation of average Β± SED.To further determine if Sp-1 is required for TAp73Ξ²-dependent activation of the caspase-2S promoter, we silenced its expression using Sp-1-specific siRNA 24 h prior to luciferase assays using the Del4 construct. As seen in Figure 3D, silencing of Sp-1 expression did not affect the induction of Del4 activity by TAp73Ξ², and the ratio of activation was comparable between control and Sp-1 siRNA treatment (control versus Sp-1 siRNA: 26.5 versus 33.5). These results therefore together suggest that the 18-bp element within the GC-rich box in caspase-2S promoter is required for TAp73Ξ²-mediated expression, which is probably independent of Sp-1.TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² bind to the unique site in vitro and in vivoSince both TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² activated the caspase-2S promoter through their DNA-binding domains, we tested if they can directly bind to the 18-bp element identified as being important for caspase-2S promoter activation by TAp73Ξ². In the first instance, in vitro DNA-binding assays were performed using bacterially purified GST-TAp73Ξ², GST-TAp73Ξ±, GST-DN73Ξ² and GST-p53, and a biotin-labeled 24-bp oligonucleotide encompassing the 18-bp element. Incubation of GST proteins and oligonucleotides together with avidin-conjugated agarose beads, followed by washing to remove excess unbound proteins and subsequent immunoblotting revealed that only TAp73Ξ² and DN73Ξ², but not TAp73Ξ± or p53, could bind to the beads containing the 18-bp DNA sequence (Figure 4A, compare lanes 1 to 3). This binding, though weak, was reproducible. To confirm this result, we attempted to detect endogenous binding of TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² to the caspase-2S promoter in vivo, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We used two cell lines for this purpose: the Saos2-TAp73Ξ² inducible cells and the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line stably expressing DNp73Ξ². The caspase-2S mRNA expression was up-regulated upon TAp73Ξ² induction in Saos2-TAp73Ξ² cells and was higher in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing DNp73Ξ² compared to their pcDNA-expressing control counterparts (Figure 4B and C). There were no differences in the levels of caspase-2L in both cases (Figure 4B and C). Immunoprecipitation with anti-p73 or the irrelevant anti-HA antibodies was followed by PCR amplification of the region flanking the 18-bp site on the caspase-2S promoter (indicated as Casp-2S) or an irrelevant site away from this region. As shown in Figure 4D, strong and specific binding of TAp73 was noted on the region surrounding the 18-bp element but not on the non-specific site in Saos2-TAp73Ξ² cells. Both these sites were amplifiable from crude lysates prior to immunoprecipitation, indicating the presence of these DNA fragments in the lysates (input). Similarly, ChIP analysis using the SH-SY5Y cells indicated a PCR product amplified specifically in DNp73Ξ²-expressing cells and not in pcDNA cells with the anti-p73 antibody, which was also not significantly present in anti-HA immunoprecipitates (Figure 4E, upper panel). No PCR product was amplified from the non-specific site on the caspase-2S promoter (Figure 4E, lower panel). These data together suggest that TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² can bind to the caspase-2S promoter containing the 18-bp site identified by the luciferase assays, both in vitro and in vivo, and highlight that the lack of the TA domain does not affect the binding of DNp73Ξ² to DNA sequences.

Purified GST-TAp73Ξ± GST-TAp73Ξ² GST-DNp73Ξ² or GST-p53 proteins were incubated with biotinylated 18 bp caspase-2S promoter containing sequence elements before further incubation with avidin-conjugated beads. GST-p73/p53 without biotinylated DNA but with beads alone was used as negative controls. The beads were washed and separated onto SDSβ€“acrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Lane1: GST-protein + 18-bp element + beads. Lane 2: GST-protein + beads.

TAp73Ξ² was induced by doxocycline (Dox) addition for 14β€“24 h prior to RNA extraction. RTβ€“PCR was performed to assess expression of caspase-2S, caspase-2L, p73 and mdm2 in both the cell systems. (D and E) ChIP analysis was performed with anti-p73 and anti-HA antibodies using the two cellular systems described earlier. Cells were collected 15 h after TAp73 induction (D). The promoter sequence encompassing the 18-bp elements on the caspase-2S promoter was analysed by PCR (Casp2S). A non-specific site on the caspase-2S promoter was used as negative control. All experiments were repeated at least thrice independently.Over-expression of DNp73Ξ² protects cells from cell death through caspase-2S activationOver-expression of caspase-2S has been shown to protect cells from cell death induced by serum deprivation (27). Hence, we tested if the SH-SY5Y-DNp73Ξ² cells, which express higher levels of caspase-2S mRNA, are also more resistant to serum deprivation-induced cell death. Serum deprivation of both SH-SY5Y-pcDNA and SH-SY5Y-DNp73Ξ² cells followed by analysis of DNA content to monitor the sub-G1 populationβ€”which reflects apoptotic cellsβ€”indicated that there was less cell death in the SH-SY5Y-DNp73Ξ² cells (% sub-G1 cells β†’ pcDNA versus DNp73Ξ² cells: 28.9 versus 16.0 [day2]; 31.0 versus 20.0 [day3]) (Figure 5A and B). Similarly, though treatment with another cellular insult, cisplatin, resulted in an increase in cell death of pcDNA cells, there was no significant death in DNp73Ξ² cells (% dead cells β†’ β�’/+ cisplatinβ€”pcDNA versus DNp73Ξ² cells: 8.0/20.0 versus 5.0/4.8) (Figure 5C).

(A and B) SH-SY5Y cells stably over-expressing pcDNA or DNp73Ξ² were seeded in 6-well plates in triplicates and serum starved in serum free DMEM for up to 72 h. Cultures were harvested at days 0, 1, 2 and 3 during serum starvation for cell cycle analysis. Representative flow cytometric graphics (A). Average of the sub-G1 population, representing apoptotic cells, for each cell line and time point is plotted Β± SED (B). (C) These cells were treated with 20 ΞΌM cisplatin for 24 h prior to analysis of total cell death by propidium iodide exclusion assay. (D and E) Knockdown of p73 results in reduced caspase-2S expression and increased cell death. The above cells were transfected with control or p73-siRNA and serum-starved for the indicated time periods. The mRNA analysis was performed to determine expression of caspase-2S, DNp73 and gapdh (D), and cells were harvested after 48 h for analysis of cell death by propidium iodide exclusion assay (E). All experiments were repeated at least thrice independently.In order to verify if the resistance to cell death is due to DNp73Ξ²-mediated caspase-2S activation, we silenced the expression of the over-expressed DNp73Ξ² using p73-specific siRNA, followed by serum-starvation for up to 48 h. Silencing of p73 resulted in a decrease in the DNp73Ξ² levels, as expected (Figure 5D). Importantly, the levels of caspase-2S were also reduced concomitantly (Figure 5D), indicating that DNp73Ξ² is indeed responsible for caspase-2S activation. Analysis of cell death revealed that silencing DNp73Ξ² expression consistently led to an increase in cell death, compared to control siRNA treated cells (% dead cells upon serum-starvation: SH-SY5Y-pCDNA cellsβ€“20.0; SH-SY5Y-DNp73Ξ² cellsβ€”control versus p73 siRNA: 11.0 versus 16.5) (Figure 5E). These data together indicate that expression of DNp73Ξ², which leads to up-regulation of caspase-2S, contributes to protection of cells against cell death induced by multiple means.

he findings presented here highlight two salient points: that the tumour-suppressor p73² is able to induce the expression of the anti-apoptotic caspase-2, and that p73², without the 2-terminal  domain, is also capable of activating caspase-2 expression. he former finding, though at first instance perplexing, is entirely compatible with the emerging view that p73² may have other roles in supporting cellular growth. he latter finding highlight the fact that some targets can be common to both p73² and p73², and hence, may explain why many human tumours co-over-express both p73 and p73 to provide a strong survival pressure.
t is striking that expression of the tumour-suppressor p73², which induces cell death when over-expressed in many cellular systems, is able to transactivate the anti-apoptotic capase-2 gene. hough loss of all p73 forms result in increased resistance to cell death (9,32), p73 is over-expressed in many human cancers (6,11β€“17). ntriguingly, it is to be noted that physiologically, p73² transcripts are not readily detectable (33). hese mitigating reasons raise the interesting possibility that p73² may have evolved to also support cellular survival under certain conditions, such as seen in human cancers. n support of this, we have recently shown that expression of p73 can cooperate with c-un to activate -1 target genes such as cyclin. D1, and hence, promote cellular survival (18). Moreover, absence of p73 led to reduced expression of cyclinD1 and decreased cellular proliferation. In addition, other groups have also raised the possibility that TAp73 may be involved in the activation of genes that are involved in tumourigenesis, such as Ξ²-catenin and gastrin (19,20). Thus, these findings together favour the argument for a contributory role of TAp73 in supporting cellular survival, in one way by activating the expression of capase-2S as demonstrated here.
In addition, DNp73Ξ² is the variant of p73 that is predominantly expressed in the brain and sympathetic neurons (23). The p73β�’/β�’ mice display severe defects in their nervous system including massive cell death, suggesting that DNp73Ξ² plays an anti-apoptotic role in the brain (33). Over-expression of DNp73Ξ² in sympathetic neurons was also able to rescue cell death resulting from nerve growth factor withdrawal (34). Similarly, caspase-2S is highly expressed in the brain and caspase-2S has been shown to protect cells from cell death induced by several means (27,35). Therefore, our results that the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably over-expressing DNp73Ξ²β€”which express higher level of caspase-2S compared with pcDNA expressing control cellsβ€”are resistant to cell death upon serum starvation and cisplatin treatment are entirely consistent with a protective role for DNp73Ξ² in some cellular contexts. Importantly, reducing the exogenously expressed DNp73Ξ² levels by gene silencing led to a decrease in caspase-2S expression and a concomitant reversal of resistance to cell death, suggesting that the activation of caspase-2S by DNp73Ξ² indeed leads to protection against cell death. However, we have not been able to specifically silence the expression of caspase-2S in DNp73Ξ²-over-expressing cells to demonstrate its relevance due to the sequence similarity of caspase-2S and caspase-2L (data not shown). Nonetheless, our data suggest that physiologically, DNp73Ξ² may act through caspase-2S to protect neuronal cells from cell death.
Activation of caspase-2S was found to be specific to the p73 family, but not to p53, TAp63Ξ± and TAp63Ξ² though all three p53 family members share similar DNA-binding domains and are thought to be able to activate a large subset of p53 target genes (6,36). However, the specificity of the p73 family could arise due to subtle differences elsewhere, which may be more critical for binding to the unique site on the caspase-2S promoter, besides the common DNA-binding domain. However, this cannot explain why TAp73Ξ±, which also share the same DNA-binding and other domains as TAp73Ξ², and is over-expressed in human cancers as TAp73Ξ², cannot induce caspase-2S expression. The sterile Ξ±-domain present in TAp73Ξ± but not in TAp73Ξ² has been shown to play an inhibitory role in TA, making TAp73Ξ± a weaker transactivator of target genes compared to TAp73Ξ² (37,38). This could be a reason for the inability of TAp73Ξ± to activate caspase-2S in experimental conditions, though it may be able to activate caspase-2S expression in vivo, in conditions where the effect of the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain is negated by other means. This possibility remains to be explored. Nevertheless, the 18-bp site to which the p73 members bind to on the caspase-2S promoter does not resemble the p53 consensus binding site. Rather, it contains a GC box, a putative binding site for Sp-1 transcription factor. Mutation of the GC box and knockdown of Sp-1 expression did not significantly affect TAp73Ξ²'s ability to activate the caspase-2S promoter, suggesting that TAp73Ξ² does not depend on Sp-1 to activate the promoter. Moreover, comparison of Sp-1 and TAp73Ξ²'s ability to activate the caspase-2S promoter indicated that TAp73Ξ² was a better activator than Sp-1, which only had a marginal effect, thereby excluding any critical role for the latter in caspase-2S activation. Furthermore, DNA-binding mutants of p73 were unable to activate the caspase-2S promoter and conversely, both in vivo ChIP experiments and in vitro DNA-binding assays revealed that p73 was able to bind to this DNA element, indicating that p73 can indeed directly bind to and activate the caspase-2S promoter. Whether this 18-bp element is a unique site that is of general utility for activation of p73-specific (and not p53- or p63-dependent) targets is yet to be explored. Overall, the findings highlight the specificity of TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² in the induction of caspase-2S expression.
The ability of both full-length TAp73Ξ² and the TA-deficient DNp73Ξ² to induce caspase-2S promoter activation is also surprising, but highlights that the DNp73 form may have the ability to activate target genes. There are not many reports that have highlighted that both of these forms can activate classical p53/p73 target genes, as traditionally, it has been thought that the TA domain is essential for transcription factors to recruit co-factors for transactivation of target genes. Therefore, the findings presented here suggest that DNp73Ξ² has unique transactivation ability, besides its role as a dominant-negative protein to inhibit p73 and p53 function. Two similar examples were reported, whereby DNp73Ξ± was shown to activate the expression of EGR1 and CDC6, and DNp73Ξ² was shown to activate classical p53 target genes (5,39). Mechanistically, how this occurs is unclear. It was speculated that the presence of a secondary TA domain in DNp73, which encompass the 13 unique residues at the NH2-terminus together with the PXXP motifs, may form a TA domain responsible for the activity of DNp73 (5). Alternatively, DNp73Ξ² may recruit other transcription factors to activate the capase-2S promoter activity. Whatever the mechanism may be, it is evident that DNp73 has the ability to activate target genes, which are unique and does not fall into to the classical β€�p53-targetβ€™ gene group.
Another noteworthy point is that both TAp73Ξ² and DNp73Ξ² were not able to activate the expression from the full-length caspase-2 promoter. Only after truncating the promoter to retain the caspase-2S promoter region specifically did we see an increase in promoter activity, suggesting the existence of repressor elements that may interfere with the induction of caspase-2S by p73Ξ². Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that usage of one promoter may be at the expense of the other, though this needs further investigation. This indicates that specific conditions may be required for the induction of caspase-2S by p73Ξ² in vivo in the physiological setting.
In conclusion, the data presented here provide evidence for the activation of the anti-apoptotic caspase-2S by both the tumour-suppressive TAp73Ξ² and the anti-apoptotic DNp73Ξ², which could be yet another mechanism to promote cellular survival in tumor settings where both p73 forms are over-expressed.
