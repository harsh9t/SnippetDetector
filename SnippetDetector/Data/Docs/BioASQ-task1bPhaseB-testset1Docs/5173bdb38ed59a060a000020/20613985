p63, a p53 family member, is expressed from two different promoters generating two classes of proteins: TAp63, containing the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain, and Ξ”Np63, lacking this domain. In addition, alternative splicing generates three different C-termini: Ξ±, Ξ² and Ξ³. Given that the transactivation activity resides in the protein's N-terminus, TAp63 isoforms function as transcription factors inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. TAp63Ξ³ is the most potent transcription activator [1], [2]. This isoform mimics p53 in culture and is capable of rescuing the growth inhibitory function of p53, in p53-deficient cells [3], [4]. These observations suggest that TAp63Ξ³ has tumor-suppressive properties analogous to p53. Supporting this notion is the fact that p63 maps to a chromosome region often deleted in cancers [5]. Likewise, loss of TAp63 expression has been detected in several cancers and has been associated with increased metastatic potential [6]β€“[8]. In opposition to the TA isoforms, Ξ”Np63 protects from apoptosis by directly competing for TAp63 target promoters [1], [9]. Over-expression of Ξ”Np63 isoforms observed in epithelial cancers suggests that p63 can also act as an oncogene [10]β€“[12]. However, the predominant physiological role of p63 is in epithelial development, as demonstrated by lack of epidermis and other epithelia in p63-deficient mice [13].
To avoid unwanted cell death accompanied by proper response to stress when needed, p53 family members have to be kept in check. In unstressed cells, p53 activity is restrained via the RING-type ubiquitin ligases Mdm2, Pirh2 and COP1. When cells encounter genotoxic stress, p53 protein levels rapidly increase. This correlates with a decrease in Mdm2 catalyzed poly-ubiquitylation and an increase in a variety of other post-translational modifications [14]. In contrast to the well-studied p53 protein, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating p63. Some evidence indicate that following genotoxic stress p63 is phosphorylated by kinases such as p38 MAP kinase resulting in stabilization of the TAp63 isoforms and detachment of Ξ”Np63Ξ± from p53-dependent promoters followed by its accelerated degradation [15]. Recent evidences have indicated a physical and functional relationship between p63 and Itch/AIP4, a HECT ubiquitin ligase. The data clearly indicate that all p63 isoforms are targeted by Itch for degradation [16]. In addition to the regulation of p63's degradation, crosstalk between p63 and proteins such as ASPP1/2 [17], PML [18], Sp1/3 [19] and p300 [20] has been shown to lead to increased transcriptional activity and stability of TAp63.
NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes two-electron reduction of quinones, with NADH/NADPH as electron donors. NQO1 expression is induced in response to a variety of signals including oxidants and ionizing radiation. A C609T substitution, encoding for a Pro187Ser amino acid change is the major NQO1 polymorphism described. This polymorphic variant possesses less than 4% of the wild-type enzymatic activity and is associated with increased risk of developing different types of tumors [21]β€“[23]. Recently, ornithine decarboxylase, p33ING1b, p53 and p73 were found to be degraded by 20S proteasomes and NQO1 was shown to inhibit this degradation [24]β€“[29]. The finding that NQO1 supports the accumulation of p53 attributes to NQO1 a role as a tumor suppressor.
Due to the structural similarities between p53 and p63, it seemed plausible that NQO1 also regulates p63 expression. Our study tests this idea. We have chosen to focus on TAp63Ξ³, as it is the most potent transcription activator and it is expected to have a role in tumor suppression. Our data demonstrate that wild-type but not C609T NQO1 binds to, stabilizes and inhibits 20S proteasomal degradation of TAp63Ξ³. We further show that downregulation of NQO1 inhibits TAp63Ξ³-dependant p21 upregulation and TAp63Ξ³-induced growth arrest stimulated by doxorubicin. These findings provide insight into the contribution of NQO1 to p63 stability.

Results
ild-type but not 609 1 stabilizes p63³ expression. The observation that NQO1 stabilizes p53 raised the question whether NQO1 also participates in dictating p63 expression level. To clarify this issue, we cotransfected FLAG-tagged NQO1 and TAp63Ξ³ expression plasmids into HCT116 and 293 cells. Both these cell lines do not express detectable levels of endogenous TAp63Ξ³ (Fig. 1A). As predicted, both HCT116 and 293 cells over-expressing NQO1 showed an increase in TAp63Ξ³ protein level (Fig. 1A). In order to test whether TAp63Ξ³ stabilization by NQO1 is dependent on p53, these transfections were also conducted in p53 null, HCT116β�’/β�’ cells. These cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous TAp63Ξ³ either (Fig. 1A). Once again, NQO1 over-expression resulted in elevated TAp63Ξ³ protein levels, suggesting that this effect is independent of the cell's p53 status (Fig. 1A). In order to confirm that NQO1 indeed prolongs TAp63Ξ³ stability, the degradation rate of TAp63Ξ³ in HCT116 cells treated with cyclohexamide was compared to that of TAp63Ξ³ in the presence of NQO1 in HCT116 cells treated with cyclohexamide. TAp63Ξ³ levels decreased significantly following cyclohexamide treatment and by 4 hours were nearly down to 20% compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 1B compare lanes 1, 2). In contrast, the level of TAp63Ξ³ in the presence of NQO1 was only moderately decreased, to 60%, following cyclohexamide treatment compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 1B compare lanes 3, 4). Similar results were documented in HCT116β�’/β�’ cells, once again implying that this effect is independent of the cell's p53 status (data not shown). No upregulation was observed in TAp63Ξ³ mRNA level under these conditions in 293 and HCT116β�’/β�’ cells. A slight upregulation in TAp63Ξ³ mRNA expression was detected in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the enzymatic activity of NQO1 is required for p63 stability, we transfected an HA-tagged C609T NQO1 expression plasmid into all 3 cell lines. Unlike wild-type NQO1, C609T NQO1 did not stabilize cotransfected TAp63Ξ³ (Fig. 1D). Of note, the expression of transfected C609T NQO1 in these cells was lower than that of transfected wild-type NQO1 (Fig. 1A and 1D, middle panels). Continuous attempts to increase C609T NQO1 expression level, in transient and even in stably transfected lines, failed. This is possibly due to the fact that the mutant protein is considered to be unstable [31]. In a paper published by Traver et al [32], the specific activity of C609T NQO1 purified protein from E. coli cells was 2% of the specific activity of the wild-type recombinant protein probably due to diminished ability to bind FAD. The authors state however that according to their data an additional possible reason for the lack of enzymatic activity could be to be due to very poor expression of the C609T NQO1 protein. These data therefore indicate that TAp63Ξ³ is stabilized by NQO1 and that NQO1 enzymatic activity may be required for this.10.1371/journal.pone.0011401.g001Figure 1TAp63Ξ³ protein is stabilized by NQO1.(A) 293, HCT116 and HCT116β�’/β�’ cells expressing endogenous NQO1 or over-expressing wild-type FLAG-NQO1 were transfected with a plasmid expressing TAp63Ξ³. Forty-eight hours post-transfection cell lysates were prepared and resolved by SDS-PAGE. TAp63Ξ³, NQO1 and GAPDH levels were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-p63 (4A4), anti-FLAG and anti-GAPDH (loading control) antibodies, respectively. (B) HCT116 cells expressing endogenous NQO1 or over-expressing wild-type FLAG-NQO1 were transfected with a plasmid expressing TAp63Ξ³. Twenty-four hours post transfection, 10Βµg/ml cyclohexamide (CHX) was added for 4 hours. Cell lysates were prepared and resolved by SDS-PAGE. TAp63Ξ³, NQO1 and GAPDH levels were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-p63 (4A4), anti-FLAG and anti-GAPDH (loading control) antibodies, respectively. (C) RNA was prepared from these same cells, reverse transcribed and RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for TAp63 and for gapdh. Data is represented as relative levels of TAp63Ξ³ normalized to gapdh. (D) 293, HCT116 and HCT116β�’/β�’ cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing TAp63Ξ³ and HA-C609T NQO1. Forty-eight hours post-transfection cell lysates were prepared and resolved by SDS-PAGE. TAp63Ξ³, NQO1 and GAPDH levels were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-p63 (4A4), anti-HA and anti-GAPDH (loading control) antibodies, respectively. (E) 293, HCT116 and HCT116β�’/β�’ cells were transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides or siNQO1 oligonucleotides. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cell were transfected with a plasmid expressing TAp63Ξ³. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cell lysates were prepared and resolved by SDS-PAGE. TAp63Ξ³, NQO1 and GAPDH levels were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-p63 (4A4), anti-NQO1 and anti-GAPDH (loading control) antibodies, respectively.Effect of NQO1 silencing on TAp63Ξ³ stabilityDicumarol is a common NQO1 inhibitor. However, dicumarol was shown to be nonspecific, inhibiting several quinone reductases and having many ancillary effects [33], [34]. Consequently, we decided to inhibit NQO1 by using NQO1 specific siRNA molecules. HCT116 and 293 cells were transfected with siNQO1 oligonucleotides or with scrambled oligonucleotides and with a TAp63Ξ³ expression plasmid. Expression of NQO1 mRNA and protein, in the presence of siNQO1, was reduced by an average of 99% and >60% as detected by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively (data not shown and Fig. 1E). In both cell lines, reduction in NQO1 caused a decrease in TAp63Ξ³ expression (Fig. 1E). A similar outcome of NQO1 silencing on p63 expression level was observed in HCT116β�’/β�’ cells, suggesting once again, that this effect is independent of the cell's p53 status (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that decreased NQO1 expression leads to downregulation of TAp63Ξ³.TAp63Ξ³ stabilization by NQO1 is enhanced under stressUnder normal growth conditions, TAp63Ξ³ protein level is elevated in cells over-expressing NQO1 (Fig. 1A). p63 expression is known to be induced following stress [35]. At this point, we were interested in determining the effect of NQO1 on TAp63Ξ³ following stress. To this end, cells co-transfected with TAp63Ξ³ and NQO1 expression plasmids were treated with DOX. We show that the stabilizing effect of NQO1 on TAp63Ξ³ was more prominent after induction of stress by DOX exposure (Fig. 2). In contrast, C609T NQO1 did not lead to elevated expression of TAp63Ξ³ following DOX treatment (data not shown). These findings suggest that NQO1 stabilizes TAp63Ξ³ to a higher extent in stressed cells as compared to unstressed cells and that NQO1 enzymatic activity may be required for this.10.1371/journal.pone.0011401.g002Figure 2TAp63Ξ³ expression is stabilized by NQO1 in response to genotoxic stress.293, HCT116 and HCT116β�’/β�’ cells expressing endogenous NQO1 or over-expressing wild-type FLAG-NQO1 were transfected with a plasmid expressing TAp63Ξ³. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were treated with 1ΒµM DOX for 24h. At this point, cell lysates were prepared and resolved by SDS-PAGE. TAp63Ξ³, NQO1 and GAPDH levels were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-p63 (4A4), anti-FLAG and anti-GAPDH (loading control) antibodies, respectively.Wild-type but not C609T NQO1 physically interacts with TAp63Ξ³To detect a potential physical association between TAp63Ξ³ and NQO1, 293 cells stably expressing HA-NQO1 were transfected with a TAp63Ξ³ expression plasmid. Fig. 3A demonstrates that immunoprecipitation of HA-NQO1 pulled down TAp63Ξ³ (lane 1β€“2). In agreement, immunoprecipitation of TAp63Ξ³ pulled down HA-NQO1 (lane 5β€“6). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of C609T NQO1 did not pull down this p63 isoform under the same conditions (Fig. 3A, lanes 3β€“4). These data confirm that TAp63Ξ³ and NQO1 do interact physically and that this interaction may be dependent on the catalytic activity of NQO1.10.1371/journal.pone.0011401.g003Figure 3NQO1 physically associates with TAp63Ξ³ and protects it from 20S proteasomal degradation.(A) 293 cells stably expressing HA-NQO1 or HA-C609T NQO1 were transfected with a plasmid expressing TAp63Ξ³. Cellular extracts were prepared and subject to immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA or anti-p63 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins and 5% of input material were detected by Western blot using anti-p63 and anti-HA antibodies. (B) Degradation of in-vitro translated, biotin-labeled TAp63Ξ³ with 20S proteasome was carried out in the presence or absence of in-vitro translated, biotin-labeled NQO1 and 1mM NADH at 37Β°C for 4h. Biotin-labeled TAp63Ξ³ and NQO1 were detected with fluorescently-labeled streptavidin.NQO1 protects TAp63Ξ³ from 20S proteasomal degradationTo study whether NQO1 protects TAp63Ξ³ from degradation, an in-vitro degradation assay was performed. In this assay, in-vitro translated TAp63Ξ³ was used as a substrate for degradation by 20S proteasomes in the absence or presence of in-vitro translated NQO1. As has previously been shown for p53 and p73 [26]β€“[29], TAp63Ξ³ was degraded by 20S proteasomes. This degradation was inhibited in the presence of excess NQO1 and its cofactor, NADH, suggesting that NQO1 directly protects TAp63Ξ³ from degradation by 20S proteasomes (Fig. 3B). Unlike wild-type NQO1, C609T NQO1 did not inhibit this degradation (data not shown). It should be noted that the expression level of C609T NQO1 in the presence of 20S proteasomes was very low compared to wild-type NQO1. It is impossible to establish, at this point, whether the absence of inhibition of TAp63Ξ³ degradation by C609T NQO1 was due to the incompetence of C609T NQO1 or was it merely a result of its low expression level.Downregulation of NQO1 inhibits TAp63Ξ³-mediated growth arrestWe next determined whether NQO1-dependant TAp63Ξ³ accumulation could initiate growth arrest or apoptosis. In order to neutralize the effect of p53, p53 null HCT116β�’/β�’ cells were used. Since HCT116 cells tend to undergo growth arrest rather than apoptosis we tested the effect of NQO1 on TAp63Ξ³-mediated growth arrest. Exposure of HCT116β�’/β�’ cells to DOX resulted in G2 arrest (Fig. 4C). The presence of TAp63Ξ³ lead to a slight increase in G2 arrested cells (Fig. 4D). A 5-fold increase in p21 mRNA expression was also detected in these TAp63Ξ³ over-expressing cells exposed to DOX in comparison to cell exposed to DOX but not expressing TAp63Ξ³ (Fig. 4I). NQO1 inhibition in DOX treated, TAp63Ξ³ transfected cells, resulted in a reduction of G2 arrested cells to the level observed following DOX in cells not expressing TAp63Ξ³ (Fig. 3H). Accordingly, TAp63Ξ³ and DOX-mediated increase in p21 level was almost completely reversed by siNQO1 (Fig. 3I). Expression of TAp63Ξ³, without an additional stress signal, did not lead to cell cycle arrest in our setting. These results are consistent with our NQO1 overexpression and silencing data and suggest that NQO1 is an important regulator of TAp63Ξ³ and consequently of p21. Our data indicate that downregulation of NQO1 inhibits TAp63Ξ³-mediated p21 upregulation and TAp63Ξ³-induced G2 arrest in DOX treated HCT116β�’/β�’ cells.10.1371/journal.pone.0011401.g004Figure 4Downregulation of NQO1 inhibits TAp63Ξ³-dependent growth arrest in DOX treated HCT116β�’/β�’ cells.HCT116β�’/β�’ cells were transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides (siControl) (Aβ€“D) or siNQO1 oligonucleotides (Eβ€“H) and transfected (B, D, F, H) or not (A, C, E, G) with a plasmid expressing TAp63Ξ³.

Discussion
imilar to p53, p63³ protein level increases upon treatment with  damaging agents resulting in transactivation of p53-responsive genes assigning p63 as an important component of the cell's apoptotic machinery [35]β€“[37]. his p63 upregulation is not the result of transcriptional activation, but is most likely due to an increase at the protein level [36], [37]. o date, little is known of the molecular mechanisms regulating p63 protein level. e provide in-vitro evidence for a physical and functional relationship between p63³ and 1 supporting a new pathway regulating p63 stability.
n different types of unstressed cells, wild-type 1 bound to and stabilized p63³. n contrast, we show that 609 1 is unable to associate with p63³ or to affect its protein level. his observation emphasizes the requirement of proper 1 enzymatic activity for p63 stabilization. t remains to be determined whether intact enzymatic activity of 1 and its binding to p63³ is sufficient for p63 stabilization. 1 did not alter the expression of  or retinoblastoma (data not shown for retinoblastoma) implying that this protein degradation regulatory pathway is specific to certain proteins.
p63 has been shown to undergo  mediated 26 proteasome degradation [16]. ur results show that, in addition, p63³ is subjected to 20 proteasomal degradation and that 1 protects p63³ from such degradation. his finding implies that p63 stabilization may involve several parallel mechanisms.
any evidence support the notion that p63 has tumor suppressor functions: 1) p63 specific si. RNA enhances the transformation potential of p53β�’/β�’ MEFs [38]; 2) p63 can mediate chemo-sensitivity independent of p53 status by induction of apoptosis [17], [39]; 3) The combined absence of p63 and p73 severely impairs the induction of p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage [40]. These observations suggest that p63 may complement, and in some circumstances substitute for p53. For these reasons complex molecular mechanisms must regulate the expression of the p63 isoforms. Phosphorylation has been reported to be associated with rapid accumulation of TAp63Ξ³ upon genotoxic treatment whereas Ξ”Np63Ξ± is degraded under these same conditions [15]. Coherently, in our settings, NQO1 over-expression accompanied by stress (DOX) resulted in the accumulation of TAp63Ξ³ and not in the accumulation of the antagonizing Ξ”N isoforms or the weak TAp63Ξ³ (data not shown). Stabilization of TAp63Ξ³ by NQO1 is of biological relevance since the ability of TAp63Ξ³ to upregulate p21 and to induce G2 arrest in stressed HCT116β�’/β�’ cells is almost abolished in the presence of siNQO1.
Our results have biological implications concerning the understanding of tumor development. Cells carrying polymorphic inactive NQO1 that are exposed to carcinogens that are substrate for detoxification by NQO1 will accumulate more damage than cells carrying wild-type NQO1. Our results show that polymorphic NQO1 does not stabilize TAp63Ξ³ and low wild-type NQO1 levels (as detected in cells harboring one allele of polymorphic NQO1) decrease TAp63Ξ³-induced growth arrest. These cells, already harboring damaged DNA, would therefore also exhibit imperfect apoptotic or growth arrest responses, providing them with a growth advantage that could potentially lead to tumor development. Indeed, p63 is not frequently mutated in cancer but rather alterations of p63 expression have been widely reported [10]β€“[12], [41]. Of note, C609T NQO1 is known to enhance susceptibility to bladder and breast cancers [21]β€“[23]. In these same tumor types, TAp63 expression is often misregulated [6]β€“[8]. The altered TAp63 expression levels detected in these tumors may be explained by the incompetence of C609T NQO1 to properly stabilize p63. In one study, Fagerholm et al demonstrated that the chemotherapeutic response of C609T homozygous breast carcinoma cells was impaired in p53-aberrant tumors [21]. This phenomenon could be attributed to the inability of polymorphic NQO1 to stabilize TAp63, whose expression was indeed shown to be significantly reduced in breast cancers. TAp63 reduction could result in the poor chemotherapeutic response characteristic of these tumor cells.
Our report is the first to identify a new mechanism appointing a direct role for NQO1 in the regulation of p63 expression, especially following stress. We propose that NQO1 associates with and stabilizes TAp63Ξ³. The increase in TAp63Ξ³ results in enhanced transcription of p21 consequently leading to growth arrest. Characterization of the interactions between NQO1 and the other p63 family members would be an interesting future study. Such studies will probably elucidate that NQO1 not only regulates the expression of the potent TAp63Ξ³ but more realistically it regulates the balance of p63 isoforms under normal growth conditions and following stress. It will be interesting to explore how this level of regulation collaborates with others as more regulators of p63 are found. Clearly, comprehension of such regulations of the p63 isoforms will lead to a greater understanding of the role of p63 in tumor suppression.
