p73 is a p53-related transcription factor with fundamental roles in development,1-4 tumor suppression5-11 and senescence.12-23 Transcription from two different promoters on the TRp73 gene results in generation of TAp73 and Ξ”Np73 isoforms with opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions.24-28 Although p73 shares tumor-suppression functions with p53,29-44 it plays some very distinctive roles in development.45-47 Mice lacking p73 show neurodegeneration, defects in pheromone detection as well as chronic infection and inflammation that lead to a shorter lifespan.3 In vivo studies demonstrated that more than 70% of mice lacking TAp73 develop tumors.48 On the other hand, Ξ”Np73 isoforms are known to exhibit dominant-negative activity toward the tumor-suppressor functions of both TAp73 and p53 and also act as a negative regulator of DNA damage response.27,49-53 Besides, Ξ”Np73 interferes with many developmental programs, such as the myogenic differentiation program.54 Moreover, both TAp73 and Ξ”Np73 KO models show mild degenerative phenotypes, underlying the importance of p73 in brain development.48,55-60 This scenario becomes even more complex by focusing on the C terminus, where many splicing events occur, giving rise to at least seven different isoforms.61 p73Ξ± is the only one that contains a fully functional sterile alpha motif (SAM), which has been described as a putative protein-protein interaction domain.62-64 TAp73Ξ³ rises from alternative splicing at exon 11 and p73Ξ΄, missing exon 11, 12 and 13.65 Although p73Ξ³ retains all the exons coding for SAM domain, the splicing event at exon 11 produces a shift of the reading frame, leading to a premature STOP codon.65 Stimulation of human peripheral blood led to identification of two additional isoforms, p73Ξµ and p73Ξ¶, with p73Ξµ lacking exon 11 and 13 and p73Ξ¶ excluding exons 11 and 12.66 Elucidation of p73Ξ¶ isoform clarifies that this splicing variant includes most of the SAM domain, although it misses a hydrophobic residue that seems to be fundamental for stability and consequent domain functionality.66 Similar observation was pointed out in this study, regarding the isoform p73Ξµ. In this case, the deletion covers the first three amino acids of an Ξ±-helix, negatively influencing proper folding of the domain. Even if p73Ξ³ encodes for all the exons involved in the SAM domain, due to the splicing at exon 11, the open reading frame is different.65,67 Here, we investigated the tissue spatiotemporal expression profile of all p73 isoforms in mice and their expression switch under stressed conditions.

Results
dentification of mouse p73 -terminal isoforms. FigureΒ 1A reports a schematic representation of the alternative splicing occurring in the C-terminal region of human p73 gene. Based on this, we tried to understand whether all the isoforms identified in human were also present in the mouse. There are commercial antibodies available, sensitive enough to detect p73 and its N-terminal variants;68,69 however, these antibodies fail to discriminate C-terminal isoforms at endogenous levels in the mouse. For this reason, we monitored mRNA levels. Organs from adult (2-mo-old) C57Bl/6 mice were collected and RNA was extracted (Fig.Β 2). cDNA derived from kidney was then used for PCR in saturating conditions (40 cycles). PCR was performed by using forward and reverse primers designed, respectively, on exons 10 and 14. As an empty control we used RNase DNase-free water. We were able to detect all the isoforms, although the signal deriving from some of them was much weaker than others (Fig.Β 1B). To overcome this problem and to further prove the existence of all isoforms, we performed a PCR using isoform-specific primers designed at the specific exon-exon junctions. Through this strategy, we generated a specific PCR for each C-terminal splicing variant. As shown in FigureΒ 1C, all the isoforms were easily detected. Identity of the isoforms was further confirmed by DNA sequencing on PCR products.FigureΒ 1. C-terminal isoforms of p73. (A) Schematic representation of splicing of human C-terminal p73. (B) RNA from kidney of adult mouse was reversed transcribed and cDNA was amplified by PCR. Product was run on 10% acrylamide gel. All the isoforms identified in human were detected and distinguished for different nucleotide length. (C) cDNA derived from an adult mouse was also amplified using isoforms-specific primers for each specific splicing variants. PCR products were run on agarose gel. All experiments have been repeated at least three times. Ctrl, control (DNase RNase-free H2O).FigureΒ 2. Organs-specific expression of p73 C-terminal isoforms. Screening of the isoform expression in organs of 2-mo-old mice. RT-PCR was performed using primers that amplify all isoforms (exons 10β€“14, mp73-X10 FWD and mp73-X14 REV). Samples were analyzed as in FigureΒ 1B, and representative result is depicted. Experiments have been reproduced at least three times. Olfac. Bulb, olfactory bulb; ctrl, control.Analysis of organ-specific expression of mouse p73 C-terminal isoformsThe expression of human p73 variants has been characterized in different tissues and cell lines.65,66,70,71 Since the expression pattern in the mouse has still not been investigated, we analyzed different organs using the same strategy used in FigureΒ 1B and performing PCR in saturating conditions (40 cycles) in order to detect all possible isoforms. We found out that C-terminal variants of p73 are expressed in all the organs tested, even if at different levels, with p73Ξ± being the most abundant (Fig.Β 2). Since we detected also products at unexpected mobility shifts, we sequenced all of them, but we failed to identify brand new isoforms, while we confirmed presence of all the variants previously described in human.Analysis of isoforms expression at different developmental stagesWe then focused on expression upon different developmental stages, since p73 seems to be a key regulator in this process.60,72-75 We started from embryonic up to adult stages (2-mo-old). In this case, we performed a semi-quantitative RT-PCR (30 cycles). Quantification was done in relationship with starting levels (E12). Also in this system, p73Ξ± was the most abundant isoform, even if it did not undergo major changes, while p73Ξ¶, but also to a smaller extent, p73Ξµ and p73Ξ΄, were upregulated over time (Fig.Β 3A and B). P73Ξ³, on the other hand, was downregulated during development (Fig.Β 3A and B). We also monitored levels of TAp73 (25 cycles) and Ξ”Np73 (30 cycles); we determined that TAp73 was more abundant than Ξ”Np73, even if, on the other hand, there was no significant regulation during development of any of the N-terminal variants (Fig.Β 3A and C). This type of analysis also revealed other migrating band at unexpected sizes (Fig.Β 3A), which were sequenced, but revealed to be not specific.FigureΒ 3. Expression of C-terminal isoforms during mouse development. Screening of the isoform expression during mouse development starting from embryonic stage E12, reaching adult (2 mo) age. Samples were analyzed as in FigureΒ 1B and a representative result is depicted in (A). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (30 cycles for C-terminal p73, 20 cycles for GAPDH) was performed and samples were run on a 10% acrylamide gel. Densitometry analysis was performed on at least three gels in order to quantify C-terminal isoforms levels (B) or TAp73 and Ξ”Np73 levels (C). Experiments have been repeated at least three times. E, embryonic stage; P7, seventh day after birth; TA, TAp73; Ξ”n, Ξ”Np73; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Analysis of isoforms expression upon DNA damage in vitroSince p73 is induced upon DNA damage and its loss confers resistance to cell death,48,76-78 we checked whether cytotoxic drug treatments, with cisplatin79,80 or etoposide,81-84 affected expression levels of C-terminal isoforms in the N2a cell line. In semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Ξ±-isoform results slightly increased, while p73Ξ² and p73Ξ¶ appeared strongly decreased (Fig.Β 4Aβ€“C). In another system instead, the expression levels of the isoforms varied slightly. Indeed, in spleen-derived primary splenocytes, p73Ξ³ and p73Ξµ were the two most upregulated isoforms upon DNA damage, while p73Ξ¶ was downregulated, consistently with the results in N2a cells (Fig.Β 5A and B). In this scenario, we also monitored levels of N-terminal isoforms. TA levels at 24 h were lower than untreated cells, while Ξ”N levels were comparable between treated vs. untreated at 24 h. Levels of TA and Ξ”N were lower at 24 h than at 6 h, probably due to ongoing massive apoptotic events, as demonstrated by PARP cleavage85-89 (Fig.Β S1).FigureΒ 4. C-terminal isoform expression upon DNA damage in vitro. N2a (neuroblastoma cell line) were treated with 1 ΞΌg/ml etoposide or 5 ΞΌg/ml cisplatin, collected at the indicated time points and processed. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (30 cycles for C-terminal p73, 20 cycles for GAPDH) was performed, and samples were run on a 10% acrylamide gel. A representative example (of at least three experiments) is depicted in (A). Densitometry analysis of at least three gels was achieved, relative to untreated cells, upon cisplatin treatment (B) or etoposide treatment (C). Cispl, cisplatin; Eto, etoposide; untr., untreated; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.FigureΒ 5. C-terminal isoforms expression upon DNA damage in primary splenocytes. Primary splenocytes were treated with 1 ΞΌg/ml etoposide or 5 ΞΌg/ml cisplatin, collected at the indicated time points and processed. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (30 cycles for C-terminal p73, 20 cycles for GAPDH) was performed and samples were run on a 10% acrylamide gel. Representative result is depicted in (A). Densitometry analysis of at least three blots was achieved, relative to starting point (untreated, 6 h), to monitor C-terminal isoforms levels (B), TAp73 levels (C) and Ξ”Np73 levels (D) over time. Cispl, cisplatin; Eto, etoposide; untr., untreated; TA, TAp73; Ξ”n, Ξ”Np73; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Analysis of isoforms expression upon DNA damage in vivoFinally, we investigated the effects on levels of p73 C-terminal isoforms in vivo upon DNA damage. We treated adult mice intra-peritoneally and analyzed levels of C-terminal isoforms 20 h after treatment. We had different outcomes in relationship to the tissue analyzed, probably due to the ability of the drug to reach different organs but most likely also depending on starting endogenous levels of p73. In some organs, such as in the lung, all the isoforms were induced (Fig.Β 6Aβ€“C), while in other organs, there were no detectable effects of p73 levels, such as in the heart (data not shown). Moreover, in other tissues there were varying effects depending on the treatment that the animal received; in the spleen for example, etoposide was capable of inducing all isoforms (Fig.Β 6D and E), while cisplatin was causing a shift from Ξ±-isoform toward p73Ξ³ and p73Ξ΄ (Fig.Β 6D and F).FigureΒ 6. C-terminal isoforms expression upon DNA damage in vivo. C57Bl/6 mice (2-mo-old, n β‰¥ 6 per group) were treated i.p. with 10 mg/kg etoposide or 5 mg/kg cisplatin or with PBS (control group). Animals were sacrificed after 20 h and tissues were then processed. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (24 cycles for C-terminal p73, 20 cycles for GAPDH) was performed and samples were run on a 10% acrylamide gel. Example of results deriving from lung is depicted in (A). Densitometry analysis of at least three blots was achieved, showing levels of C-terminal isoforms upon etoposide (B) or cisplatin treatment (C). The same was done for the spleen (D) and quantification upon etoposide (E) or cisplatin (F) is shown. Cispl, cisplatin; Eto, etoposide; untr., untreated; TA, TAp73; Ξ”n, Ξ”Np73; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Here, we identified and characterized the tissue-specific expression of C-terminal isoforms of murine p73. This has been partly published regarding human p73, while investigation on its murine counterpart has been totally neglected. The isoform-specific KO mice models focused only on the characterization of p73 N terminus.48,55,56 These tools yield a lot of insight into understanding functions and roles of the specific N-terminal isoforms of p73; however, they leave some unsolved questions, since not all the defects displayed by the full p73β�’/β�’ mouse3 were represented in one of these two models. For example, both TAp73β�’/β�’ and Ξ”Np73β�’/β�’ show mild neurological defects, while the full p73β�’/β�’ displays a more penetrant phenotype; besides, the strong immunological defect found in the full p73β�’/β�’ mice is absent in the TAp73β�’/β�’ or Ξ”Np73β�’/β�’, leading to the conclusion that other factors might be involved. We may speculate that TAp73 and Ξ”Np73 could have overlapping functions that allow one isoform to overcome the absence of the other and vice versa. Moreover, C-terminal domains might play a role in this, since in the N-terminal KO models they were still expressed and functional in the remaining N-terminal isoform. As support to this theory, there is the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) at the C terminus of p73. SAM domains are small putative protein-protein interaction domains,90 and in the mouse, this region overlaps exons 12β€“14 of p73;63 therefore, only Ξ± encodes a fully functional SAM domain and hypothetically could have an unique pool of interaction partners. Moreover, it has been shown that p73 SAM domain, but also the extreme C terminus, are able to regulate negatively the transcriptional activity of the protein,91,92 while on the other hand, deletion of SAM domain and extreme C terminus enhances transactivation and DNA-binding activity but inhibits apoptosis.92 Thus, it is striking that in all the tissues analyzed, we identified Ξ± as the most abundant. It could possibly have some involvement with control of proliferation, since presence of a fully functional SAM domain apparently inhibits it. This could be an incredibly interesting and still not described aspect of control of p73. In fact, the p73Ξ², rather than Ξ±, variant has an interesting potential to transactivate target genes.65 This similarity retains from p63, where the C-terminal domains (TI and SAM) have been proved to act as dominant transcription repression modules.93-99 Many mutations found in the AEC syndrome have been shown to destabilize or modify the structure of one of the helices of this region, leading to a loss of function and a consequent deregulation in transactivation and growth suppression.100-104 These findings clearly state a connection between functionality of the SAM domain and AEC syndrome, opening possible new hints of investigation for its p73 homolog. In absence of triggers, the most preferred isoform transcribed could be p73Ξ±, due to its low transactivation potential, while upon a specific stimulus there could be a shift toward other isoforms, as we were able to highlight at developmental stages but also upon DNA damaging agents. Another interesting new aspect was highlighted by our work: no striking differences between TAp73 and Ξ”Np73 levels were detected during development or upon stresses. Instead C-terminal isoforms resulted to be tightly regulated; for example, during development, p73Ξµ, p73Ξ¶ and to a lesser extent p73Ξ΄, were specifically, induced while Ξ³ was downregulated. Also, upon DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, we highlighted specific regulation of each isoform, suggesting that every C-terminal variant could play specific roles, possibly depending on the tissue or cell system analyzed. In line with this, interesting observations have been made on the C terminus of p63; in fact, mutations leading to premature stop codon in exon 14 of p63 are correlated with limb mammary syndrome and SHFM (split-hand-foot malformation).105-107 For these reasons, a further analysis should be done in order to clarify aspects regarding p73 functions correlated with its C terminus. Moreover, it is now becoming crucial to generate C-terminal isoform-specific KO models, which could also become powerful tools for studying potential human diseases correlated by p73 misfunctions, such as neurodegeneration108-113 and cancer.34,114-120
Our work also underlined the incredible necessity of developing an antibody with enough sensitivity to detect endogenous p73 C-terminal isoforms, as well as an antibody specific for the SAM domain. This would open a wide range of new directions, including screening for interaction partners, due to the putative function of the SAM. It would be intriguing to investigate influences of the SAM on tetramerization of p73, since this domain has been suggested to play a role in regulation of transcription through lipids interaction.121-123 Studying interactions with new partners, with powerful techniques such as TAP tag124,125 or MAPPIT,126,127 could lead to some clarifications of p73β€™s still unknown functions, related, for example, to strong defects in brain and chronic inflammation.
To conclude, this work identifies the C-terminal isoforms transcribed in the mouse, upon endogenous and challenging conditions. It underlines the extreme importance of studying these isoforms more in detail, since they could play a fundamental and still-not-investigated role in pathologies such as cancer, degeneration and development.
