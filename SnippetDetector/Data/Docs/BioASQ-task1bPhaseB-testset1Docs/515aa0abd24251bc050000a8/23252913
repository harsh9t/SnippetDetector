In an effort to map the human proteome, the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) was recently initiated. As a member of the international consortium working on this project, our laboratory developed a gene-centric proteomic database called GenomewidePDB, which integrates proteomic data for proteins encoded by chromosomes with transcriptomic data and other information from public databases. As an example case, we chose chromosome 13, which is the largest acrocentric human chromosome with the lowest gene density and contains 326 predicted proteins. All proteins stored in GenomewidePDB are linked to other resources, including neXtProt and Ensembl for protein and gene information, respectively. The Global Proteome Machine database (GPMdb) and the PeptideAtlas are also accessed for observed mass spectrometry (MS) information, while Human Protein Atlas is used for information regarding antibody availability and tissue expression, respectively. Gene ontology disease information is also included. As a pilot work, we constructed this GenomewidePDB with the identified 3615 proteins including 53 chromosome 13-origin proteins that are present in normal human placenta tissue. Thus, developing a comprehensive database containing actual experimental proteomics data will provide a valuable resource for cross chromosomal comparison in the C-HPP community.
