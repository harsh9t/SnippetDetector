Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis () is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of motor neurons in brain and spinal cord causes progressive weakness and paralysis, ultimately leading to death from respiratory failure1. rontotemporal dementia () is one of the most common forms of young-onset dementia and is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, leading to changes in personality or language impairment23.  and  share numerous similarities at the genetic and neuropathological level, clinically they can co-occur, and they have been proposed to be part of the same spectrum of disease4.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of motor neurons in brain and spinal cord causes progressive weakness and paralysis, ultimately leading to death from respiratory failure1. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is one of the most common forms of young-onset dementia and is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, leading to changes in personality or language impairment23. ALS and FTD share numerous similarities at the genetic and neuropathological level, clinically they can co-occur, and they have been proposed to be part of the same spectrum of disease4.

These can occur in both DNA and RNA and consist of stacks of planar layers of G-tetrad units, named G-quartets in which the G bases are arranged in a square cyclic pattern held together by eight hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1a). When stacked the tetrads form a central cavity formed from guanine O6 atoms, where they can interact with metal cations. Monovalent metal cations bound in this central channel significantly affect the stability (K+ > Na+ > Li+) and topology of the folded G-quadruplex structure7.

Results
n silico analysis predicts 9orf72 -repeats form -quadruplexes. The GGGGCC-expansion lies in the 5β€² region of C9orf72 intron 1 (Fig. 2b). Control individuals are reported to have <30 repeats, but the majority of controls have 2 repeats561617. Nonetheless, using the EuQuad database18, which identifies G-quadruplex forming sequences in eukaryotic genomes, the three GGGGCC-repeats and adjacent GGGGC nucleotides present in the human reference C9orf72 gene sequence, are recognized as a G-quadruplex forming sequence. We therefore termed this sequence the minimal C9orf72 G-quadruplex repeat unit (C9Gru). The prediction is supported by the G-quadruplex analysis tool QGRS Mapper9: the full C9orf72 genomic sequence containing the C9Gru sequence shows one predicted four stacked G-quadruplex with a high predictive score (Fig. 2a). When inputting a pathogenic sequence containing 800 hexamer (GGGGCC) repeats the number of predicted 4 stacked G-quadruplexes increases accordingly (Fig. 2b).GGGGCC-repeats form RNA G-quadruplexes1D 1H NMR is a key technique in providing unequivocal experimental evidence of G-tetrad and quadruplex formation. We used NMR to investigate the structure of an RNA oligonucleotide consisting of the C9Gru sequence. NMR analysis in 10β€…mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, prior to refolding in the presence of quadruplex stabilizing cations, revealed the presence of imino proton peaks between 12 to 14β€…ppm, a region of the spectrum characteristic of Watson-Crick (W-C) hydrogen bonding (Supplementary Fig. S1). Raising the potassium chloride concentration to 40β€…mM and annealing the RNA allowed the C9Gru oligonucleotide to be refolded in the presence of stabilizing cations. At room temperature the 1D 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of a broad envelope of peaks between 10 and 11.5β€…ppm, and several distinct peaks characteristic of G-tetrad formation (Fig. 3). The appearance of peaks consistent with tetrad formations coincides with the loss of W-C peaks between 12 to 13β€…ppm. The buffered C9Gru RNA oligonucleotide was then heated, stepwise (+5β€…K) from 273β€…K to 333β€…K, but without a significant change observed in the spectra, indicating the stability of the folded quadruplex and retention of the G-tetrads. As clear and distinct peaks could not be differentiated within the imino region, further structural analysis was not pursued.GGGGCC G-quadruplexes are highly stable and parallel orientedG-quadruplexes can adopt three possible topologies according to the directions of the strands, these can be parallel, anti-parallel or mixed. Riboguanosine has a strong propensity to adopt the β€�anti' conformation and therefore to give rise to parallel G-quadruplex structures. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a standard method used to analyse structural features of G-quadruplexes1920. We used this technique to characterize the structural conformation of the C9Gru RNA sequence in a 40β€…mM KCl buffer. This showed a positive peak at 262β€…nm and a negative peak at 237β€…nm (Fig. 4a), which are the hallmarks of a parallel-oriented G-quadruplex structure19.To study the stability of the G-quadruplex motif found in the C9Gru G-quadruplex structure, we performed melting experiments by increasing the temperature from 15Β°C to 95Β°C using a 1Β°C/min gradient. The CD spectra were measured with 10Β°C intervals and showed a strong overlay from 15Β°C to 75Β°C with a reduction of the 262β€…nm peak only starting at 85Β°C, indicating a strong stability of the formed structure (Fig. 4a). Folding was fully reversible, but lagged behind the unfolding indicating either a slow refolding process or intermolecular quadruplex formation (Fig. 4b).To gain information on whether the G-quadruplexes are formed intermolecularly or intramolecularly, we analysed the melting profile temperature by diluting the C9Gru RNA oligonucleotide 10-fold (0.46β€…ΞΌM) in buffer containing 40β€…mM KCl. The spectrum displayed the same characteristic maximum and minimum around 262 and 237β€…nm, respectively. Furthermore, the structure remained highly stable and retained the same amount of structure at 95Β°C as seen in the concentrated sample (Supplementary Fig. S2). This result indicates the formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex19.GGGGCC G-quadruplex stability is cation dependentThe stability of the G-quadruplex structure is strongly influenced by the presence of monovalent cations between the G-quartet stacks. K+ promotes stable folding over Na+ and Li+ ions. We therefore compared the C9Gru RNA structure in the presence of either K+ or Li+. CD results showed a reduction of the formed structure in the presence of Li+, with a reduction of the 262β€…nm peak by ~30%, and a reduction in stability of the quadruplex and the cooperativity of the fold (Fig. 4c).Together, these CD data show that GGGGCC RNA repeats fold into a very stable, parallel intramolecular G-quadruplex structure.

Discussion
ur investigations show the 9orf72 -hexanucleotide repeat forms -quadruplexes and these adopt a parallel topology as illustrated in the model in igure 1b. ur structural data confirm in silico predictions that attribute a high probability of forming -quadruplexes to the -repeat.
ith regards to quadruplex topology, in contrast to  -quadruplexes,  -quadruplexes generally disfavour folded topologies with phosphate backbones running antiparallel containing mixed syn and anti glycosidic bonds.  preference of the ribose sugar puckers for the 3'-endo conformation favours the anti-conformation and so an all-parallel topology21. tructural studies have suggested that stability is derived through the 2β€²- groups and their intra-and inter molecular interactions with the ribose 4β€² atom for 3β€²-endo pucker and the 2 guanine amine for 2β€²-endo puckers22. owever, this preference is not absolute and examples of  adopting the anti-conformation exist23. ur results show that similar to most other  -quadruplexes, the 9orf72 -repeat -quadruplex adopts a parallel conformation. he -repeat -quadruplexes, similar to other  -quadruplexes, are very thermodynamically stable at physiological intracellular potassium ion concentrations. ur  data obtained from the  oligomer dilution also suggests that quadruplexes form intramolecularly. n the context of the 9orf72 expansion, where the hexanucleotide repeats are >700, it remains to be assessed whether quadruplexes form by association of adjacent repeats or from distant tracts of the sequence.
he - causing expansions in 9orf72 are formed by a very large number of repeats, which is thought to range between 700 and 1,400 hexamers5. lthough we have shown the propensity of the basic repeats composing this expansion to form -quadruplexes, the extended structure of this very long  sequence is not yet known. vidence of ternary structure from  transcripts of telomeric repeat () sequences containing several hundred -quadruplex-forming hexamers, indicates a β€�bead on a string modelβ€� with stacked quadruplex dimers, using 3β€² or 5β€² interfaces, connected by the intervening linkers to the next pairing2425. herefore, we would predict that many quadruplexes would be formed within the 9orf72 expansion, and that quadruplexes would stack as dimers.
hree transcript variants (1, 2, 3) have been described for the 9orf72 gene: 2 and 3 utilize exon 1a and therefore include the hexanucleotide repeat, while 1 utilizes the alternative exon 1b therefore excluding the hexanucleotide repeat, which is located upstream of the transcription start site5 (ig. 2a). eal time - data from patient brain and cell lines has shown that the presence of the expanded repeat causes a reduction in 1 transcription516. 2 and 3 were shown to be transcribed in patient frontal cortex c. DNA, which was confirmed by the detection of the hexanucleotide repeats in nuclear foci in patients' brains by in situ hybridization5. A second study used real-time PCR to show that V2 levels were reduced in patient frontal cortex16. Therefore further studies are required to clarify the extent of transcription of the expanded repeat in V2 and V3 in relevant patient tissues. As GGGGCC RNA repeats form G-quadruplexes, it is likely that the DNA sequence also forms these structures. There is evidence that DNA G-quadruplexes on the template strand (also known as the non-coding strand) can inhibit transcription26. It has also been suggested that G-quadruplexes forming on the coding or non-template strand, as is the case with the C9orf72 repeats, could enhance transcription by keeping the template strand single stranded26. This would be consistent with transcription through the repeat and the identification of nuclear RNA foci containing the repeat in patient tissue5. Further work will be required to determine the extent and mechanism of transcription of the C9orf72 repeat sequence. Whether disease is caused by a toxic effect of the GGGGCC-repeat RNA, by a loss of function of C9orf72 or by both mechanisms is yet to be determined.
Repeat expansions in the 3β€² UTR of DMPK and in intron 1 of ZNF9 were shown to cause Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 and 2 respectively (DM1 and DM2)2728. These mutations are similar to C9orf72 expansions in being located in non-coding regions of the respective genes and in forming nuclear RNA foci in patient tissue and cells. Although loss of transcript has been suggested to play a role in both DM1 and DM22930, the fact that two repeat sequences located in entirely different genes can cause such similar disease features, implies a potential common pathogenic mechanism by RNA gain-of-function31. Indeed, it has been shown that RNA binding proteins, such as MBNL1, are sequestered away from their normal RNA targets by interaction with the expanded repeats32. This leads to aberrant functional downstream effects which directly cause aspects of the myotonic dystrophy phenotype333435. The expanded repeats that cause DM1 fold into a stable hairpin structure that mimics the normal MBNL1 RNA-binding site3637. These findings suggest it is possible that the expanded GGGGCC-repeat may act in a similar fashion. In this light, the secondary structure of the RNA repeat expansion is crucial in determining which proteins it binds to.
G-quadruplexes have been shown to play a role in a variety of biological processes1314. A number of these functions are carried out by the interaction with G-quadruplex binding proteins and the sequestration of these proteins could lead to downstream effects that play a role in the disease pathogenesis. While many DNA G-quadruplex binding proteins have been identified, relatively few proteins have been confirmed to bind RNA G-quadruplexes38. A prominent example of an RNA G-quadruplex binding protein is the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP39, but it is currently unknown whether FMRP is sequestered by the C9orf72 expanded GGGGCC-repeats. Further work will be required to determine whether specific proteins bind to the repeats and what role they might play in disease pathogenesis. If RNA G-quadruplex binding proteins were sequestered by the expanded repeats, thousands of potential target genes with predicted G-quadruplex structures in their regulatory regions could be affected40.
An intriguing finding, which carries relevance for neurons, is that G-quadruplexes in the 3β€² UTR of mRNAs are necessary and sufficient for the localization of these mRNAs to dendrites, through interactions with proteins such as FMRP12. Whether the accumulation of the C9orf72 expanded RNA causes sequestration of proteins relevant in mRNA transport needs to be addressed, however, this highlights the possibility of RNA alterations in C9orf72 ALS/FTD that are not limited to RNA quantity and splicing defects. Therefore the study of C9orf72 ALS/FTD may need to couple quantitative RNA sequencing studies with RNA localization investigations in order to fully understand disease pathogenesis. Finally, small molecules have been identified that interact with G-quadruplexes13 and our data suggests that they may have use as potential therapeutics in ALS and FTD caused by C9orf72 repeat expansions.

Methods
 oligonucleotide sample preparation and annealing. An HPLC purified RNA oligonucleotide of sequence GGGGCCGGGGCCGGGGCCGGGGC was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and supplied as a lyophilized powder and reconstituted in ultrapure water to a stock concentration of 2.5β€…mM. We termed this sequence the C9orf72 minimal G-quadruplex repeat unit (C9Gru). Annealing was carried out by heating the samples to 90Β°C and allowing them to cool overnight to 20Β°C.NMR spectroscopyNMR data was acquired using a Bruker AVANCE 500 NMR spectrometer operating at a proton resonance frequency of 500.13β€…MHz and equipped with a QNP cryoprobe. 1D 1H NMR spectra of the RNA sample in 90%H2O/10%D2O were acquired and processed using Topspin (version 2.1, Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe) and excitation sculpting pulse sequence (Bruker pulse program zgesp). Spectra of the RNA sample were acquired before annealing in the presence of 10β€…mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and after annealing in the presence of 40β€…mM of KCl, and 10β€…mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Samples were equilibrated in both cases at a calibrated temperature of 298β€…K. Data was accumulated centered at the solvent resonance with 1024 transients over a frequency width of 10.33β€…kHz into 32β€…K data points for an acquisition time aq = 1.58β€…s with a relaxation delay d1 = 2β€…s between transients using a 90Β° radiofrequency (r.f.) pulse (p1 = 13β€…ΞΌs at a power level of 2β€…dB).Circular dichroismRNA concentrations ranged from 4.6 to 0.46β€…ΞΌM and are indicated in the results section. The following buffers were used: 40β€…mM KCl, 10β€…mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0; 50β€…mM LiCl, 10β€…mM sodium phosphate, 0.35β€…mM KCl, pH 7.0. CD experiments were performed at temperatures between 15Β°C and 95Β°C, with a 1Β°C/min temperature gradient, using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Jasco peltier temperature control system. A CD spectrum of the buffer was recorded and subtracted from the spectrum obtained for the RNA-containing solution. Data were zero-corrected between 340β€“350β€…nm.
