OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicentre, single-blind study at 51 Scandinavian centres, 505 patients aged >or= 18 years with symptoms of urinary frequency (>or= 8 micturitions/24 h) and urgency, with or without urge incontinence, were randomized to oral treatment with either tolterodine 2 mg twice daily plus simplified BT or tolterodine alone. Changes in voiding diary variables were evaluated after 2, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The patients' perceptions of their bladder symptoms and tolerability (adverse events) were also determined. RESULTS: In all, 501 patients (75% women) were evaluable on an intention-to-treat basis (244 on tolterodine + BT and 257 on tolterodine alone). Tolterodine significantly reduced the voiding frequency and increased the volume voided per void at all sample times; these effects were significantly increased by adding BT. At the end of the study the median percentage reduction in voiding frequency was greater with tolterodine + BT than with tolterodine alone (33% vs 25%, P < 0.001), while the median percentage increase in volume voided per void was 31% with tolterodine + BT and 20% with tolterodine alone (P < 0.001). There was a median of 81% fewer incontinence episodes than at baseline with tolterodine alone, which was not significantly different from that with tolterodine + BT (- 87%). The two groups had comparable median percentage reductions in urgency episodes. Some 76% of patients on tolterodine + BT reported an improvement in their bladder symptoms relative to baseline, compared with 71% on tolterodine alone. Tolterodine was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was mild dry mouth. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen.
