The results of in-patient bladder training in 65 women with frequency, urgency and urge incontinence are reported. There was a good initial response in 88%. By 6 months the response rate had fallen to 38%. Patients with sensory urgency appeared to do better than those with detrusor instability and it is suggested that bladder training may be indicated as primary treatment in sensory urgency. Eysenck Personality Inventory testing was carried out in 43 patients. The mean neuroticism score was high, with non-responders having a higher neuroticism score than responders. Patients with detrusor instability had a higher mean neuroticism score than those with sensory urgency. Introverted patients appeared to do better than extraverts with bladder training.
