OBJECTIVE: Determining the factors which influence the success of training therapy in women suffering from urinary incontinence. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Thirteen general practices in Nijmegen and environs, the Netherlands. METHOD: A total of 110 women between 20 and 65 years old, suffering from urinary incontinence were examined by their general practitioners. Age, personality, parity, psychological features and type, duration, severity, beginning of the disease, as well as the presence of cystocele or prolapse were recorded. Women were asked about their own experiences regarding factors that influenced success. The treatment consisted of training of pelvic muscles in stress incontinence and bladder training in urge incontinence. Outcomes and compliance were measured 3 and 12 months after start of treatment by means of a so-called incontinence diary. RESULTS: After 3 months the mean frequency of urine loss per week diminished from 21 to 8, and after 12 months to 6 times. Compliance was the most important contribution to success. Patients were more motivated to practise when the subjective burden of the urine loss was more severe. Other features did not influence success.
