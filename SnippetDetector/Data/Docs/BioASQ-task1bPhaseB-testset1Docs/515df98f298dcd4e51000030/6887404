<abstract>
Bladder training and/or biofeedback techniques were used to treat 75 patients with frequency, urgency, nocturia and urge incontinence. Significant improvement or cure was obtained in 70 per cent of enuretic children, and 66 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women with unstable detrusor function. The clinical results correlated with cystometric reversion to stable bladder function. Patients who obtained good results showed improvement in the tested level of psychological adjustment, suggesting that psychological factors are not causes of the urological problem.
