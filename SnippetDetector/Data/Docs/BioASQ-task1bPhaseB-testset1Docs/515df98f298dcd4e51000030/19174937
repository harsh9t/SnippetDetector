Two years after revision of the practice guideline 'Urinary incontinence' from the Dutch College of General Practitioners, it is time for a summary of the most important changes. The use of a bladder diary is recommended. In primary care, a stress test does not provide more information than history taking. Routine urodynamic testing is not indicated for patients presenting to their general practitioner with urinary incontinence. Treatment of stress, urge and mixed incontinence can usually be commenced in primary care; pelvic floor exercises and bladder training are preferred. If bladder training is not effective for urge incontinence, anticholinergic drugs should be considered. The use of oral and vaginal oestrogens and flavoxate is no longer recommended.
