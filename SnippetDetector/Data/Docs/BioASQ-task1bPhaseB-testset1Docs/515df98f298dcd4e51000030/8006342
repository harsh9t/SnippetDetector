1. Urinary incontinence is a costly and prevalent problem, affecting 15% to 39% of all community residing elders. 2. Some elders suffering from urge incontinence prefer pelvic muscle exercises to bladder training as the behavioral intervention of choice. 3. Although pelvic muscle exercises are frequently associated as an intervention for stress incontinence, they have been found to be effective in significantly reducing urge incontinence. 4. Nurses are in a key position to identify and treat urinary incontinence among the elderly, and should incorporate continence restoration interventions into their practice.
