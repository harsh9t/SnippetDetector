Anamnestic and urodynamical results are evaluated before and after bladder retraining drill (BRD) in women suffering from urge incontinence. A continence rate of 74% was determined 6 to 24 months after BRD. This agrees with dates reported by literature. Urodynamically we obtained an improvement of cystometric parameters (even in parts statistically significant). The values of the urethrocystographic angles and the urinary flow rate have been not changed. We could state that the BRD is a good possibility to realize multistep-therapy of female incontinence.
