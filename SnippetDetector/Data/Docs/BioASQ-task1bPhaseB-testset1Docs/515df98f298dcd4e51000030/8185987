BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that regular clinics might improve the management of urinary incontinence in general practice. AIM: A study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence among women in one general practice and the feasibility of using a health promotion clinic in its management. METHOD: Questionnaires were sent to a 10% sample of women aged 20 years and over on the practice register. Pregnant women were excluded. RESULTS: Of 384 questionnaires sent to eligible women, 314 were completed correctly (82%). The overall reported prevalence of urinary incontinence was 53%; 8% of these women had urge incontinence, 46% had stress incontinence and 43% had mixed incontinence. Incontinence was positively correlated with parity and with gynaecological operation other than hysterectomy and repair of prolapse but not with perineal suturing after childbirth, delivery of a baby weighing 9 lb (4.1 kg) or more or mode of delivery. Twenty seven out of 78 incontinent women (35%) who completed a second questionnaire admitted to worrying about their incontinence but only 10 (13%) had consulted their doctor about the problem. The main reason given for not consulting was that incontinence was a minor inconvenience only. The 167 incontinent women were offered an appointment at a women's clinic but only 13 attended. Of these, 10 were entered into a 12 week treatment trial. Various treatments were offered, such as the women being taught bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. One woman was lost to follow up, and for eight out of nine women their continence had improved, both subjectively and objectively. CONCLUSION: Urinary incontinence in women is a common problem. It can be successfully diagnosed and treated in general practice but low attendance makes the health promotion clinic setting an inefficient means of achieving this.
