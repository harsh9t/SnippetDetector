UNLABELLED: In a double-blinded trial, 40 male children (age 2-7 yr) undergoing circumcision were randomly assigned to receive clonidine 2 microg/kg IV or placebo after anesthetic induction. For induction and maintenance of anesthesia, we used sevoflurane as the sole anesthetic. For pain treatment, a penile block was performed before surgery. After surgery the incidence and severity of agitation was measured during an observation period of 2 h. Severe agitation was treated with midazolam. In 16 placebo and 2 clonidine-treated patients agitation was observed (P < 0.001). In 6 patients of the Placebo group, agitation was graded as severe, whereas none of the patients in the Clonidine group developed severe agitation (P = 0.02). During the postoperative period heart rate and blood pressure were significantly decreased in clonidine treated patients (P < 0.05). We conclude that clonidine effectively prevents agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: The recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia may be complicated by the presence of agitation in pediatric patients. Clonidine 2 microg/kg IV after anesthetic induction effectively reduces the incidence of agitation without resulting in clinically relevant bradycardia and hypotension.
