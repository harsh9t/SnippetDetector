BACKGROUND: This double-blind randomized study was undertaken to assess agitation, Bispectral Index (BIS) and EEG changes during induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane in children premedicated with midazolam or clonidine. METHODS: Children were allocated randomly to receive rectal midazolam 0.4 mg kg(-1) (n=20) or oral clonidine 4 microg kg(-1) (n=20) as premedication. Rapid induction of anaesthesia was achieved with inhalation of sevoflurane 8% in nitrous oxide 50%-oxygen 50%. After tracheal intubation, the children's lungs were mechanically ventilated and the inspired sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to achieve an end-tidal fraction of 2.5%. The EEG and BIS were recorded during induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation. The EEG was analysed using spectral analysis at five points: baseline, loss of eyelash reflex, 15 s before the nadir of the BIS (BIS(nadir)), when both pupils returned to the central position (immediately before intubation), and 10 min after intubation. RESULTS: Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). At baseline, EEG rhythms were slower in the clonidine group. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with similar EEG changes in the two groups, with an increase in total spectral power and a shift towards low frequencies; these changes were maximal around the end of the second minute of induction (BIS(nadir)). When the pupils had returned to the central position, fast EEG rhythms increased and BIS was higher than BIS(nadir) (P<0.05). In both groups, agitation was associated with an increase in slow EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation during sevoflurane induction. During induction with sevoflurane 8% (oxygen 50%-nitrous oxide 50%), the nadir of the BIS occurred at the end of the second minute of inhalation. Agitation was associated with a more pronounced slowing of the EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir) compared with inductions in which no agitation was observed. The BIS may not follow the depth of anaesthesia during sevoflurane induction in children.
