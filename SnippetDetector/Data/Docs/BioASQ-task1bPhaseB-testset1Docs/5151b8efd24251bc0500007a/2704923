A 40-year-old woman was admitted for investigation of weakness and angina pectoris. She had generalised weakness of muscles, cold intolerance and a reduced physical performance. A previous neurological examination had already revealed a carpal-tunnel syndrome of the right hand. This syndrome, combined with a rough, cool skin and a periorbital edema, lead to the assumption of hypothyroidism. The diagnosis was confirmed by a combination of very high concentrations of TSH and decreased concentrations of the thyroid hormones. Replacement therapy by oral administration of L-thyroxin resulted in a gradual improvement of the patient's state.
