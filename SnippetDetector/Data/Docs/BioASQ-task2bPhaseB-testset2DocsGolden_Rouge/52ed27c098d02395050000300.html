Thyroid hormone treatment of Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes attenuates the fetal gene expression and induces differentiation.
Liganded T3 receptor (TR) regulates cell autonomous formation of adult intestinal progenitor cells and that T3 action in the connective tissue is important for the establishment of the stem cell niche.
In the intestinal epithelium, TRΞ±1 and TRΞ²2 are expressed at the level of  stem/progenitor cell populations where they induce cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively.
Thyroid hormone is implicated in neural stem cell function and differentiation and acts as a neurogenic switch in the adult neural stem cell niche.
Furthermore, thyroid hormone enhances maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.
Thyroid hormones also induce hemopoietic pluripotent stem cell differentiation toward erythropoiesis and  c-erbA/TR appears to act as a binary switch affecting erythroid cell fate: unliganded c-erbA/TR supports growth while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR induces differentiation.
Finally, thyroid hormone modulates late differentiation stages of mesenchymal stem cells chondrogenesis via BMP signaling.
