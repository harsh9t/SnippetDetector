MedSim uses functional annotations of known disease genes for assessing the similarity of diseases as well as the disease relevance of candidate genes.
Hus, comparing the similarity between experimentally identified phenotypes and the phenotypes associated with human diseases can be used to suggest causal genes underlying a disease.
Among these, network-based approaches are recently proposed and outperformed functional annotation-based ones.
Given a query list, GeneMANIA extends the list with functionally similar genes that it identifies using available genomics and proteomics data.
We present a multi-view approach to retrieve biomedical knowledge using different controlled vocabularies.
We describe a bioinformatics approach, together with a freely accessible, interactive and flexible software termed Endeavour, to prioritize candidate genes underlying biological processes or diseases, based on their similarity to known genes involved in these phenomena.
We present an approach to prioritize single nucleotide polymorphisms for further follow-up in genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes.
The random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm is considered to be a state-of-the-art approach, but the modularity principle has not been fully considered in traditional RWR approaches.
