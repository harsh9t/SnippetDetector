Increased risk was found only for use of the NMT system.
Some studies show increasing incidence of brain tumours whereas other studies do not.
There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use.
This increased HR was based on results for astrocytoma WHO grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme).
Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high cumulative use of wireless phones was found.
Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in the international INTERPHONE analyses.
No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone.
After 1983 and during the period with increasing prevalence of mobile phone users, the incidence has remained relatively stable for both men and women.
