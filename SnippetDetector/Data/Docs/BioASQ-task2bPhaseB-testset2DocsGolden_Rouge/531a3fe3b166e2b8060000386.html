Infection with influenza virus during pregnancy poses a significant risk of complications for both mother and fetus.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of fetal death.
Pregnant women might thus be at increased risk of complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection, and illness may progress rapidly.
We compared outcomes between women who did and did not receive an H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between maternal H1N1 vaccination and fetal and neonatal outcomes among singleton births during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: H1N1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications.
INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is rarely reported as an extra-pulmonary manifestation of influenza while pregnancy is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy.
The A H1N1 influenza is a novel strain of the influenza A virus and is widely known as swine flu.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza infection and obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
Although influenza is usually a self-limited disease, patients who develop complications are at increased risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and death.
The Influenza A H1N1 pandemic occurred between June 2009 and August 2010.
