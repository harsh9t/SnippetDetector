The lunar cycle seems to affect the incidence of intracranial aneurysm rupture, with the new moon being associated with an increased risk of aneurysmal SAH.
Recently, it has been reported that moon phases correlate with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), however, another author found no such association.
The moon influences neither the incidence of aneurysmal SAH nor the grade of initial neurological deterioration or amount of subarachnoid blood.
We did not observe any significant impact of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in 717 consecutive patients (p=0.
84).
