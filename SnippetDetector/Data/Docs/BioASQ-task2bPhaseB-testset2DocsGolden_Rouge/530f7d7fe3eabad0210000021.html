His CNS symptoms improved dramatically after administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone tartrate (TRH-T).
(PMID: 8437381) Despite the correction of these metabolic disorders, the patient became comatose, and MRI, on T2 weighted image, showed hyperintense signals in the basal ganglia consistent with extra-pontine myelinolysis.
The patient's state remained unchanged for six weeks.
Since S.
Konno and H.
Wakui published cases of myelinolysis who dramatically improved after TRH treatment, the patient was given 0.
6 mg i.
v daily of TRH for six weeks.
Improvement began within a few days, and continued until complete recovery.
(PMID: 9773038) A 46-year-old female motorcyclist, who suffered injuries to the brain stem in a traffic accident, showed hypotensive and bradycardiac responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given to counter consciousness disturbance.
(PMID: 1394244) These results indicate that in comatose patients, the hemodynamic effects of TRH may differ depending on impairments in the central nervous system; the results support previous reports indicating a mediation of the central sympathetic nervous system in the development of pressor effects of TRH.
