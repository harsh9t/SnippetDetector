Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a central and well-studied trafficking process in eukaryotic cells.
Macromolecules gain access to the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells using one of several ways of which clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the most researched.
Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) are formed at the plasma membrane and act as vectors for endocytosis.
They also assemble at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but their exact function at this organelle is unclear.
Clathrin immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting showed increased immunoreactivity of clathrin protein in the placental tissues of mice treated with 20- and 50-nm gold nanoparticles; clathrin immunopositivity was observed in syncytiotrophoblasts and fetal endothelial cells.
Tubulobulbar complexes are elaborate clathrin/actin related structures that form at sites of intercellular attachment in the seminiferous epithelium of the mammalian testis.
We reported the first small molecule inhibitors of the interaction between the clathrin N-terminal domain (TD) and endocyctic accessory proteins (i.
e.
, clathrin inhibition1).
