However, the possibility of abortion due to MTX use remains.
Nonetheless, pregnancies in most autoimmune diseases are still classified as high risk because of the potential for major complications.
Women with RA had an increased risk of LBW, SGA babies, preeclampsia and CS compared with unaffected women.
Most pregnancies in women with rheumatologic disease will result in the delivery of a healthy baby.
A significant increase in frequency and number of cesarean deliveries, besides a higher number of pregnancies with preeclampsia, were found after RA onset.
In general, active inflammation from rheumatic diseases poses a stronger threat to the well-being of both mother and foetus than many immunosuppressant medications.
Women with SLE, RA, and pregestational DM had significantly increased rates of hypertensive disorders compared with the general obstetric population (23.
2%, 11.
1%, 27.
4%, and 7.
8%, respectively), longer hospital stays, and significantly higher risk of cesarean delivery.
These complications include disease exacerbations during gestation and increased perinatal mortality and morbidity in most autoimmune diseases,.
In this uncontrolled study we failed to demonstrate tertogenicity of MTX.
