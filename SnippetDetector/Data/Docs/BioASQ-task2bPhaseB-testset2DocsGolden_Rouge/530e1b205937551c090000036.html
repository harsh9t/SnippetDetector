Although these results are not statistically significant, a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of telephones.
Some studies show increasing incidence of brain tumours whereas other studies do not.
There was a tendency of a shorter tumour induction period for ipsilateral exposure to microwaves than for contralateral, which may indicate a tumour promotor effect.
Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in the international INTERPHONE analyses.
The meta-analysis gave for glioma in the most exposed part of the brain, the temporal lobe, odds ratio (OR)=1.
71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.
04-2.
81 in the β‰¥10 years (>10 years in the Hardell group) latency group.
For astrocytoma and ipsilateral use the trend was for analogue phones OR=1.
10, 95% CI=1.
02-1.
19, digital phones OR=1.
11, 95% CI=1.
01-1.
22, and cordless phones OR=1.
09, 95% CI=1.

Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high cumulative use of wireless phones was found.
