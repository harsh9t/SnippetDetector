In this study, we analyze new wild-derived lines of this short-lived species.
Short lifespan is tied with explosive growth and accelerated sexual maturation.
Lifespan and expression of age-related markers can be modulated by water temperature.
Genetic and pharmacological research on aging is hampered by the lifespan of available vertebrate models.
We recently initiated studies on Nothobranchius furzeri, a species with a maximum life expectancy in captivity of just three months which represents the shortest documented captive lifespan for a vertebrate.
It is very close to the Japanese Medaka, and close to the pufferfishes and stickleback and might represent a very useful model for comparative genomics of aging.
Finally, different populations or species of Nothobranchius show large-scale differences in captive lifespan.
In the last three years, N.
furzeri has moved from biological curiosity to a promising model system for drug validation.
Aging-related genes can be easily isolated by homology cloning.
In the inbred laboratory line, DR reduced age-related risk and prolonged maximum life span.
The short-lived annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri shows extremely short captive life span and accelerated expression of age markers, making it an interesting model system to investigate the effects of experimental manipulations on longevity and age-related pathologies.
