We propose the incorporation of chromatin insulators in the design of gene therapy vectors to overcome the problem of position effects.
Chromatin insulators are protein-binding DNA elements that lack intrinsic promoter/enhancer activity but shelter genes from transcriptional influence of surrounding chromatin.
