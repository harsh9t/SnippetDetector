There is increased obstetrical and neonatal morbidity.
Women with RA had an increased risk of LBW, SGA babies, preeclampsia and CS compared with unaffected women.
Women with  RA appear to have a higher age-adjusted risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy and longer hospital stays than do pregnant women in the general population, and careful antenatal monitoring should be performed.
Patients with rheumatic disease can have successful pregnancy outcomes, particularly when a collaborative approach between the rheumatologist and obstetrician is applied.
In general, active inflammation from rheumatic diseases poses a stronger threat to the well-being of both mother and foetus than many immunosuppressant medications.
Therefore, continued immunosuppression with the least risky medications will allow for the most optimal pregnancy outcomes.
