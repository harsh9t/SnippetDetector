a novel class of selective Tpl2 kinase inhibitors: 4-Alkylamino-[1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles  Initial 4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitrile leads showed poor selectivity for Tpl2   We have discovered that 8-halo-4-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenylamino)-6-[(1H-[1,2,3]triazol-4-ylmethyl)-amino]-quinoline-3-carbonitriles (4) are potent inhibitors of this enzyme  report here the synthesis and SAR of a new series of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines as potent Tpl2 kinase inhibitors.
