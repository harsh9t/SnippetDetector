The PcG proteins are well-conserved chromatin factors that repress transcription of numerous target genes.
They bind the genome at specific sites, forming chromatin domains of associated histone modifications as well as higher-order chromatin structures.
(PMID: 23694722)  Here we show that the HSV DNA first associates with histone H3, with later recruitment of Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and trimethylation of the lysine 27 residue of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with heterochromatin (PMID: 23322639) Here we show that direct recognition of methylated histone H3 Lys36 (H3K36me), a mark associated with activation, by the PRC2 subunit Phf19 is required for the full enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex (PMID: 23104054).
