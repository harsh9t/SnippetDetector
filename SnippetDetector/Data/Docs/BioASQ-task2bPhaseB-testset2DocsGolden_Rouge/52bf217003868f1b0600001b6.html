The short-lived annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri shows extremely short captive life span and accelerated expression of age markers, making it an interesting model system to investigate the effects of experimental manipulations on longevity and age-related pathologies.
(PMID: 19302373) It is very close to the Japanese Medaka, and close to the pufferfishes and stickleback and might represent a very useful model for comparative genomics of aging.
(PMID: 17049789) These fishes can become excellent models for aging studies.
They can be employed to test the effects of experimental manipulation on aging at a pace comparable with that of Drosophila and to probe the effects of natural selection on the evolution of aging-related genes.
(PMID: 16164422) Owing to large differences in aging phenotypes in different lines, N.
furzeri could represent a model system for studying the genetic control of life-history traits in natural populations.
(PMID: 19052641) In the last three years, N.
furzeri has moved from biological curiosity to a promising model system for drug validation.
