This paper compares corresponding non-MHC genomic regions identified in rodent and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
To date, over 30 non-MHC RA-associated loci have been identified in humans, and over 100 arthritis-associated loci have been identified in rodent models of RA  The most relevant non-HLA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA include PTPN22, IL23R, TRAF1, CTLA4, IRF5, STAT4, CCR6, PADI4.
Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 30 loci involved in RA pathogenesis.
