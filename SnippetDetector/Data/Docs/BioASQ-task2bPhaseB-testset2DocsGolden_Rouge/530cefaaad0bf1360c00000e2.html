There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in the UK.
Latest results from the UK trials evaluating prostate cancer screening and treatment: the CAP and ProtecT studies.
To examine the pattern of use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in a UK region, where National Health Service policy does not recommend screening for prostate cancer.
We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening test for prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS.
