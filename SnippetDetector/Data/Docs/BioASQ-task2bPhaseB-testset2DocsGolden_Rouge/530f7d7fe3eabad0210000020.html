Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone and its analogs are used for treatment of comatose patients.
In animal models, Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone and its analogs have been shown to improve the disturbance of consciousness caused by head concussion and pentobarbital.
This analeptic action is attributable to stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the septo-hippocampal area and to the presence of terminals containing TRH in the lateral septum and TRH receptors concentrated especially in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca.
It has also been suggested that TRH localized in the pineal gland has a part in activating the neuronal mechanisms of arousal.
Associated with the arousal effect and especially evident in variously originated shock conditions are the activating effects of TRH on vegetative functions (body temperature, circulation, the gastrointestinal tract).
These stimulatory activities on the CNS were the rationale for therapeutic use of TRH in the initial treatment of coma due to brain trauma.
Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone has been shown to induce recovery in comatose patients with extrapontine and pontine myelinosis syndromes.
