Pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 involves interaction with the ATP-binding site of the chaperone.
This exerts antiproliferative effects resulting in a marked suppression of tumor growth.
Following treatment with a Hsp90 inhibitor, expression of a number of proteins is affected, and most notably the Hsp90 clients, leading to dysregulation of intracellular signal transduction, immune response, cell growth and maintenance, transport, and metabolism, finally resulting in cancer cell death through activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.
