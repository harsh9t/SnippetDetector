Lumbosacral transitional vertebra is an anatomical variation of the fifth lumbar vertebra in which an enlarged transverse process can form a joint or fusion with the sacrum or ilium.
The association of that variant with low back pain and the change in the biomechanical properties of the lumbar spine is called Bertolotti s syndrome.
Bertolotti s syndrome (BS), a form of lumbago in lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, is an important cause of low back pain in young patients.
