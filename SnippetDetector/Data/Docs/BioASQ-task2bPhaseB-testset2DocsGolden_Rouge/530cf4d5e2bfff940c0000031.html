novel quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives as Tpl2 kinase inhibitors  ynthesis, modeling and structure-activity relationship of indazoles as inhibitors of Tpl2 kinase are described  Initial 4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitrile leads showed poor selectivity for Tpl2   a novel class of selective Tpl2 kinase inhibitors: 4-Alkylamino-[1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles   selectivity and in vivo antiinflammatory activity of novel 8-substituted-4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitriles  report here the synthesis and SAR of a new series of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines as potent Tpl2 kinase inhibitors  identified a novel series of 2,4-disubstituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridines as COT kinase inhibitors  The 8-substituted-4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitriles were prepared from the appropriate 2-substituted 4-nitroanilines.
