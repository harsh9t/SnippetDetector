It has been suggested that overexpression and even amplification of ERBB2 may play a role in the development of prostate cancer.
An anti-ERBB2 antibody, trastuzumab, has been shown to be highly efficient in the treatment of metastatic breast cancers overexpressing the ERBB2 gene.
The human epidermal growth factor receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases is part of a network of pathways that are involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer.
We studied a recombinant, humanized anti-Her-2 / neu antibody in preclinical models of human prostate cancer.
INTRODUCTION: Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 overexpression supports proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer ( PC ).
Our previous results have indicated the relevance of Her2 in the transition of the androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells.
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER-2 receptor and has antitumor activity in patients with HER-2-overexpressing breast carcinoma.
PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and toxicity of the antibody to the HER-2 / neu receptor in the treatment of advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ).
These results suggest the utility of Herceptin in the treatment of human prostate cancer.
In the present study, we evaluate the antitumor effects of docetaxel combined with trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 antibody.
