TREM2 mutations are the genetic basis for a condition characterized by polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy and an early-onset dementia syndrome.
This study replicates the association between R47H and Alzheimer's disease risk in a large, population-based sample, and estimates the population frequency and attributable risk of this rare variant.
Variants in TREM2 triple one's risk of developing late-onset AD.
We observed an enrichment of rare variants across TREM2 in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, most notably in the extracellular IgV-set domain; p = 0.

The rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease ( AD ).
These data demonstrate that TREM2 coding region is highly conserved, implying a crucial role of this receptor.
TREM2 has been reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
Here, we evaluated TREM2 mRNA and protein expressions in peripheral blood from AD patients and healthy controls.
Two recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease.
