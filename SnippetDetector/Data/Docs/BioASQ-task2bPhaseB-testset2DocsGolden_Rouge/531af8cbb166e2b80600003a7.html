CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance.
Previous studies demonstrate that 6 of the established non-HLA CD and RA risk loci (out of 26 loci for each disease) are shared between both diseases.
A total of 47 candidate regions were identified.
The meta-analysis results showed that: (1) 30, 28 and 26 SNPs were significantly associated with RA (P<0.
01) for the allele, dominant, and recessive models, respectively.
The most relevant non-HLA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA include PTPN22, IL23R, TRAF1, CTLA4, IRF5, STAT4, CCR6, PADI4.
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) added about 10 new loci to the list of already more than 20 loci associated with RA, so the list is now over 30.
Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role.
We successfully identified 41 significant SNPs relevant to RA, 25 associated genes and a number of important SNP-SNP interactions (SNP patterns).
