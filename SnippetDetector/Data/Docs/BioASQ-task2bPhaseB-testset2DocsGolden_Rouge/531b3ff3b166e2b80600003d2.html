EGF-mediated EMT  One such pathway involves TGFΞ²-induced phosphorylation of Par6  We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT  Recently, we showed that Numb is capable of binding to both Par3 and E-cadherin  conserved polarity proteins Par6 and aPKC regulate cell polarization processes  This is coupled with the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, often mediated by Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb1/deltaEF1.
This appeared fundamentally different to the EGF-induced EMT, highlighting the multiple pathways which can regulate EMT  We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1  TGFbeta has pleiotropic effects that range from regulation of proliferation and apoptosis to morphological changes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
