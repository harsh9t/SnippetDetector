H1N1 vaccination was strongly associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy-cataplexy in both children and adults in France (PMID: 23884811) Although no formal link can be established, the unusual characteristics of the reported cases and the striking temporal relationship suggests that narcolepsy may be the result of an autoimmune reaction triggered by H1N1 vaccination in susceptible individuals.
(PMID: 21676420) The proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility.
(PMID: 24048081) Recently identified autoantibodies to Tribbles homologue 2 in some patients, as well as cases associated with H1N1 vaccination, support an autoimmune mechanism.
