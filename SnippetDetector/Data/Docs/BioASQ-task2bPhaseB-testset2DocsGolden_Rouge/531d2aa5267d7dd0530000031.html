Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously healthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise.
The release of BNP during and after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have cytoprotective and growth-regulating effects.
The different nature of exercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in the future.
