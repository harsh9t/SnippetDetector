Clinical trials have also suggested that LCM is a safe, effective, and well tolerated adjunctive treatment for reduction of seizure frequency in patients with highly refractory, partial seizures.
It has shown potent and broad neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo animal models making it a potential candidate for long term treatment of epilepsy.
In addition to this, it has demonstrated analgesic activity in various animal models.
The current article presents a concise review of network theory and its application to the characterization of AED use in children with refractory epilepsy.
Recent results suggest that LCM has a dual mode of action underlying its anticonvulsant and analgesic activity.
Apart from this, LCM has demonstrated potent effects in animal models for a variety of CNS disorders like schizophrenia and stress induced anxiety.
LCM has demonstrated antiepileptic effectiveness in different rodent seizure models and antinociceptive potential in experimental animal models that reflect distinct types and symptoms of neuropathic as well as chronic inflammatory pain.
