Concordantly, edaravone has been found to have neuroprotective effects in a number of animal models of disease, including stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors.
(PMID: 22977573) Under specific experimental conditions, edaravone minimized traumatic brain injury by functioning as a synthetic antioxidant.
(PMID: 17115943) Edaravone administration inhibited production of free radicals known to induce neuronal degeneration and cell death after brain injury, and protected nestin-positive cells, including NSCs, with the potential to differentiate into neurons and glia around the area damaged by TBI.
(PMID: 19590930)  Edaravone gives good therapeutic effect on severe TBI, and the molecular mechanism is related to attenuation of ERK1/2 pathway and neuronal apoptosis following severe brain trauma.
