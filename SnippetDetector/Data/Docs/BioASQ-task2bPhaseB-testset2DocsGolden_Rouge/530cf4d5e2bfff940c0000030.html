[1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles and quinoline-3-carbonitriles were the first Tumor Progression Loci-2 (Tpl2) kinase inhibitors.
4-alkylamino-[1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles are also known to inhibit Tpl2 function as well as quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives, thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines and 2,4-disubstituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridines, indazoles, 4-Alkylamino-[1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles and generally molecules belonging to the wide categories of quinoline-3-carbonitriles, indazoles and thieno-pyrimidines.
