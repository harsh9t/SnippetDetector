Therapies that used capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and clonazepam were those that showed more reduction in symptoms of BMS.
The concomitant prescription of tongue protector and AV is effective for treating patients with BMS.
The systemic administration of Catuama reduces the symptoms of BMS and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease.
We suggest that a subset of patients with BMS may be a phenotypic variant of RLS and a trial of dopaminergic drugs should be given in patients with BMS who has a history suggestive of RLS or in a patient who do not show a response to usual therapies for BMS.
On average, treatment with placebos produced a response that was 72% as large as the response to active drugs.
Topical clonazepam, which previous analyses of clinical evidence have shown to be the drug of choice for BMS, also proved to be the most cost-effective of the drugs analysed for this condition.
