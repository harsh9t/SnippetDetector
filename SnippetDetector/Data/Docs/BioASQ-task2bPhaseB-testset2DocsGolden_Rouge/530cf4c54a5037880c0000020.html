Yes.
The use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure for noninvasive respiratory support of preterm infants after extubation.
However, the use of high-flow nasal cannulae in preterm infants was shown to be associated with a higher rate of reintubation, increased exposure to oxygen and longer duration of respiratory support.
High-flow nasal cannulae are also effective for treatment of apnea of prematurity.
