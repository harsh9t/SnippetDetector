Oxantel is an anthelmintic.
It has typically been used human and animal use as a standard treatment for intestinal worms.
Oxantel is currently being experimented with for the treatment of periodontal disease by the Cooperative Research Centre for Oral Health Science (CRC).
Fumarate reductase is an enzyme that has been found in the pathogenic bacteria in the biofilm in periodontal pockets.
This bacteria has the ability to convert blood components into energy and for the bacteria to be virulent.
Such bacteria would starve without this enzyme.
As such, the role of the Oxantel as a fumarate reductase inhibitor would be to kill the bacteria responsible for periodontal disease.
(Wikipedia) Oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens (PMID: 24165189) The anthelmintic drug oxantel has been shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (Frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit P.
gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation.
(PMID: 24165189) Oxantel, a cholinergic anthelmintic and fumarate reductase inhibitor, significantly inhibited biofilm formation by P.
gingivalis and disrupted established biofilms at concentrations below its MIC against planktonic cells.
