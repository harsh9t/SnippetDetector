Depression is common affecting up to 40% of caregivers of brain tumor patients.
Depression is associated with poor quality of life of caregivers of brain tumor patients.
Greater anxiety, patientsβ€™ emotional distress, economic hardship, lower caregiversβ€™ age, lower income, less social support and lower patient functioning were associated with more caregiversβ€™ depressive symptoms.
Reports of caregiver depressive symptoms were lower when paired with higher reports of spirituality.
It is important to monitor and treat caregiver's depression.
