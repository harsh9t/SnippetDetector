Identification of ancient biological samples from the 1991-discovered and more than 5300-year-old Tyrolean mummy, also called iceman or Oetzi, is very difficult.
Paleoproteomic study of the Iceman's brain tissue.
To determine whether a 2,700-year-old tumor can be reliably diagnosed using microscopic and proteomic techniques.
We report the first use of shotgun proteomics to detect the protein expression profile of buccal swabs and cloth samples from two 500-year-old Andean mummies.
