Oxantel, a cholinergic anthelmintic and fumarate reductase inhibitor, significantly inhibited biofilm formation by P.
gingivalis and disrupted established biofilms at concentrations below its MIC against planktonic cells.
He anthelmintic drug oxantel has been shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (Frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit P.
gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation.
Oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens.
