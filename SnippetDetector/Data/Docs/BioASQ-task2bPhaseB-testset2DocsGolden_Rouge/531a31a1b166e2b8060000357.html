non-synonymous genetic rare variant, rs75932628-T (p.
R47H), in the TREM2 gene has recently been reported to be a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (PMID: 24041969) A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland (PMID: 23150908) Moreover, a rare TREM2 exon 2 variant (p.
R47H) was reported to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an odds ratio as strong as that for APOEe4 (PMID: 24119542) Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease through impaired containment of inflammatory processes (PMID: 23150908).
