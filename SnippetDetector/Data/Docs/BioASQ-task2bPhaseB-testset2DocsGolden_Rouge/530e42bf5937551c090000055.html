Lastly, edaravone treatment significantly reduced the presence of inflammatory cytokines, cerebral edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and, importantly, neurological deficits following TBI.
Our results suggest that edaravone exerts a neuroprotective effect in the rat model of TBI.
The likely mechanism is via inhibiting oxidative stress, leading to a decreased inflammatory response and glial activation, and thereby reducing neuronal death and improving neurological function.
