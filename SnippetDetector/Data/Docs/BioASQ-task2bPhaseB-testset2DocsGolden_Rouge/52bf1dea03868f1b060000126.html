Treated horses responded normally to external stimuli, retained their appetites, and performed appropriately when ridden.
Adverse experiences included nausea, dizziness, and insomnia.
These included most notably fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea and vomiting.
In the second study, six healthy men were initially administered a single 50-mg dose of drug, and plasma samples were obtained at selected time intervals for 48 hours.
Plasma samples were collected immediately before each dose and at selected times for up to 48 hours after the last dose.
Sedation wore off during the course of prolonged infusions.
A dosing schedule of 20 mg q12h was then started and continued for seven days.
Nalmefene also caused slight increases in self-rated alertness, and decreases in ratings of tiredness and elation, although it was thought unlikely that these accounted for observed changes in eating behaviour.
The nalmefene treated group ate 22% less, both in terms of absolute weight and caloric intake, of a standardised buffet-meal than did the placebo group.
