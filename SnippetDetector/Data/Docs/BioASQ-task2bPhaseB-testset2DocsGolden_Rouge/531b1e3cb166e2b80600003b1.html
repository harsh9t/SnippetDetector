Here we show that the HSV DNA first associates with histone H3, with later recruitment of Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and trimethylation of the lysine 27 residue of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with heterochromatin  The PcG proteins are well-conserved chromatin factors that repress transcription of numerous target genes.
They bind the genome at specific sites, forming chromatin domains of associated histone modifications as well as higher-order chromatin structures.
