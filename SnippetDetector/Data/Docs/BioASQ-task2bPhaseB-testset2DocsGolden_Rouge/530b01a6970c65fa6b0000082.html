The use of mass calibrants (lock masses) to reduce the systematic error of mass-to-charge measurements has also been reported and, in some cases, incorporated in the instrument control software by the instrument manufacturers.
To compensate for drifts in instrument calibration, a compound of known mass is often employed.
This  lock mass  provides an internal mass standard in every spectrum.
