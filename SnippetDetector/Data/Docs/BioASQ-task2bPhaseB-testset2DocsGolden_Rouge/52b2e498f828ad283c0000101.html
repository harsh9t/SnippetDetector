Achondroplasia comes from the genetic point mutations in the fibroblastic growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which enables abnormal cartilage growth-plate differentiation and insufficient bony development.
The most common genetic mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A), which result in the substitution of glycine to arginine at codon 380.
