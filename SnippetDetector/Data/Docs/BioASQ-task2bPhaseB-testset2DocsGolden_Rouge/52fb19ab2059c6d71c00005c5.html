Most pregnancies in women with rheumatologic disease will result in the delivery of a healthy baby.
Women with RA may be at higher risk for preterm delivery.
In this uncontrolled study we failed to demonstrate tertogenicity of MTX.
Nonetheless, pregnancies in most autoimmune diseases are still classified as high risk because of the potential for major complications.
There is increased obstetrical and neonatal morbidity in Canadian women with RA or SLE.
However, the possibility of abortion due to MTX use remains.
Of 78 JIA pregnancies, 53 (68%) were delivered by either Caesarean section (n = 40, 51%) or instrumental delivery (n = 13, 17%); compared with other women, those with JIA had significantly higher rates of pre-eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage and severe maternal morbidity.
Women with SLE, RA, and pregestational DM had significantly increased rates of hypertensive disorders compared with the general obstetric population (23.
2%, 11.
1%, 27.
4%, and 7.
8%, respectively), longer hospital stays, and significantly higher risk of cesarean delivery.
