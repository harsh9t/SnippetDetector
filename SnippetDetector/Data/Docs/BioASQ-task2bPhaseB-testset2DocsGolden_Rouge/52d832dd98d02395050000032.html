Members of the protein kinase CK1 family usually phosphorylate residues of serine that are close to other phosphoserine in a consensus motif of pS-X-X-S,  The protein kinase CK1 phosphorylates serine residues that are located close to another phosphoserine in the consensus pSer-Xaa-Xaa-Ser.
a novel consensus phosphorylation motif (K/R-X-K/R-X-X-S/T) for CK1   CK1 acts as a  phosphate-directed  kinase whose targeting is primed by a single phosphorylated side chain at position n-3 or n-4 relative to serine/threonine  The results demonstrate that SLS and acidic cluster motifs are crucial for CK1 recognition.
The common features include an SLS motif followed two to five residues downstream by a cluster of acidic residues.
These data provide the clear-cut demonstration that the consensus sequence with N-terminal prephosphorylated residue(s), SerP/ThrP-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr.
