Previous linkage studies have indicated that susceptibility loci for the disease are located on chromosomes 3p, 6q, and 17q.
In the present study, we searched for loci linked to the disease in 12 Japanese families using 428 microsatellite markers and found significant evidence for linkage to 8q23 [maximum LOD score (MLS) of 3.
6] and suggestive evidence for linkage to 12p12 (MLS=2.
3).
