Nonetheless, pregnancies in most autoimmune diseases are still classified as high risk because of the potential for major complications.
In this uncontrolled study we failed to demonstrate tertogenicity of MTX.
Additionally, four newborns with congenital anomalies were reported after the disease onset compared to none before RA onset.
These complications include disease exacerbations during gestation and increased perinatal mortality and morbidity in most autoimmune diseases,.
Compared with other infants, those with mothers with JIA were more likely to be born prematurely, but were not at increased risk of being small for gestational age, requiring neonatal intensive care, having a low Apgar score at 5 min or severe neonatal morbidity.
However, the possibility of abortion due to MTX use remains.
Women with SLE, RA, and pregestational DM had significantly increased rates of hypertensive disorders compared with the general obstetric population (23.
2%, 11.
1%, 27.
4%, and 7.
8%, respectively), longer hospital stays, and significantly higher risk of cesarean delivery.
Women with RA may be at higher risk for preterm delivery.
