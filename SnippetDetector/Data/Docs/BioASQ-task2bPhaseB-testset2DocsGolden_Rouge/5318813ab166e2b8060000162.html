A genetic deficiency of PCC activity causes propionic acidemia, a potentially fatal disease with onset in severe cases in the newborn period.
Affected patients may have mutations of either the PCCA or PCCB gene.
PCC consists of two subunits, alpha and beta, encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively.
Inherited PCC deficiency due to mutations in either gene results in propionic acidemia (PA),.
