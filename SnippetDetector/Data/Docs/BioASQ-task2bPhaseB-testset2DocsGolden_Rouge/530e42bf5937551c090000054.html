Edaravone administration inhibited production of free radicals known to induce neuronal degeneration and cell death after brain injury, and protected nestin-positive cells, including NSCs, with the potential to differentiate into neurons and glia around the area damaged by TBI.
Free-radical scavenger edaravone treatment confers neuroprotection against traumatic brain injury in rats.
Under specific experimental conditions, edaravone minimized traumatic brain injury by functioning as a synthetic antioxidant.
Concordantly, edaravone has been found to have neuroprotective effects in a number of animal models of disease, including stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors.
