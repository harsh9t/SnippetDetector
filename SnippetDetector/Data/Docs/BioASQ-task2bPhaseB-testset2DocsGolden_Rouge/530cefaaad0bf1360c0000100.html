Yes, pesticide exposure is associated with delayed polyneuropathy.
Electrophysiological studies have revealed three characteristic phenomena: (i) repetitive firing following a single stimulus; (ii) gradual reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential followed by an increase with repetitive stimulation (the 'decrement-increment response'); and (iii) continued reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential with repetitive simulation ('decrementing response').
Pesticide exposure was also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, suicide attempts and affective disorders.
