In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity.
Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups.
(PMID: 17636722) However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated.
In conclusion, the multiplicity and the possible reversibility of subclinical hypothyroidism-associated cardiovascular abnormalities suggest that the decision to treat a patient should depend on the presence of risk factors, rather than on a TSH threshold.
