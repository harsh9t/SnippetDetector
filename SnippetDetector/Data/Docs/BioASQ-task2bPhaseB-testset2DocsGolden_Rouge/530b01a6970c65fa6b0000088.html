To compensate for drifts in instrument calibration, a compound of known mass is often employed.
This 'lock mass' provides an internal mass standard in every spectrum.
(PMID: 21953191) The use of mass calibrants (lock masses) to reduce the systematic error of mass-to-charge measurements has also been reported and, in some cases, incorporated in the instrument control software by the instrument manufacturers.
(PMID: 21133379) We achieved absolute mass accuracies for intact proteins between 0.
92 and 2.
8 ppm using the "lock mass" mode of operation.
(PMID: 16478717) Real time recalibration on the "lock mass" by corrections of mass shift removes mass error associated with calibration of the mass scale.
(PMID: 16249172) Benzyldimethylphenylammonium was used as an internal lock mass.
(PMID: 22941912).
