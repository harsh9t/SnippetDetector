Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after traumatic brain injury.
Preliminary studies have suggested that amantadine may promote functional recovery.
Amantadine accelerated the pace of functional recovery during active treatment in patients with post-traumatic disorders of consciousness.
During the 4-week treatment period, recovery was significantly faster in the amantadine group than in the placebo group, as measured by the DRS score (difference in slope, 0.
24 points per week; P=0.
007), indicating a benefit with respect to the primary outcome measure.
(PMID: 22375973) Higher exposure of amantadine (average concentration of amantadine during 6 mg/kg/day > 1.
5 mg/L) may be associated with better recovery of consciousness.
