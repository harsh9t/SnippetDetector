Recent results suggest that LCM has a dual mode of action underlying its anticonvulsant and analgesic activity.
The current article presents a concise review of network theory and its application to the characterization of AED use in children with refractory epilepsy.
LCM has demonstrated antiepileptic effectiveness in different rodent seizure models and antinociceptive potential in experimental animal models that reflect distinct types and symptoms of neuropathic as well as chronic inflammatory pain.
Currently, LCM is in a late stage of clinical development as an adjunctive treatment for patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, and it is being assessed as monotherapy in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.
In addition to this, it has demonstrated analgesic activity in various animal models.
Apart from this, LCM has demonstrated potent effects in animal models for a variety of CNS disorders like schizophrenia and stress induced anxiety.
Clinical trials have also suggested that LCM is a safe, effective, and well tolerated adjunctive treatment for reduction of seizure frequency in patients with highly refractory, partial seizures.
