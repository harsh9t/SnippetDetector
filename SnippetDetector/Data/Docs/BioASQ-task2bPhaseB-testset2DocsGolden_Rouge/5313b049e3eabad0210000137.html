Herceptin is widely used in treating Her2-overexpressing breast cancer.
However, the application of Herceptin in prostate cancer is still controversial.
Our data demonstrate that Re-188-labeled Herceptin effectively inhibited the growth of DU145 cells compared to the Herceptin- and Re-188-treated cohorts.
This implies that targeting Her2 by both radio- and immuno- therapy might be a potential strategy for treating patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer.
(PMID: 23294030) trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 receptor; immunotoxin conjugates use an antibody directed against EGFR joined to a cell toxin.
All are in clinical trials for a number of cancers, including prostate cancer (PMID: 11502465).
