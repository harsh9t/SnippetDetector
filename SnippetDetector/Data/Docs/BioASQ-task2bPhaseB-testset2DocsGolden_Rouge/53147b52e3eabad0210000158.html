Severe G6PDd was associated with considerable higher risk of malaria-related transfusions.
This may inhibit parasite growth, enhance uptake of infected RBCs by spleen macrophages, and/or cause less cytoadherence of the infected cells to capillary endothelium.
In conclusion, genetic variants that confer resistance to malaria are associated with RBC traits in African-Americans.
The beneficial effect of thalassemia minor, sickle-cell trait, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency on survival of malaria infection may well be due to the shared feature of enhanced oxidative stress.
G6PD deficiency has been positively selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it also confers an advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of coronary diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity.
A central position of the PPP for malaria parasites is supported by the fact that human G6PD deficiency protects to a certain degree from malaria infections.
G6PD enzyme activity was directly related to susceptibility to malaria in the Brazilian Amazon, where P.
vivax predominates.
