Furthermore, first generation AEDs were often discontinued, while lacosamide and topiramate were most likely to be initiated.
Lacosamide (LCM) is a newer antiepileptic drug with a dual mode of action.
Recent results suggest that LCM has a dual mode of action underlying its anticonvulsant and analgesic activity.
The current article presents a concise review of network theory and its application to the characterization of AED use in children with refractory epilepsy.
Two additional AEDs, lacosamide and eslicarbazepine acetate, have been licensed recently for a more traditional indication, refractory partial-onset seizures.
Clinical trials have also suggested that LCM is a safe, effective, and well tolerated adjunctive treatment for reduction of seizure frequency in patients with highly refractory, partial seizures.
