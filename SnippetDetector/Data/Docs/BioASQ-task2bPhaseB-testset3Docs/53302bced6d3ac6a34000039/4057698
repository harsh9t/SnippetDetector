Time sequence and specificity of thyroid hormones and biochemical parameters were investigated in patients following major surgery. Serum concentration of triiodothyronine decreases significantly following operation, with a biphasic regression. There is a reciprocal change in serum reverse triiodothyronine levels, but serum thyroxine levels show no significant change after operation. The significant decrease in serum concentration of alpha-2-macroglobulin and antithrombin III during and after surgery is the result of consumption of these inhibitors because the reciprocal change in serum concentration of elastase-like protease has been recognized. According to the change of curvilinear regression of serum triiodothyronine levels, 14 patients were grouped into 3. The patients for whom the curvilinear regression resembled a polynomial of degree 3 and 2 had a good prognosis, but the remaining 4 with no significant curvilinear regression had major complications and 2 died. It is meaningful that the postoperative change of triiodothyronine levels relates to the clinical outcome, to some degree.
