Thyroid hormone status was assessed in 132 children with congenital heart defects undergoing cardiac surgery (median age 3.1 y; range 2 d to 16.2 y). Plasma TSH, thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), thyroglobulin (Tg), and urinary iodine excretion were measured before and every other day after cardiac surgery (d 1-21). After surgery we observed strikingly low plasma concentrations of TSH (0.4 mU/L; 0.2-1.3), T3 (0.6 nmol/L; 0.3-1.2), T4 (48.9 nmol/L; 12.9-82.4), IT4 (12.9 pmol/L; 5.1-19.3), and Tg (9.4 micrograms/L; 1.5-20.6), whereas rT3 plasma concentrations increased (0.13 pmol/L; 0.05-0.3; n = 40). The maximal post-operative changes of TSH and rT3 preceded changes of T3, T4, fT4, and Tg. Postoperative urinary iodine excretion increased significantly (n = 109). Thyroid hormone plasma concentrations were lowest after cardiopulmonary bypass operations and in patients treated with dopamine. In patients with postoperative T3 plasma concentrations less than 0.6 nmol/L (n =52) the period of mechanical ventilation and intensive care treatment was significantly prolonged. Furthermore, the cumulative doses of inotropic and vasoactive catecholamines and furosemide were significantly higher in this patient group. Our results demonstrate transient secondary hypothyroidism in children after cardiac surgery that may contribute to postoperative cardiac and respiratory dysfunction and may delay recovery. Possible benefits of thyroid hormone replacement therapy need to be thoroughly examined.
