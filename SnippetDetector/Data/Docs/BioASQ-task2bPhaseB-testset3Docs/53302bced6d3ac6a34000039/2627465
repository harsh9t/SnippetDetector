A significant reduction in plasma free triiodothyronine (T3) (P less than 0.0001) has been observed in patients undergoing open heart surgery. The beneficial effect of T3 would appear to be associated with increased synthesis and utilization of myocardial high energy stores. We have therefore administered T3 (4-10 micrograms iv) to 10 patients either when difficulty was being experienced in weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support (n = 5), or when myocardial function remained extremely poor (n = 5), despite inotropic and intraaortic balloon pump support. Mean preoperative NYHA functional class of the 10 patients was 3.2, left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (LVEDP) 20 mm Hg and ejection fraction (EF) 40%. The mean myocardial ischaemia time was 72 min (range 40-120 min). Within 1 h of T3 administration the mean plasma free T3 level had risen from 1.03 to 3.56 micrograms/ml and CPB was discontinued in all 5 cases. Balloon pump support (n = 2) was no longer essential within 3 h. At 1 h, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) had risen from 42 to 78 mm Hg, and heart rate (HR) from 90 to 104 beats/min; the left atrial pressure (LAP) had fallen from 30 to 14 mm Hg, and the central venous pressure (CVP) from 20 to 11 cm H2O. (All changes significant at P less than 0.0001.) Inotropic support had been significantly reduced or discontinued. To our knowledge, T3 has not been administered previously as an inotropic agent to patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. We believe that T3 may have an important role in the rescue of failing hearts following a period of myocardial ischaemia in patients who have undergone open heart surgery.
