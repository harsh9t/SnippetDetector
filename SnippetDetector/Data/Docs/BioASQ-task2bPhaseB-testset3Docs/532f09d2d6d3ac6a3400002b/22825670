Atrial fibrillation is an important cause of preventable, disabling stroke and is particularly frequent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Stage 3 CKD is an independent risk factor for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Warfarin anticoagulation is efficacious for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients with stage 3 CKD, but recent observational studies have challenged its value for patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation. Novel oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban are at least as efficacious as warfarin with reduced risks of intracranial haemorrhage. However, all these agents undergo renal clearance to varying degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in patients with CKD. Overall, the novel oral anticoagulants have performed well in randomized trials of patients with stage 3 CKD, with similar efficacy and safety profiles as for patients without CKD, albeit requiring dosing modifications. The required period of discontinuation of novel oral anticoagulants before elective surgery is longer for patients with CKD owing to their reduced renal clearance. Although much remains to be learned about the optimal use of these new agents in patients with CKD, they are attractive anticoagulation options that are likely to replace warfarin in coming years.
