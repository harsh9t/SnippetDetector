Comparative and competitive analyses of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) binding to highly purified rat liver, brain and lung cell plasma membranes were carried out. The dependence of hormone binding on the time, temperature and concentration was studied. The effects of trypsin and partial delipidation on the binding parameters of thyroid hormones were investigated. Two thyroid hormone-binding sites were detected in cell plasma membranes of all tissues under study. The maximal binding of T4 to rat liver membranes and the maximal binding of T3 to rat brain membranes was observed in all experiments, the affinity for T3 being higher than that for T4. An important role of both protein and lipid components of plasma membranes in the membrane reception of thyroid hormones is proposed.
