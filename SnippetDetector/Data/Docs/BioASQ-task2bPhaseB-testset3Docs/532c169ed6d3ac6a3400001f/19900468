Extranuclear or nongenomic effects of thyroid hormones are mediated by receptors located at the plasma membrane or inside cells, and are independent of protein synthesis. Recently the alphaVbeta3 integrin was identified as a cell membrane receptor for thyroid hormones, and a wide variety of nongenomic effects have now been shown to be induced through binding of thyroid hormones to this receptor. However, also other thyroid hormone receptors can produce nongenomic effects, including the cytoplasmic TRalpha and TRbeta receptors and probably also a G protein-coupled membrane receptor, and increasing importance is now given to thyroid hormone metabolites like 3,5-diiodothyronine and reverse T(3) that can mimick some nongenomic effects of T(3) and T(4). Signal transduction from the alphaVbeta3 integrin may proceed through at least three independent pathways (protein kinase C, Src or mitogen-activated kinases) but the details are still unknown. Thyroid hormones induce nongenomic effects on at least three important Na(+)-dependent transport systems, the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, and amino acid transport System A, leading to a mitogenic response in embryo cells; but modulation of the same transport systems may have different roles in other cells and at different developmental stages. It seems that thyroid hormones in many cases can modulate nongenomically the same targets affected by the nuclear receptors through long-term mechanisms. Recent results on nongenomic effects confirm the old theory that the primary role of thyroid hormones is to keep the steady-state level of functioning of the cell, but more and more mechanisms are discovered by which this goal can be achieved.
