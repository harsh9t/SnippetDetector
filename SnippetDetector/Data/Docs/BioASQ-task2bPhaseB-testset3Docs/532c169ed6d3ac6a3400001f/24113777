Many of the actions of thyroid hormones (THs) occur via TH binding to intracellular receptors. Although it was long thought that THs diffused passively across plasma membranes, it is now recognized that cellular entry is mediated by a variety of membrane transporter proteins. In this study, we identified cDNAs encoding the TH transporters monocarboxylate transferases 8 (mct8) and 10 (mct10) as well as eight distinct organic anion-transporting polypeptide (oatp) proteins from fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Analysis of the tissue distribution of transporter mRNAs revealed that mct8 and mct10 transcripts were both abundant in liver, but also present at lower levels in brain, gonad and other tissues. Transcripts encoding oatp1c1 were highly abundant in brain, liver and gonad, and exhibited significant sex differences in the liver and gonad. Treatment of adult male minnows with 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) or the goitrogen methimazole altered gene transcript abundance for several transporters. Fish given exogenous T3 had reduced mct8 and oapt1c1 mRNA levels in the liver compared to methimazole-treated fish. In the brain, transcripts for mct8, mct10, oatp2b1, and oatp3a1 were each reduced in abundance in fish with elevated T3. As a whole, these results provide evidence that TH status influences the transcriptional dynamics of mct8, mct10 and several Oatp genes including oatp1c1 in teleost fish.
