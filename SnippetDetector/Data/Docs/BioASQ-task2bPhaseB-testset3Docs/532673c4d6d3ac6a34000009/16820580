BACKGROUND: Both glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) may improve cardiovascular performance after coronary artery surgery (CABG) but their effects have not been directly compared and the effects of combined treatment are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 2 consecutive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials, in patients undergoing first time isolated on-pump CABG between January 2000 and September 2004, 440 patients were recruited and randomized to either placebo (5% dextrose) (n=160), GIK (40% dextrose, K+ 100 mmol.L(-1), insulin 70 u.L(-1)) (0.75 mL.kg(-1) h(-1)) (n=157), T3 (0.8 microg.kg(-1) followed by 0.113 microg.kg(-1) h(-1)) (n=63) or GIK+T3 (n=60). GIK/placebo therapy was administered from start of operation until 6 hours after removal of aortic cross-clamp (AXC) and T3/placebo was administered for a 6-hour period from removal of AXC. Serial hemodynamic measurements were taken up to 12 hours after removal of AXC and troponin I (cTnI) levels were assayed to 72 hours. Cardiac index (CI) was significantly increased in both the GIK and GIK/T3 group in the first 6 hours compared with placebo (P<0.001 for both) and T3 therapy (P=0.009 and 0.029, respectively). T3 therapy increased CI versus placebo between 6 and 12 hours after AXC removal (P=0.01) but combination therapy did not. Release of cTnI was lower in all treatment groups at 6 and 12 hours after removal of AXC. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with GIK, T3, and GIK/T3 improves hemodynamic performance and results in reduced cTnI release in patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery. Combination therapy does not provide added hemodynamic effect.
