The objective of this study was to investigate left cardiac damage and the cardioprotective effects of resveratrol in old rats with COPD. Rats 22 months old were divided into three groups: control (CTL), smoking and lipopolysaccharides (SM/LPS), and SM/LPS plus resveratrol (SM/LPS-Res). Cardiac function, pathology, oxidative stress, and apoptosis index were measured. Expression of myocardial SIRT1 was studied by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot detection. The heart weight-body weight ratio (LVW/BW) increased in the SM/LPS group compared with the CTL group. Both the LVW/BW and the area of fibrosis in the SM/LPS-Res group decreased compared with those in the SM/LPS group. 8-OHdG expression increased in cardiac tissue of rats in the SM/LPS group, which could be inhibited by resveratrol. Resveratrol significantly increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced the cardiac malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level in the SM/LPS-Res group. There was a significant decrease in the extent of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the SM/LPS-Res group compared with the SM/LPS group. SIRT1 mRNA increased in the SM/LPS-Res group compared with the SM/LPS group. In conclusion, resveratrol attenuated cardiac oxidative damage and left ventricular remodeling and enhanced the decreased expression of SIRT1 in hearts of old rats with emphysema and thus might be a therapeutic modality for cardiac injury complicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
