This study was designed to examine the effects of the antioxidant resveratrol on cardiac structure and function in pressure overload (PO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham operation and the aortic banding procedure. A subgroup of sham control and aortic-banded rats were treated with resveratrol for 2 wk after surgery. Echocardiographic analysis of cardiac structure and function along with Western blot analysis of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and redox factor-1 (ref-1) were performed in all groups after 4 wk of surgery. Banded rats showed significantly increased left ventricle-to-body weight ratio. Echocardiographic analysis showed that the interventricular septal wall thickness and left ventricular posterior wall thickness at systole and diastole were significantly increased in banded rats. Also, a significant increase in isovolumic relaxation time was observed in banded rats. Measured eNOS, iNOS, and ref-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in banded rats. Resveratrol treatment prevented the above changes in cardiac structure, function, and protein expression in banded rats. Aortic banding after 4 wk resulted in concentric remodeling and impaired contractile function due to PO on the heart. The 2-wk treatment with resveratrol was found to abolish PO-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Resveratrol may therefore be beneficial against PO-induced cardiac hypertrophy found in clinical settings of hypertension and aortic valve stenosis.
