Whereas studies involving animal models of cardiovascular disease demonstrated that resveratrol is able to inhibit hypertrophic growth, the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Because studies in cells other than cardiomyocytes revealed that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt are affected by resveratrol, we hypothesized that resveratrol prevents cardiac myocyte hypertrophy via these two kinase systems. Herein, we demonstrate that resveratrol reduces phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis and cell growth in rat cardiac myocytes via alterations of intracellular pathways involved in controlling protein synthesis (p70S6 kinase and eukaryotic elongation factor-2). Additionally, we demonstrate that resveratrol negatively regulates the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway thus modifying a critical component of the transcriptional mechanism involved in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Our data also indicate that these effects of resveratrol are mediated via AMPK activation and Akt inhibition, and in the case of AMPK, is dependent on the presence of the AMPK kinase, LKB1. Taken together, our data suggest that resveratrol exerts anti-hypertrophic effects by activating AMPK via LKB1 and inhibiting Akt, thus suppressing protein synthesis and gene transcription.
