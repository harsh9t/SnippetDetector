The aim of this study was to detect the inhibitory action of the early growth response gene-1 DNA enzyme (EDRz) as a carrying agent by liposomes on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and intimal hyperplasia. An autogenous vein graft model was established. EDRz was transfected to the graft vein. The vein graft samples were obtained on each time point after surgery. The expression of the EDRz transfected in the vein graft was detected using a fluorescent microscope. Early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) mRNA was measured using reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization. And the protein expression of Egr-1 was detected by using western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. EDRz was located at the media of the vein graft from 2 to 24 h, 7 h after grafting. The Egr-1 protein was mainly located in the medial VSMCs, monocytes, and endothelium cells during the early phase of the vein graft. The degree of VSMC proliferation and thickness of intima were obviously relieved compared with the no-gene therapy group. EDRz can reduce Egr-1 expression in autogenous vein grafts, effectively restrain VSMC proliferation and intimal hyperplasia, and prevent vascular stenosis and occlusion after vein graft.

1. ntroduction
n 1977, aterson et al. [1] first inhibited gene transcription using a complementary combination of single-stranded  and  in a cell-free system. ater, tephenson and amecnik [2] reversely inhibited the replication of the ous sarcoma virus using a 13 oligodeoxynucleotide and pioneered the direction of gene-based drugs by inhibiting gene expression.  variety of catalytic , called  enzymes, was one of the important breakthroughs in life science history since the discovery of catalytic  (ribozyme, z) [3β€“7].
n 1994, reaker and oyce [8] found that a single-stranded  molecule (catalytic ) can catalyze the hydrolysis of  phosphodiester bonds. his single-stranded  molecule was also called  enzyme (z). he enzyme activity center was the β€�10β€“23 motifβ€� [9β€“15] composed of 15 deoxyribonucleotides (5β€²-     -3β€²). ts mutation or reverse mutation variants had no activities. oth ends of the active center were substrate-binding regions that can specifically combine with the target  through the atson-rick base pairing.
arly growth response gene-1 (gr-1) is a ys2-is2-type zinc-finger transcription factor.  broad range of extracellular stimuli are capable of activating gr-1, thus mediating growth, proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis, therefore, participating in the progression of a variety of diseases such as atherosclerosis [16β€“19]. revious studies have demonstrated that gr-1 can activate the restenosis process and intimal hyperplasia and inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis in vein grafts [20]. he  enzyme is an oligonucleotide that bound to and interfered with translation of the gr-1 m. RNA and it could inhibit the expression of Egr-1. In the present study, an Egr-1 DNA enzyme (EDRz) was designed for Egr-1 mRNA, used a liposome as a carrying agent, and investigated the inhibitory action of the Egr-1 DNA enzyme on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and intimal hyperplasia.

2. aterials and ethods
2.1. onstruction of arly rowth esponse ene-1  nzyme. The primer sequences were as follows: 5β€²-CC GCT GCC AGG CTA GCT ACA ACG ACC CGG ACG T-3β€². The 3β€² end was phosphorothioate-modified, the 5β€² end was labeled with carboxyl fluorescein (FAM), and a total of 15 OD260 (495β€‰ΞΌg) of the Egr-1 DNA enzyme was synthesized (Figure 1). Approximately 80β€‰ΞΌL of DEPC was added to the solution (1β€‰:β€‰1000), mixed, centrifuged, and then added with 120β€‰ΞΌL of the liposome Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,USA). After 10β€‰min, 32β€‰ΞΌL of 1β€‰mmol/L MgCl2 and 568β€‰ΞΌL of Pluronic gel 30% F-127 (Sigma, USA) were added to a final volume of 800β€‰ΞΌL. The solution was oscillated and homogenized at 4Β°C and stored until use.2.2. Establishment of Animal Model and Sample CollectionThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal use protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the First Hospital Affiliated to Jiamusi University. Ninety Wistar rats of either sex (200β€‰g to 250β€‰g) were used. The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate solution (300β€‰mg/kg) and underwent a sterile microsurgery under the SXP-1B microscope (10 times). The procedure was as follows: about 5β€‰mm of the rat's right jugular vein was cut; the vein was flushed with heparin saline; and the vein was anastomosed to the infrarenal abdominal aorta using an 11-0 vascular suture line in an end-to-end manner. Up to 8β€‰ΞΌL of EDRz was evenly used around the graft vein (including anastomotic) when no signs of active bleeding were found. The retroperitoneum was closed without the use of anticoagulants either before or after the surgery. The animals were randomly divided into 9 groups (10/group), namely, 1, 2, 6, and 24β€‰h and 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 days after the graft surgery, respectively. The graft vein specimens were cut on each time point. The no-gene therapy group was taken as control group (Figure 2). The specimens were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) for 2β€‰h. The gradient sucrose was dehydrated. Then, they were frozen-embedded and cut into 5β€‰ΞΌm thick sections. EDRz transfection on the vein graft was observed under a fluorescence microscope. The localization of EDRz was determined by confocal microscopy. The fluorescence gray value was detected using a fluorescence image analyzer and was replicated and verified in multiple samples.2.3. Histomorphology StainingVein grafts were fixed in 10% neutral formalin for 24β€‰h. Conventional dehydration was then performed. The grafts were transparent and wax-dipped. The wax block was embedded and the middle section of the vein graft was cut into 5β€‰ΞΌm thick sections. HE staining was conducted and images of the computer image analysis system were collected. Finally, intimal hyperplasia thickness was measured. The data collection and analysis of intimal hyperplasia were performed in a blinded manner.2.4. In Situ HybridizationSpecimens were processed with fixation. The sucrose gradient was dehydrated, and frozen-embedded, and then a constant cold slicer was used to slice them into 5β€‰ΞΌm thick sections. Digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotides were used as probes, and the in situ hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Wuhan Boster Corporation, Wuhan, China). The specimens were dyed with DAB or AEC. The percentage of positive cells in the total cell in eight-unit perspective was randomly counted and performed in a blinded manner.2.5. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain ReactionTotal RNA was extracted from cell lines according to instructions of the kit (Wuhan Boster Corporation, Wuhan, China). Primers for Egr-1 were designed using the Jellyfish software according to the sequence in GenBank and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon. For Egr-1, the primers were 5β€²-CAG TCG TAG TGA CCA CCT TAC CA-3β€² (Fwd) and 5β€²-AGG TTG CTG TCA TGT CTG AAA GAC-3β€² (Rev), 448-bp long. For Ξ²-actin, the primers were 5β€²-TTG TAA CCA ACT GGG ACG ATA-3β€² (Fwd) and 5β€²-GAT CTT GAT CTT CAT GGT GCT-3β€² (Rev), 668-bp long. The PCR program involved the following procedures: predenaturation for 2β€‰min at 94Β°C; denaturation for 30β€‰s at 94Β°C; annealing for 30β€‰s at 58Β°C; extension for 1β€‰min at 72Β°C; and final elongation at 72Β°C for 10β€‰min. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed. PCR products were analyzed by electrofluorescence on 2% agarose gel in a 1x TAE buffer at a voltage of 100β€‰V for 1β€‰h and EB-stained for 20β€‰min. Band intensity was photographed and analyzed on the Gel Imaging System. The gene expression value = Egr-1mRNA/Ξ²-actin mRNA.2.6. Immunohistochemical StainingConventional SABC staining was performed according to the kit's instructions (Wuhan Boster Company, Wuhan, China). PBS was used in place of primary antibodies as the negative control. The nucleus or cytoplasm had positive brown-yellow (DAB) or red (AEC) particles at 400 times magnification under the light microscope; it was considered positive regardless of dyeing intensity as long as there was a color display. The percentage of positive cells in the total cell in the eight-unit perspective was randomly counted and was performed in a blinded manner.2.7. Western Blot AnalysisThe specimens were lysed with a cell lysis solution. The vessel tissues were cut into pieces. The specimens were ultrasound-homogenized. Proteins (100β€‰ΞΌg/sample) were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry system. Then, the membrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk diluted in TBST for 1β€‰h at room temperature. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated with a primary antibody for 2β€‰h at room temperature. Next, the membranes were further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody at a 1β€‰:β€‰500 dilution. The specimens were washed with TBST three times. Then, 12.5β€‰mg of Ξ²-Naphthyl acid phosphate and 12.5β€‰mg of O-Dianisidine tetrazotized (Sigma Corporation) were added to color the specimens. The NC membrane was photographed and analyzed on the Gel Imaging System.2.8. Statistical MethodsData were shown as mean Β± SD (x-Β±s) and analyzed using the SPSS10 statistical software. The significance of the differences between the group means was determined using ANOVA and post hoc test.

3. esults
3.1. gr-1  nzyme (z) ransfection. The early growth response gene-1 DNA enzyme was mainly located in the tunica media, adventitia, and partial endothelial cells of the vein graft 1β€‰h after the grafting in transfection group (fluorescence expression value of 70.3 Β± 13.5) (Table 1, Figure 3(a)). The early growth response gene-1 DNA enzyme was located in the tunica media of the vein graft from 2β€‰h to 24β€‰h after-grafting. There was a small amount of EDRz in the tunica media of the vein graft 3β€‰d after the grafting. It was mainly located in the intima of the vein graft 7β€‰d after grafting (Table 1, Figure 3(b)). There were no traces of the early growth response gene-1 DNA enzyme in the vein grafts at 14, 28, and 42β€‰d and control group (Table 1, Figure 3(c)).3.2. Changes in HistomorphologyThere was no expression of PCNA protein in normal vein. There was still a small amount of slightly disordered VSMCs in the media 2β€‰h to 6β€‰h after the vein graft compared with the control group. Slightly positive expression of PCNA at 6β€‰h, positive cell rate of (2.5β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.4)% in transfection group, (5.6β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.4)% in control group. Moreover, VSMCs were also found partly in the thin layer of a thrombus formation in the cavity surface of the intima. The intima was partly damaged at 24β€‰h to 3 d after grafting. The expression of PCNA protein was increased from 24β€‰h to 3β€‰d. In addition, endothelial cells were shed and there was a small amount of thrombosis in the local area. The intima thickened and VSMC proliferation was visible at 7β€‰d. Intimal hyperplasia reached a peak (16.4β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰4.7β€‰ΞΌm) at 14 d. The expression of PCNA protein reached peak at 14β€‰d, (15.3β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰4.2)% in transfection group, (33.5β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰6.2)% in control group. The vascellum basically completed endothelialization and disordered VSMC were still visible compared with the control group whose degree of VSMC proliferation and thickness of intima were obviously relieved at the same time. The difference was statistically significant (F = 3.42, P < 0.01). Intimal hyperplasia thickness decreased at 28 and 42β€‰d compared with 14β€‰d and the expression of PCNA protein was decrease (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 4).3.3. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)Egr-1 mRNA expression reached a peak (gene expression value of 1.89β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.63) 1β€‰h after the EDRz was transfected. The expression decreased (0.85β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.42, 0.13β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.03, 0.09β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.04) from 2β€‰h to 24β€‰h after grafting. The expression was weak (0.05β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.01) 3β€‰d after-grafting. There were no more Egr-1 mRNA expressions at 7, 14, 28, and 42β€‰d after grafting (Figure 5(a)). Egr-1 mRNA expression had biphasic changes in control group. Egr-1 mRNA rapid rise at 1β€‰h after graft, a spontaneous decline at 6β€‰h to 3β€‰d, increase at 7β€‰d after graft operation, a peak at 28 days (Figure 5(b)).3.4. In Situ HybridizationPartial VSMC showed an Egr-1 mRNA-positive expression in the media of the vein graft 1β€‰h after EDRz transfection. The strongest positive cell expression was (20.1β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰6.4)%. The difference was statistically significant (F = 3.25, P < 0.01) compared with the rest of the time points. Its expression decreased from 2β€‰h to 3 d after grafting. There was no Egr-1 mRNA positive expression of neointimal VSMC 7β€‰d after grafting. The trend of positive cells was consistent with the RT-PCR results (Table 3, Figure 6(a)) in control group, and the positive expression of Egr-1 mRNA was found in the part of VSMCs of the media at 1β€‰h after graft. A peak at 28β€‰d, the positive rate of Egr-1 mRNA was (45.7β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰6.4)%, Egr-1 mRNA major located in the vascular smooth muscle cells of neointimal (Table 3, Figure 6(b)).3.5. Western Blot AnalysisEgr-1-positive cells were not detected in the normal vein. Egr-1 protein expression appeared 2β€‰h after EDRz transfection. The optical density value was (26.4β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰9.2) Γ— 103. Its expression decreased from 6β€‰h to 3β€‰d after grafting, with optical density values of (14.5β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰5.2) Γ— 103, (3.4β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰1.5) Γ— 103, and (2.0β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.8) Γ— 103. Egr-1 positive cells were no longer present 7β€‰d after grafting (Figure 7(a)). In control group, we found that Egr-1 protein was expressed at the early phase of 2β€‰h, and continuing to 6β€‰h, the expression of Egr-1 protein was decline from 24β€‰h to 3β€‰d, reincreased at 7β€‰d, and reached peak at 28β€‰d (Figure 7(b)).3.6. ImmunohistochemistryThe Egr-1 protein was mainly located in the medial VSMCs, monocytes, and endothelium cells during the early phase of the vein graft. However, there were no Egr-1 proteins in the medial and neointimal VSMCs after 7β€‰d. The positive expression rates were as follows: positive cell rate of (15.3β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰4.2)% at 2h; positive cell rate of (9.7β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰2.4)% at 6β€‰h; positive cell rate of (6.4β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰1.8)% at 24β€‰h; and positive cell rate of (2.3β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰0.2)% at 3d (Figure 8(a)). In control group, the positive expression of Egr-1 protein reached peak at 28 days (40.7β€‰β€‰Β±β€‰β€‰9.5)% (Figure 8(b)).

4. iscussion
 (816 to 818 sequence) is a selected target of the gr-1 m. RNA. The splice site was located between 816 and 817, adding T GCA GGC CC to the 3β€² end of DNA enzyme for the 807β€“815 sequence (A CGU CCG GG) of Egr-1 mRNA and ACC GTC GCC [21β€“24] to the 5β€² end of DNA enzyme for the 817β€“825 sequence (UGG CAG CGG). A phosphorothioate modification was made in the 3β€² end to resist nuclease degradation, and the 5β€² end was labeled with carboxy fluorescein (FAM) for detection purposes. The constructed DNA enzyme was called Egr-1 DNA enzyme (EDRz) (Figure 1). The 816 base (A) of the Egr-1 mRNA did not undergo base pairing with EDRz. Meanwhile, the rest of the EDRz sites formed the combination of base pairing with Egr-1 mRNA. Then, the latter underwent conformational changes. The 2β€² end at the point of the OH proton was cut with the help of divalent metal cations, such as Mg2. Moreover, a nucleophilic attack occurred on the adjacent phosphate. The Egr-1mRNA molecular structure was dissociated by two transesterification reactions [25β€“30].
The substrate-binding site can be applied to shear the RNA of a variety of pathogens and mRNAs of disease-related genes after changing its sequence composition in the 10β€“23 DNA enzyme [31, 32]. In gene therapy, 10β€“23 DNA enzymes have the advantages of both the ribozyme (Rz) and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASODN) [33, 34]. The 10β€“23 DNA enzyme has the following features compared with ASODN: it not only has a substrate RNA antisense inhibitory effect by virtue of the two substrate-binding sites, but also kills virus RNA through the β€�shearβ€� mechanism [35β€“38]. Furthermore, DNA enzyme molecules can be used repeatedly, which means that they can shear a number of RNA molecules. The 10β€“23 DNA enzyme has the following characteristics compared with a variety of Rz: the identified splice site of 10β€“23 DNA enzyme is present in a range of RNA molecules, including the RNA translation initiation codon AUG of viruses. It is a good shear target and has more shearing targets to choose from compared with Rz. Its nature is relatively stable. The stability of DNA is about 100,β€‰000 times that of RNA in the conditions of physiological pH, temperature, ionic strength, and so on. Its resistance to hydrolysis is about 100 times or more than that of a protein enzyme [39β€“41]. The sequence of the active center is short. The molecular weight is relatively small with relatively good elasticity. Therefore, it is less affected by the secondary structure of the target sequence. The trend to the substrate is better. Thus, the specificity of the target RNA, combing stability and shear activity, is expressed better than Rz in general [42β€“44]. It is easier to dissociate the DNA-RNA hybrid molecule than the RNA-RNA hybrid molecule. Therefore, the shear rate of the shear product DRz dissociation process is relatively small [45, 46]. The RNA of the DNA-RNA hybrid molecules can be degraded by the RNA enzyme H. Hence, the DNA enzyme can not only directly kill the target RNA such as Rz, but also cause the hydrolysis of the RNA enzyme H to target RNAs, such as ASODN [47, 48].
The results of this experiment combined with those of previous studies [8, 49, 50] indicated that the early growth response gene-1 DNA enzyme was mainly located in the media and adventitia of the vein graft 1β€‰h after grafting and then gradually shifted to the media. There was a small amount of EDRz in the media of the vein graft 3β€‰d after grafting and was mainly located in the media. It was mainly located in the intima of the vein graft 7β€‰d after grafting. In addition, the Egr-1 DNA enzyme can also be found in some small newborn blood vessels. However, Egr-1 mRNA and protein expressions in the vein graft were not detected 14β€‰d after grafting. There was no EDRz in the vein grafts, suggesting that the EDRz pathway is adventitia β†’ medial β†’ intima and perhaps degraded by a deoxyribonuclease in the end. Egr-1 mRNA and protein expressions decreased at the same time point. Egr-1 mRNA expression decreased obviously 1β€‰h after grafting. This finding indicated that the Egr-1 DNA enzyme rapidly transferred from the adventitia to the media to combine with the Egr-1 mRNA under a short period of time. Hence, the role of the carrier liposome Lipofectamine 2000 was confirmed. Egr-1 proteins were mainly located in the medial VSMCs, monocytes, and endothelium cells during the early phase of the vein graft. However, there were no Egr-1 proteins in medial and neointimal VSMCs 7β€‰d after grafting, indicating that the early growth response gene-1 DNA enzyme can reduce Egr-1 expression in an autogenous vein graft. VSMC proliferation and intimal hyperplasia reached a peak 7 and 14β€‰d after grafting. The degree of VSMC proliferation and thickness of intima were obviously relieved at the same time compared with the no-gene therapy group. Therefore, Egr-1 DNA enzyme transfection of vein grafts with the liposome Lipofectamine 2000 as a carrier can effectively restrain VSMC proliferation and intimal hyperplasia and prevent vascular stenosis and occlusion after vein grafting.
