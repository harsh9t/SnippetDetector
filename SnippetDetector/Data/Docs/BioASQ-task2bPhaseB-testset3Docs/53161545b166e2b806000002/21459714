The HNPCC syndrome (hereditary non polyposis colon cancer) or Lynch syndrome stands for an autosomic dominant condition leading to the most prevalent hereditary colo-rectal cancers (CCR). MMR (mismatch repair)'s genes are involved in carcinogenesis as they play a role in ADNA mismatch repair. Microsatellite instability (MSI+ phenotype) induced by germline mutations is characteristic of such tumors and is necessary to assert the diagnosis. The HNPCC syndrome is associated with a significant increased risk of CCR altogether with endometrium, upper urinary tract and small bowel carcinomas as well as ovarian, biliary system and gastric cancers although of lesser extent. It is of importance to diagnose HNPCC syndrome prior to the treatment starts because it may influence patient's (as well as her/his relatives) disease management (type of surgery, surveillance and screening exams). New French recommendations, developed in 2009, about prophylactic colo-rectal and gynecologic surgeries and monitoring update latest ones published on 2004.
