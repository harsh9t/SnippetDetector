BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major risk factor for the long-term complications of diabetes. Mobile, self-measurement of blood pressure is emerging as a method to manage blood pressure in general, but its impact in patients with diabetes is unclear. METHODS: We randomized 137 patients with diabetes and hypertension to either mobile telemonitoring (n = 72) or usual care (n = 65). Clinic blood pressure was recorded at baseline and after 6 months. Patients in the intervention arm transmitted weekly blood pressure readings wirelessly, using adapted sensors via mobile phones to a central server. Clinicians received the data in real-time and using a web-based application provided management advice to the patient and their physicians. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure fell significantly in the patients in the intervention group (mean [95% confidence interval], -6.5 [-0.8 to -12.2] mm Hg; P = 0.027) and remained unchanged in the control group (2.1 [9.3 to -5.0] mm Hg; P = 0.57). Patients within the intervention arm of African origin seemed to benefit more from the intervention. In addition, those who achieved a systolic blood pressure of <120 mm Hg had lower average blood sugars than those with higher readings (7.8 [SD 1.6] vs. 8.9 [SD 2.2] mmol/L; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes, mobile telemonitoring has potential for delivering intensified care to improve blood pressure control, and its use may be associated with reduced exposure to hyperglycemia.
