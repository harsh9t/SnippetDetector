Despite the considerable advances in the treatment of hypertension that have been made over the past few decades, adequate management and control of this condition remains poor, and efforts are ongoing to develop new strategies to improve related outcomes. Novel therapeutic approaches to the management of systemic hypertension fall into two major categories: (i) those that seek to improve blood pressure-lowering efficacy using new therapeutic strategies in addition to standard non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches and (ii) novel ways to optimize and improve the efficacy and utility of existing therapies. Novel procedure- and device-based strategies to control hypertension include renal sympathetic denervation and baroreflex sensitization. These two techniques will be the focus of the present review.
