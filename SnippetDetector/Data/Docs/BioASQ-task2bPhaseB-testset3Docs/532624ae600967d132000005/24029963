Renal sympathetic denervation for resistant hypertension treatment : current perspectives.
</title>

<text>

<abstract>
The authors review the concept of resistant hypertension and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension as a rational basis for the technique of renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) performed percutaneously. This revision is the result of an active search for scientific articles with the term "renal denervation" in the Medline and PubMed databases. The techniques and devices used in the procedure are presented, as well as clinical outcomes at six, 12 and 24 months after the intervention with the Symplicity catheter. Significant decreases and progressively higher reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed after RSD. The complication rate was minimal. New devices for RSD and its ongoing clinical studies are cited. In conclusion, the RSD presents itself as an effective and safe approach to resistant hypertension. Results from ongoing studies and longer follow-up of these patients are expected to confirm the initial results and put into perspective the expansion of the procedure use in hypertension approach.

Introduction
lood pressure () is directly related to the risk of death and impairment of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, among others. ccording to  razilian
uidelines on rterial ypertension1, in razil this disease has high prevalence, over 30%, and low
control rates, below 20%1.
espite the recommendation to carry out a strict and effective control of tensional
levels, frequently these goals are not satisfactorily achieved, resulting in greater
risk of developing complications and increasing mortality. any reasons might be
involved in obtaining these non-satisfactory results, in a way that only a minority
of hypertensive individuals present a proper control of their . or these reasons,
arterial hypertension () that is difficult to control is a relevant public health
issue1. ncluded in this
group are individuals with resistant arterial hypertension (). ifferent studies
show the  prevalence ranges between 3-30%1,2.
n this scenario, percutaneous approach for bilateral renal sympathetic denervation
() using radiofrequency ablation procedure3 has shown promise among new available therapeutic strategies
and is based on the knowledge that, among the many physiopathological mechanisms
involved in refractoriness to  control, the excessive stimulation of renal
sympathetic nervous system is distinctive3.
timulated by new treatment for , this study aims at reviewing  concept,
involvement of sympathetic nervous system () in  increase, and clinical results
with .
esistant arterial hypertension: definition and associated conditions. Resistant arterial hypertension (RAH) diagnosis is confirmed when there is
maintenance of increased BP levels (above adequate BP goals): β‰¥ 140/90 mmHg for
hypertensive individuals in general and > 130/80 mmHg for high risk patients,
such as diabetics), despite the use of three or more antihypertensive drugs of
different classes, including a diuretic at optimal doses2.Importantly, the diagnosis of true RAH requires the exclusion of secondary causes
of AH, in addition to any other associated condition that may interfere in the
proper BP control, characterizing pseudo-resistance1,2.Among the main conditions associated to RAH and subject to specific approach are
the inappropriate choice of antihypertensive drugs and/or use of insufficient
dosage, failure to measure BP, adherence failure to prescribed medication and/or
changes in lifestyle, white-coat effect, AH resulted from a non-identified
and/or non-treated secondary cause, and associated conditions that may
complicate the BP control, such as obesity, sleep apnea and the use of
concomitant medications that increase the BP1,2.White-coat effect is a particularly important condition and it must be removed
through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) before confirming the RAH
diagnosis1,2.More recently, it has been highlighted the association between sleep disorders,
including sleep obstructing apnea (SOA), non-controlled AH and cardiovascular
complications in adults1. The
prevalence of SOA in adult patients with RAH has been estimated at 84%4.The role of sympathetic nervous system in context of AHStimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) increases BP in normotensive
and hypertensive due to the involvement of baroreceptors and chemoreceptors,
through peripheral and central mechanisms that have an effect on the heart,
kidneys and peripheral vasculature, leading to a cardiac output, water
retention, and increased peripheral vascular resistance, which has a major role
in AH physiopathology5,6.SNS is involved in BP acute variations, in situations like exercising and
postural variation. However, the mechanisms responsible for the presence of
sympathetic hyperactivity in chronic AH and its role in AH maintenance remain
unknown5-7. It is known that the increased
sympathetic activity and the consequent release of catecholamine by sympathetic
nerves, in addition to increasing vascular tone in resistance vessels, in early
stages of AH, could also be stimulating trophic mechanisms and vascular
hypertrophy in the long-term. It is possible that trophic alterations on vessel
walls are maintaining BP increase in the chronic stage of AH5-7.Noradrenaline serum levels are higher in hypertensive individuals when compared
to normotensive ones, primarily in young people, in which sympathetic
hyperactivity seems to have a central role in the development of AH5,6.Reflex mechanisms of the control of an autonomic activity are suppressed in the
context of AH. It is probable that the minor baroreflex sensitivity observed in
hypertensive patients is the primary determinant of the BP variability observed
and, indirectly, of the injuries on associated target organs5,6.SNS activity is related to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
the early morning hours. In this period, there is an increase in
alpha-sympathetic activity, with high BP, of the heart rate and cardiac output
present in many hypertensive patients in this period of the day5-7.Exposure to stress in known to increase the sympathetic activity. This situation
could be induced in laboratory animals, developing AH by exposure to stress. In
young individuals with genetic predisposition to develop AH, it was observed
higher vasoconstrictor response to mental stress or physical exercise tests and
higher chance to develop AH5-7.Plenty of evidence has pointed to the role of sympathetic hyperactivity in the
development and progression of cardiovascular and metabolic complications
related to increased BP, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular
hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, heart arrhythmia, and insulin
resistance5-7.Renal sympathetic nervous systemThe abundant adrenergic innervation in kidneys and renal SNS appear to modulate
the renin release via beta-adrenergic receptors and control renal hemodynamics
via alpha-adrenergic receptors. Thus, the increased renal SNS activity could
contribute to AH physiopathology through many mechanisms: increased tubular
reabsorption of water and sodium, increased secretion of renin and production of
angiotensin II, increased renal vascular resistance, and reduced glomerular
filtration. In fact, the increased renal SNS activity has been demonstrated in
several models of experimental AH5-7.Sympathetic efferent innervation of the kidney is carried out through a dense
network of postganglionic neurons that innervate the kidneys; axons of these
neurons exit chest and lumbar sympathetic trunk and reach the pre-paravertebral
sympathetic ganglia. They run throughout the artery and renal hilum, subdividing
itself and penetrating the cortex and juxtaglomerular area. Stimulating the
renal sympathetic nerve increases the production and release of noradrenaline,
while interrupting the sympathetic nervous stimulation results in reducing its
production and release. When renal sympathetic nerves are stimulated, beta-1
receptors increase renin secretion and alpha-1 receptors increase renal
reabsorption of sodium and fluids, promote renal vasoconstriction and reduce
renal blood flow3,5-7.Triggering afferent renal sympathetic nerves results in signals that reach the
cardiovascular and renal regulation centers in the central nervous system. Thus,
afferent sympathetic fibers appear to strongly contribute in the regulation of
the systemic vascular resistance and BP control3,5-7 and, therefore,
antihypertensive treatment must consider the effective inhibition of sympathetic
activity5.Thus, mechanisms through which RSD reduces BP are fascinating, although not yet
completely understood. Probably there is a reduction of efferent sympathetic
nervous fibers and an additional reduction of afferent sensory fibers. Evidence
suggests the possibility that sensory afferent sympathetic nervous fibers also
participate in AH genesis and its denervation has therapeutic effects3,5-7.

Renal sympathetic denervation
nterventional methods more recently implemented, such as baroreflex stimulation or
renal sympathetic denervation3,
have been pointed out as new strategies to treat 3,8.
echnique and devices. Invasive procedures for the treatment of AH had already been tried before. Lumbar
sympathectomy performed six decades ago9 in 1,266 hypertensive patients with malign AH resulted
in relevant and effective decrease of BP, but the increased incidence of
complications, such as postural hypotension, syncope and impotence, limited the
use of this technique in clinical practice. The development of effective
antihypertensive medications also contributed to stop using this technique.Recently, efforts have been directed to conduct a bilateral approach of renal
nerves, initially through a percutaneous interventional technique using a
catheter embedded to a radiofrequency device. Radiofrequency pulses are fired on
the arterial wall in several points, from the distal part to the proximal part
of both arteries, in spiral. The procedure can be conducted in renal arteries
with β‰¥ 4 mm diameter and at least 20 mm length, before any bifurcation of the
main branches3,10,11.Pre-clinical studies demonstrated that this technique is safe, efficient and
minimally invasive, associated with little incidence of side effects and short
recovery time3,10. In pigs, the radiofrequency application
causes acute transmural lesion with coagulation, loss of endothelial surface and
thrombus formation, but without impairment of the renal perfusion. In 10 days,
it was observed a reendothelization of arterial luminal surface12. Histopathological evaluation
of pigs, six months after the procedure, primarily revealed renal nerves
fibrosis. Findings for renal artery have shown 10-25% fibrosis of medial and
adventitial layer with mild ruptures of the external elastic lamina, without
changes on smooth muscular layer, without thrombosis or arterial stenosis. No
changes on kidneys or bladder were found13.To date, clinical results are very positive and encouraging. Systematic review,
including 19 studies and 683 individuals, concluded that RSD promoted decreases
of systolic BP (SBP) which varied between 18-36 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP)
ranging between 9-15 mmHg. In five studies, it was observed a BP-lowering effect
sustained in 12 months of follow-up. There was no worsening of renal function
and there were very few side effects related to the procedure, such as
pseudo-aneurysm of renal artery, hypotension and bradicardia14.Several devices have been developed to conduct RSD8. What presents clinical results with larger
number of patients and longer follow-up period is the Symplicity (Medtronic
Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota) catheter system, which fires radiofrequency
pulses. Radiofrequency RSD is also possible with other devices, in ongoing
development, some have already been tried in human beings and approved for use
in Europe, such as the catheters EnligHTN (St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul,
Minnesota), Vessix V2 (Vessix Vascular Inc., Laguna Hills, California), and One
Shot (Maya Medical Inc.,Campbell, California) catheter. The radiofrequency
catheters Thermocool (Biosense Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, California) and Chilli
II (Boston Scientific Inc., San Jose, California) are being used for human
beings, but have not been approved for use yet. New technology involving
ultrasound ablation is also available with Paradise (ReCor Medical Inc.,
Ronkonkoma, New York) catheter, already in experimental clinical use8.Simplicity studies: results and limitationsRSD technique was initially tested in an open-label pilot clinical study,
Symplicity HTN-111, conducted
with 45 patients with RAH, with preserved renal function. Patients
administrated, in average, 4.7 antihypertensive drugs and had mean baseline BP
of 177/101 mmHg. Primary outcomes of the study were procedure safety and
decrease of casual BP. Secondary outcomes were procedure effects on the
production of renal noradrenaline (spillover) and renal function. Patients'
follow-up occurred with one, three, six, nine and twelve months, without
adjusting the quantity of antihypertensive medications, unless
necessary11.BP decreases were significant in all periods of the follow-up. Thus, with one
month of follow-up, the observed SBP and DBP decrease was of β�’14/β�’10 mmHg,
respectively, reaching β�’27/β�’17 mmHg with 12 months after procedure. Six of the
45 patients (13%) had SBP reduction < 10 mmHg, being considered as
non-responsive, while the five patients with RAH who were not subjected to the
procedure (control group) had BP increased in subsequent evaluations. Twelve
months after the procedure, 38% of patients had BP controlled (SBP < 140
mmHg) and 28% had BP partially controlled (SBP 140-159 mmHg)11-

of periprocedural diffuse abdominal pain, relieved with analgesics. The
procedure proved to be safe and free from complications in 43 of the 45 patients
(one patient had renal artery dissection that was treated and resolved by
interrupting the RSD procedure and another patient had pseudo-aneurysm at the
injection site and was treated conservatively). Angiographies conducted after
the procedure in 18 patients have not demonstrated any abnormality of renal
arteries; thus, magnetic resonance conducted after six months in 14 patients had
not demonstrated complications related to the procedure11.The efficiency of the RSD procedure was also evaluated by the decreased
noradrenaline release (spillover): in 10 study patients, this decrease was of
47%, and these patients had a decreased mean BP after six months of β�’22/β�’12
mmHg, similar to the group as a whole. Heart rate remained unaltered at all
moments11.Positive results of this initial pilot study stimulated the proposal for a new
study: the Symplicity HTN-215,
randomized, prospective, multicenter study. In this study, 106 patients with RAH
were randomized for RSD (n = 52, initial mean BP of 178/96 mmHg) or maintenance
of the previous drug therapy (n = 54, initial mean BP of 178/97 mmHg), having as
main outcome the modification of casual BP in six months and as secondary
outcomes the procedure safety, occurrence of cardiovascular outcomes, and
additional measures of BP after six months.At the end of the sixth month of follow-up, casual BP in the RSD group was
reduced in -32/-12 mmHg in relation to baseline. In the control group, BP had no
decrease (+1/0 mmHg). Thus, the difference of BP between RSD and control groups
after six months was of 33/11 mmHg. Significant decreases were also observed in
residential measurement and ABPM and BP at six months, although smaller in
absolute numbers to decreased casual BP observed15 (Table
1).Ten patients (20%) reduced the number of medications administered in the group
subjected to intervention against three (6%) in the control group. Four patients
(8%) increased the number of drugs used in the RSD group against six (12%) in
the control group15.At the end of six months, 41 patients (84%) who were subjected to RSD showed a
decreased SBP β‰¥ 10 mmHg and were considered responsive, against only 18 patients
(35%) in the control group. The procedure had not complications or side
effects15. The
patients who, during the first six months, continued administering medications
and had an unsatisfactory control of BP, were submitted to RSD, and the
follow-up was extended to one year, with BP results similar to those who
underwent the intervention at baseline16. One-year results of the follow-up of patients who
underwent RSD in Symplicity HTN-2 study showed decrease maintenance of SBP
(β�’28.1 mmHg), value similar to that observed with six months of follow-up (β�’31.7
mmHg)16 - Table 1.However, in Symplicity HTN-111
and Symplicity HTN-2 (HR11)15
studies, we observed important limitations that need to be considered: a)
possible mechanisms responsible for reducing BP at RSD were not investigated in
any of the studies6,11,15,17,18; b) there was no control group
for Symplicity HTN-111,
reducing the relevance of its results; c) at Symplicity HTN-215, due to the complexity of the
tested procedure (invasive intervention), the study could not be blind, thus
creating a possible evaluation bias6,11,15,17,18; d) in both
studies, patients were not properly evaluated for the possibility of secondary
AH (it is known that up to 10% of patients with RAH have primary aldosteronism
and, in these patients, RAH invasive treatment could be considered; e) only a
small number of patients was administering the appropriate clinical therapy for
RAH treatment, such as the restriction of salt in diet and use of
spironolactone, raising the question whether these patients were really
treatment-resistant. Thus, it is believed that more rigorous inclusion and
exclusion criteria must be applied in future studies in order to test this RAH
treatment technique6,11,15,17,18.Still with limitations, in both studies some patients had their medication
changed during the follow-up, reducing the impact of the procedure on BP
decrease6,11,15,17,18. Another aspect was the wide
variability of hypotensive response observed at the end of six months with
different methods of BP measurement used in both studies, making the efficacy
analysis of the procedure quite heterogeneous6,11,15,17,18. It is worth
noting that in both studies, only part of the patients was subjected to ABPM,
and this supplemental method is crucial to remove the white-coat effect. In this
cohort, BP decrease in ABPM was of approximately 1/3 from that obtained for
casual BP, suggesting the RSD effects may not be as significant as they
initially appeared6,11,15,17,18.A concern with this technique is related to safety and durability of hypotensive
effect in the long-term, due to the regenerative ability of the nervous
tissue6,11,15,17,18. However, the follow-up of 24
months after the procedure of 153 patients with RAH in the study Symplicity
HTN-119 showed
progressively greater decreases of casual BP after procedure, reaching β�’32/β�’14
mmHg at 24 months. The authors concluded that RSD resulted in substantial
decrease and sustained of BP with two-year follow-up, without significant
adverse events.It is worth noting that about 20% of patients initially selected for the
procedure did not participate in the study Symplicity HTN-215 for difficulties in renal
anatomy that prevented the procedure from being carried out, which could limit
the clinical use of this therapy on a large scale6,11,15,17,18.Ultimately, not all patients subjected to the procedure managed to reduce the BP.
If we consider that RSD had a mean decrease of SBP of 20-25 mmHg and DBP of
10-15 mmHg, at the end of 12 months of follow-up, similar decreases in SBP and
DBP were also observed in patients administering spironolactone as the fourth
drug in RAH treatment.For this reason, it is important to try to identify factors that may predict the
therapeutic success of the intervention. Univariate analysis in Symplicity
HTN-111 did not
identify any pre-procedure condition capable of predicting RSD success, while in
Symplicity HTN-215 the highest
SBP values and use of central sympatholytic agents were capable of predicting
the procedure success6,11,15,17,18.Due to the nature of the procedure, a more detailed analysis on renal function of
patients undergoing RSD is mandatory17. Extended results of Symplicity HTN-1 for 24 months of
follow-up19 observed a
significant decrease of TGF (-16 ml / min/1,73 m2) in 10 patients;
smaller decrease, but also significant (-7,8 ml / min/1,73 m2) was
observed in five patients who were not administering spironolactone or any other
diuretic in the first year after procedure. It is worth noting that, even with
TGF decrease, no patient showed increase in serum creatinine or evolution to
renal insufficiency or need for dialysis, and this TGF decrease was also lower
than that estimated if patients had maintained BP unchanged from the protocol
start19.Clinical studies with other devicesEnligHTN is a multi-electrode catheter with a basket and, when it opens inside
the renal artery, it allows energy release simultaneously in four points of the
arterial endoluminal surface. It was the catheter used in ARSENAL study, which
preliminary results were presented in 2012, reporting a BP decrease of β�’28/β�’10
mmHg, one month after the intervention, with 78% of patients showing a decreased
systolic BP > 10 mmHg. Adverse events occurred in very few cases (n = 6):
bruising on the arterial puncture site, vasovagal response on sheath withdrawal
and bradycardia after procedure. Study final results will be recognized in 2013,
after the six months follow-up of 47 patients treated with RSD using
EnligHTN8
catheter.Vessix V2 system of DSR has a catheter with a low-pressure balloon, with bipolar
radiofrequency electrodes on the balloon surface, and it is being tested in the
REDUCE-HTN study, with closure of results scheduled for August, 2014.
Preliminary results in 10 patients showed BP decreases of β�’30/β�’11 mmHg8.The first experience in human beings with One Shot system was reported. It is a
catheter with an irrigated balloon and electrodes mounted helically, in a way
that radiofrequency pulse can to be conducted only once, making the procedure
faster and more accurate, without the need of handling the catheter. BP
decreases observed one month after intervention were similar to those observed
in the Symplicity20 study.ThermoCool catheter is being used in SWAN HT study and intends to include 800
hypertensive patients. Pilot study results with 10 patients have shown decreases
in BP and in markers of sympathetic activity. This same catheter and Chilli II
system are being implemented in SAVE study, which also aims at including a
relevant number of individuals - 500 patients8.Paradise catheter is being tested in REALISE study. Preliminary results of 15
patients have shown BP decrease of β�’32/β�’16 mmHg with three months of follow-up
and were presented in congress in 20128.Clinical studies that conduced RSD with irrigated radiofrequency ablation
catheters, generally used for ablation in heart tissue, have also demonstrated
positive results.Ten patients subjected to RSD with this type of device were followed-up for six
months. Mean BP decreases observed were significant (β�’21/β�’11 mmHg) and all
patients reduced their BP in 10 mmHg or more by the end of this observation
period. There were no complications on renal artery, such as aneurysms or
stenoses, and there were no renal function impairments21.Another experiment with this type of catheter confirmed the effect on BP,
evidencing decreases in mean BP of 24h on ABPM of β�’24/β�’14 mmHg, three months
after the procedure, without changes on renal function or albuminuria and
without vascular complications22.RSD effects besides the decreased peripheral arterial pressureRSD positive impact on the central hemodynamics and arterial rigidity was
recently reported. Evaluation of 110 patients who underwent RSD showed a
decrease in central aortic BP from 167/92 mmHg at baseline to 141/85 mmHg in six
months. In this same period, the augmentation index presented a decrease of 5.3%
and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity decreased from 11.6 Β± 3.2 m/s to 9.6
Β± 3.1 m/s. Improvements in central hemodynamics and arterial rigidity may be
important prognostic implications, particularly in patients with cardiovascular
high-risk, such as patients with RAH23.RSD was also capable of reducing the sympathetic activity measured through muscle
sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) after three months from procedure, with
mechanisms not yet elucidated. RSD results were more evident for single
sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers, demonstrating substantial and rapid decrease
of its acitivity24.The association between increased renal sympathetic activity and components of
metabolic syndrome (MS) was already demonstrated. A group of 50 patients was
evaluated25, with 37
being subjected to RSD and 13 maintained under conservative treatment. Initial
mean BP in both groups was of 178/96 mmHg. After three months of procedure, we
observed significant decreases in BP (β�’32/β�’12 mmHg), fasting blood glucose (from
118 mg/dl to 108 mg/dL), of insulin levels (from 20.8 UI/ml to 9.3 UI/ml) and
levels of C-peptide (from 5.3 ng/ml to 3.0 ng/ml). Authors also tested the
impact on insulin sensitivity, calculated through homeostasis model
assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and observed the decreased level of
insulin resistance with RSD (from 6 to 2.4). Glucose, after two hours of
stimulation, also improved after the procedure, with a decrease of 27 mg/dl
compared to baseline. There were no changes on BP and metabolic parameters in
the control group25.RSD impact on renal hemodynamics and urinary excretion of albumin was assessed in
a study with 100 patients: 88 were subjected to RSD and 12 constituted the
control group. There was a decrease in resistivity index with three and six
months of procedure, but there was no change in urinary excretion of albumin or
C-cystatin values. However, the number of individuals with microalbuminuria or
macroalbuminuria was reduced with RSD. There were no changes in these parameters
in the control group26.Another study27evaluated the
role of RSD in 10 patients with RAH and sleep apnea. At the end of six months,
it was observed a decrease in BP (β�’34/β�’13 mmHg) and improvement in sleep apnea
(from 16.3 to 4.5 events/hour).Another interesting evidence related to RSD was recently published, demonstrating
the capacity of this technique to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and
improve ventricular systolic and diastolic functions in patients with RAH. The
study28 included 46
patients who underwent RSD and echocardiogram in three stages (baseline, one
month and six months after the procedure), with 18 patients comprising the
control group. There was decrease in BP (β�’22.5/β�’7.2 mmHg after one month and
β�’27.8/β�’8.8 mmHg after six months from procedure) and LVH parameters: reduction
of the width of interventricular septum, left ventricular mass index from 53.9 Β±
15.6 g/m2,7 (112.4 Β± 33.9 g/m2) to 47.0 Β± 14.2
g/m2,7 (103.6 Β± 30.5g/m2) and 44.7 Β±
14.9g/m2,7 (94.9 Β± 29.8 g/m2) in one and six months,
respectively. The improvement of systolic and diastolic functions was evidenced
by the reduction of E/EΒΆ mitral scale and for the increase in ejection fraction
from 63.1 Β± 8.1% to 70.1 Β± 11.5% at the end of six months28.RSD has also shown a relevant improvement in scores evaluating the quality of
life three months after procedure. In the study, the subjective evaluation on
the quality of life of resistant hypertensive patients before the procedure, was
quite negative. It is worth noting that the improvement in the quality of life
was not directly associated with the magnitude of BP decrease29.Cost-effectiveness studies and estimates on clinical benefits in the
long-termBased on the results of the study Symplicity HTN-215, it was carried out an analysis of RSD
cost-effectiveness and its clinical impact in the long-term. Compared to
conventional treatment, RSD reduced the probability of cardiovascular and renal
outcomes (relative risk - RR - in 10 years/lifetime: 0.70/0.83 for CVA;
0.68/0.85 for AMI; 0.78/0.90 for all coronary events; 0.79/0.92 for heart
insufficiency and 0.72/0.81 for renal disease in the final stage). Estimated
mean survival in RSD group was of 18.4 years and in conventional treatment group
was of 17.1 years. The ratio of discounted incremental cost-effectiveness was of
U$3,071 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and was, therefore considered a
cost-effective strategy for RAH30.Another analysis revealed the cost-effectiveness in men and women of different
ages, and RSD resulted in a gain of 0.98 QALYs for men and 0.88 QALYs in women
aged 60, with an additional cost of β‚¬2,589 and β‚¬2,044, respectively, compared to
drug therapy. The younger the patient, the greater the gain in QALYs and the
lower the cost. This study pointed out that RSD would be cost-effective until 78
years old for men and 76 years old for women31.

Study limitations
his review is a result of an active research of scientific articles named
"renal denervation" at edline e ub. Med databases, considering
a limited number of published original articles and ongoing clinical trials. It
represents an exploratory phase of this new intervention method and, therefore, a
knowledge theme still in construction.
Future perspectives with RSDThe initial success of RSD technique on RAH, using radiofrequency stimulated the
appearance of other types of device, with very promising proposals and more
simplified handling and with a more homogeneous performance of RSD8,32. Other interesting techniques, such as renal
intra-arterial infusion of guanethidine, or renal periarterial infusion of
ethanol33, or
periarterial vincristine injection with Bullfrog micro-infusion
catheter8 are still
being tested for clinical use. Using non-specific catheters, used in ablation
techniques for heart arrhythmias, may represent lower cost to RSD procedure,
however, it has not yet been validated for its full scientific use22,23. Among future challenges, is the possibility of
performing a non-invasive denervation treatment, using Doppler pointed at renal
artery.Another demand for the future concerns the development of indicators for
immediate evaluation of the success of RSD procedure.Conducting robust, randomized, blinded studies in centers specialized in AH is
required to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety and the possible impact
on the reduction of morbidity and mortality. Simplicity HTN-334 ongoing study must contribute
this matter.Development of knowledge with the use of RSD for RAH could suggest potential use
in other conditions concurrent with sympathetic hyperactivity, such as: isolated
systolic hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal disease, heart insufficiency,
heart arrhythmias, sleep apnea and cirrhosis6.On the basis of limitations of clinical study results with RSD up to this moment
and the absence of more comprehensive studies on cost-effectiveness of the
procedure, its application in large scale is not yet to be recommended;
currently, it must be indicated only for true resistant hypertensive patients,
group of very high cardiovascular risk35. It is worth noting that, regardless of a positive
clinical result of RSD for RAH, the medical treatment must be based on the
combination of continued administration of medications, weight loss and change
of lifestyle for all patients1,2.
