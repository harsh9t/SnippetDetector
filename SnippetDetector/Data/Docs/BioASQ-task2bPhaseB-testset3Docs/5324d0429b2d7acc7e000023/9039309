<abstract>
Five women affected by androgenetic alopecia developed severe hypertrichosis of the face and limbs after 2-3 months of treatment with 5% topical minoxidil. Minoxidil was discontinued and in all patients the hypertrichosis disappeared from the face and arms after 1-3 months, and from legs after 4-5 months. Systemic absorption of minoxidil, and a high sensitivity to minoxidil of the follicular apparatus in these areas, is hypothesized.
