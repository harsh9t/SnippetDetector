<abstract>
Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) can be a frustrating condition to the patient and the practitioner because the patient often experiences a continuous burning pain in the mouth without any apparent clinical signs, but the practitioner is unable to definitively diagnose symptoms even with the use of diagnostic testing or imaging. To overcome this dilemma, it is important for the practitioner to recognize and understand the complexities of BMS. The practitioner can then develop a sound approach to management of this condition and patients can be educated and reassured regarding BMS.
