OBJECTIVES: The protective role of saliva in the case of oesophageal exposition to gastric acid has long been studied but some contradictions still remain. The main end-point of this study was to evaluate if a qualitative and quantitative alteration in salivary secretion exists in patients affected by GERD. METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients (T group) with clinically and endoscopically diagnosed GERD, and 98 healthy subjects (C group) have been evaluated; salivary tests (i.e. basal flow rate, stimulated flow rate, pH, [Na(+)] and [K(+)]) were performed, socio-demographical variables and oral GERD-related symptoms were taken into account. SPSS 10.5 software was used for statistical univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: GERD patients and controls were found to have a similar basal flow rate but different stimulated salivary function [T group mean value 0.989 ml/min (+/-0.48718) vs. C group 1.2197 ml/min (+/-0.6108), pH [T group mean value 8.935 (+/-0.471) vs. C group 7.879 (+/-0.526)] and a higher K(+) concentration. In GERD patients we also registered a significant association with xerostomia [69/120 (57.5%) vs. 28/98 (28.7%)] and an oral burning sensation [58/120 (48.3%) vs. 19/98 (19.3%)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings assess that salivary secretion is altered in GERD patients and highlight the need for further investigations in order to define the role of saliva in the etiopathogenesis of GERD.
