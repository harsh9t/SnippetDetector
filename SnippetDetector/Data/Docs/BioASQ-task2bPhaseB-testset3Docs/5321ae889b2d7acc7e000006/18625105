Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic disease characterized by burning of the oral mucosa associated with a sensation of dry mouth and/or taste alterations. BMS occurs more frequently among postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, and evidence is conflicting; although some studies suggest a central origin, others point to a peripheral neuropathic origin. The efficacy of some medications in the treatment of BMS suggests that the dopaminergic system may be involved.
