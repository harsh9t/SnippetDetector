Glossodynia (synonym: burning mouth syndrome) is thought to be a disorder with a wide range of possible causes. Aetiologies may include haematological diseases, vitamin deficiencies, dental work, hormonal factors, or infections. In addition, psychological disorders such as neuroses, depression, or phobias have been reported as playing a significant role in the initiation of burning mouth syndrome. Typically, the oral mucosa is found to be normal in most burning mouth syndrome patients. A multidisciplinary approach appears to be essential for appropriate assessment of this disorder, i.e. the diagnostic procedure should involve dentistry, neurology, and internal medicine. If possible, careful treatment of underlying causes must be undertaken. However, the replacement of suspected but unproven hormonal/nutritional deficiencies should be avoided.
