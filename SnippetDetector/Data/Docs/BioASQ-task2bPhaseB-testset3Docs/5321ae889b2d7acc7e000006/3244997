<abstract>
In these speculations of the future in gastro-esophageal reflux a hope is expressed that gastro-esophageal reflux disease is accepted as a separate entity. Treatment and diagnosis should not be confused with those of ulcer disease. Reflux disease is not a problem of too much acid in the stomach, but too much acid in the wrong place, the esophagus. The problem is mainly a leaking valve. Furthermore, the expression reflux like dyspepsia should be used when esophagitis or gastro-esophageal reflux disease is not established by endoscopy or pH-monitoring.
