Burning mouth syndrome represents a chronic orofacial pain disorder without an apparent lesion of oral mucosa. It affects 0.71-3.4% of general population. Although a lot of scientific and clinical effort has been undertaken, its genesis still remains an enigma. Potential etiologic roles of various oral and systemic factors have been implicated, such as oral candidiasis, hormonal, neurological, nutritive and psychiatric disorders. In spite of different treatment approaches and medications, therapeutic success is limited. Although in our country most of the patients are treated by dentists specialized in oral medicine, medical doctors should be more involved in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Article describes etiologic factors, diagnostic and therapeutic means in the burning mouth syndrome.
