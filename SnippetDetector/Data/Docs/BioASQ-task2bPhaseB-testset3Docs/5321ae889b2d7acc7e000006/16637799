Burning mouth syndrome is an oral dysaesthesia presenting as a burning sensation of the tongue and less frequently other oral and peri-oral sites. There may be other coincident symptoms and signs, but the defining feature is the absence of any obvious organic cause. Because of this the condition frequently remains unrecognized for extended periods with a variable progression of symptoms. The current paper describes the complex presentation of burning mouth syndrome with the major aim of increasing recognition.
