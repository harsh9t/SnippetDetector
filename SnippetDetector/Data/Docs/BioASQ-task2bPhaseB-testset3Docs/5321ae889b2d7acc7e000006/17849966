<abstract>
Burning in the mouth in and of itself is not all that uncommon. It may result from a variety of local or generalized oral mucosal disorders, or may be secondary to referred phenomena from other locations. Primary burning mouth syndrome, on the other hand, is relatively uncommon. Burning mouth syndrome is an idiopathic pain disorder, which appears to be neuropathic in origin. Thoughts on management of secondary and particularly primary burning mouth syndrome are discussed.
