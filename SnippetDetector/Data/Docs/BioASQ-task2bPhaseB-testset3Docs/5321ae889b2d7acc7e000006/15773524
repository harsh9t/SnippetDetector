Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a predominantly oral condition characterized by the occurrence of a chronic burning that commonly involves the anterior tongue, painful sensation, dryness and taste alterations. The syndrome is reported more often in women, usually without any oral mucosal signs and laboratory abnormalities. Its etiopathogenesis remains poorly understood, and there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies. Tongue burning is though to be also one of a non-oesophageal symptom of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. As reported below, although this symptom may well be diagnostically misleading, careful diagnosis based on clinical signs may distinguish patients with BMS from those with reflux disease, and successful management of burning mouth is often enables.
