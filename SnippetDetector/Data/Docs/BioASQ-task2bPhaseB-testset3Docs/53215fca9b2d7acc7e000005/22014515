Cristae junctions mark the boundaries of respiratory compartments in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this issue of Developmental Cell, von der Malsburg etÂ al. (2011) identify a complex, MINOS, that organizes cristae junctions. Mitofilin/Fcj1, the central component of the MINOS complex, also connects the inner membrane to outer membrane protein import machinery.
