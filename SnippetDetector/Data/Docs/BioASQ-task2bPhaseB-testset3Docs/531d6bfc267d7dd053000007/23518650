Clostridium botulinum type A toxin is the most prevalent cause of naturally occurring outbreaks of human botulism in the world. The active dichain neurotoxin molecule is composed of a heavy chain (H-chain) of ~100 kDa with the carboxy-terminal end consisting of a receptor-binding (HC) domain, while the amino-terminal (HN) domain is linked by a critical disulfide bond to a light chain (L-chain) of ~50 kDa. Although the mouse bioassay (MBA) is traditionally used to confirm the presence of toxin in serum or food, its sensitivity is insufficient to detect low toxin levels in approximately 30 to 60 % of botulism patients. A novel FDC (functional dual coating) microtitre plate immuno-biochemical assay, which quantifies botulinum toxicity by measuring the HC domain linked with L-chain endopeptidase activity, was modified to allow human serum (lysed or unlysed) to be tested without interference from the matrix, with toxin detection down to 0.03 mouse LD50 per ml serum or 0.13 pg ml(-1) using just 100 µl of clinical samples. The assay was specific for type A toxin and could additionally be applied to whole blood and food samples. Low levels of 1 to 2 mouse LD50 per ml serum of type A toxin were quantified for the first time using the modified FDC assay in two severely intoxicated UK patients who required mechanical ventilation and antitoxin. Toxin levels in recovered food sample extracts were also detected and one MBA-negative sample was found to contain 0.32 LD50 per ml extract. The FDC assay provides a real alternative for public health laboratories to unambiguously confirm all cases of type A botulism and, due to its sensitivity, a promising new tool in toxin pharmacokinetic studies.
