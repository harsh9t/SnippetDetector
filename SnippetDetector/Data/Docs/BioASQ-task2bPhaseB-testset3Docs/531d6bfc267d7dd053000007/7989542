We studied the effectiveness of the PCR in detecting the type A, B, and E botulism neurotoxin genes in 209 strains of Clostridium botulinum and 29 strains of other Clostridium spp. All 79 strains that produced type A toxin, 77 strains that produced type B toxin, and 51 organisms that produced type E toxin (46 C. botulinum and 5 C. butyricum) were PCR positive in reactions with primers targeting sequences specific for their respective toxin genes. The PCR for type A toxin was positive for one type B toxin-producing strain that produced a small amount of type A toxin in addition to a large amount of type B toxin. Surprisingly, the type B toxin gene was detected in addition to the type A toxin gene in 43 type A toxin-producing strains, only 1 of which could be shown by bioassay to produce biologically active type B toxin in culture. The type B gene was also detected in two strains of C. subterminale, which were determined to be nontoxigenic by bioassay. While the PCR was sensitive and specific in detecting the neurotoxin genes, the discovery of unexpressed toxin genes indicates that PCR results may not be adequate for establishing type B neurotoxigenicity.
