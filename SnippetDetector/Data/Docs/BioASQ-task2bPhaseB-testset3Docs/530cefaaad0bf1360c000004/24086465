It has recently been determined that not only Aβ oligomers, but also other Aβ species and amyloidogenic peptides are neurotoxic in Alzheimer disease (AD) and play a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis. In the present study, we attempted to develop new DNA vaccines targeting a wide range of Aβ species. For this purpose, we first performed in vitro assays with newly developed vaccines to evaluate Aβ production and Aβ secretion abilities and then chose an IgL-Aβx4-Fc-IL-4 vaccine (designated YM3711) for further studies. YM3711 was vaccinated to mice, rabbits and monkeys to evaluate anti-Aβ species antibody-producing ability and Aβ reduction effects. It was found that YM3711 vaccination induced significantly higher levels of antibodies not only to Aβ1-42 but also to AD-related molecules including AβpE3-42, Aβ oligomers and Aβ fibrils. Importantly, YM3711 significantly reduced these Aβ species in the brain of model mice. Binding and competition assays using translated YM3711 protein products clearly demonstrated that a large part of antibodies induced by YM3711 vaccination are directed at conformational epitopes of the Aβ complex and oligomers. Taken together, we demonstrate that YM3711 is a powerful DNA vaccine targeting a wide range of AD-related molecules and is worth examining in preclinical and clinical trials.

Alzheimerβ€™s disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related cognitive decline, affecting more than 12 million people worldwide. The disease is characterized by progressive memory impairment, cognitive decline, altered behavior and language deficit. Later, patients show global amnesia and slowing of motor function, and finally death [1]. It is generally believed that accumulation of amyloid beta (AΞ²) is the first event in the pathogenesis of AD, followed by tau phosphorylation, tangle formation and neuronal death (amyloid cascade hypothesis) [2], [3]. Therefore, deposited or depositing AΞ² should be the first target of AD therapy.
Recently, several immunotherapies have been developed as curative treatments of AD by targeting the underlying cause. In 1999, Schenk and his colleagues demonstrated that monthly inoculation with synthetic AΞ² in adjuvants could lead to high anti-AΞ² antibody titers and dramatic reductions of AΞ² deposition in PDAPP transgenic mice [4]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that clearance of AΞ² deposits following immunization protected amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice from developing memory deficits [5], [6]. Approximately 50% reduction in AΞ² plaques is sufficient to ameliorate cognition [7]. Based on the promising results using model mice, clinical trials with an AΞ² peptide vaccine, AN1792, were started. However, a phase II-A study was halted due to the development of meningoencephalitis in 18 of 298 patients (6%) who received the vaccine [8].
The outcome of AΞ² immunotherapies is controversial. Autopsy of an AN1792-treated patient revealed a significant reduction of AΞ² plaques compared with unimmunized patients [9]. However, Holms et al. reported later that although AN1792 immunization resulted in clearance of AΞ² plaques, this clearance did not prevent progressive neurodegeneration [10]. Since these studies were performed in a relatively small scale and the number of autopsied patients was too small, it is essential to obtain more information to draw final conclusion. Recently, it was reported that AN1792 immunization provided beneficial effects on neurite morphology and tau pathology [11]. Furthermore, clinical trials with a humanized anti-AΞ² monoclonal antibody, Bapineuzumab, revealed that the treatment improved cognitive decline and retarded the brain volume loss in APOE4 non-carrier patients [12].
Progress in understanding pathomechanisms of AD revealed that not only AΞ²1-42, but also other AΞ² species and amyloidogenic peptides that have no amino acid homology to AΞ² are involved in neurotoxicity in the brain [13]. Based on such information, the present study was undertaken to develop DNA vaccines targeting a wide range of AΞ² species and amyloidogenic peptides and succeeded in reducing AΞ² and AΞ² species with a newly developed DNA vaccine, YM3711.

Results
² etramer tructure and ddition of mmunoglobulin c ortion pregulate ²-protein omplex roduction and its ecretion into the xtracellular pace. It has recently been determined that in Alzheimer disease, not only AΞ² dimers and oligomers, but also posttranslationally modified AΞ² species and other amyloidogenic peptides are neurotoxic [14], [15]. In the present study, we attempted to develop new DNA vaccines targeting these molecules. For this purpose, we employed the tandem-repeats of AΞ² to increase the antibody production ability and to induce wide-range antibodies for AΞ² species. Addition of the Fc portion of immunoglobulin and IL-4 was performed to upregulate the extracellular movement of the AΞ²-Fc complex and to upregulate antibody production, respectively (Fig. 1A).10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g001Figure 1DNA vaccines prepared and examined in the present study (A) and effects of the tandem structure (B) and addition of Fc (C) in vitro potency assay.(A) AΞ²x4, four-repeated AΞ²1-42 sequence; hu Fc, human Fc portion of immunoglobulin; hu IL-4, human IL-4 sequence. (B and C) HEK293 cells were cultured and transfected with the indicated DNA vaccines. The supernatant and cell pellet of transfected cells were harvested and subjected to AΞ² quantitation using the Human Ξ² Amyloid (1-42) ELISA Kit Wako, High-Sensitive according to the manufacturerβ€™s instruction. Sup and sup (10Γ—) indicate unconcentrated and concentrated supernatant, respectively. Mean values of triplicate assay are shown.The indicated vaccines were transfected to cultured cells and the amount of AΞ² in the supernatant and cell pellet were determined by a sandwich ELISA (Fig. 1B and 1C). It was clearly demonstrated that AΞ² tetramer structure (Fig. 1B) and addition of immunoglobulin Fc portion (Fig. 1C) upregulated AΞ²-protein complex production (cell pellet) and its secretion into the extracellular space (sup). Based on these results, we chose IgL-AΞ²x4-huFc-huIL-4 (Fig. 1A, code, YM3711) for further experiments.We also performed in vitro studies to characterize the nature of YM3711. In the transfection assay, a sufficient amount of the YM3711 product was secreted in the culture medium compared with AΞ²x1-huIL-4 (Fig. 2A). The product was electrophoresed, blotted and immunostained with anti-AΞ² (Fig. 2B), anti-Fc (Fig. 2C) and anti-IL-4 (Fig. 2D). Immunostaining for AΞ² and Fc revealed one band for YM3711 products (estimated molecular size, 58 kDa) (lane 1 in Fig. 2B and 2C). IL-4 staining also revealed one band (ca 58 kDa) in the supernatant of YM3711-transfected cells (an arrow in lanes 1 of Fig. 2D), but not in the supernatant of untransfected cells (lane 2), corresponding to the band for recombinant IL-4 (ca 14 kDa) (lane 3, arrowhead). The upper band in lane 3 was judged to be a dimer according to its molecular size (ca 28 kDa). We also evaluated IL-4 bioactivities of the culture supernatant of YM3711-transfected cells using an IL-4-dependent cell line. As shown in Fig. 2E, the supernatant (blue bar, labeled as sample) contained active IL-4 compatible to 0.06 ng/ml recombinant IL-4. Open red bars indicate serial diluted recombinant IL-4. The culture supernatant of untransfected cells showed IL-4 activities corresponding to 0.0002 ng/ml (gree bar, NC). Thus, it was demonstrated that translated YM3711 product showed significant IL-4 bioactivities (Fig. 2E).10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g002Figure 2In vitro characterization of YM3711.(A) Quantitation of AΞ² production in the culture supernatant of YM3711- or AΞ²x1-IL-4-transfected cells by sandwich ELISA.

IL-4 staining also revealed one band (ca 58 kDa) in the supernatant of YM3711-transfected cells (an arrow in lanes 1), but not in the supernatant of untransfected cells (lane 2) corresponding to the band for recombinant IL-4 (ca 14 kDa) (lane 3, arrowhead). The upper band in lane 3 was judged to be a dimer according to its molecular size (ca 28 kDa). (E) IL-4 bioassay of the supernatant of YM-3711-transfected cells. IL-4 activities were determined by bioassay using an IL-4-dependent cell line, TF-1. The supernatant of YM3711-transfected cells contained active IL-4 compatible to 0.06 ng/ml human recombinant IL-4 (blue bar, sample). The culture supernatant of untransfected culture cells showed IL-4 activities corresponding to 0.0002 ng/ml (green bar, NC). Open red bars indicate serially diluted recombinant IL-4.In vivo Administration of YM3711 Reduces not only AΞ²1-42 but also other AΞ² Species in Model MiceYM3711 at a dose of 100 Βµg was injected weekly to B6C3-Tg (APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo/J mice (hereafter referred to as Tg mice in the present study) for 6 weeks and the brain and plasma were taken at 8 weeks. Immunostaining for AΞ² in the brain revealed that compared with untreated control mice (Fig. 3A), AΞ² deposits in the frontal cortex were clearly decreased in vaccinated mice (Fig. 3B). Quantitative analysis by sandwich ELISA (Fig. 3Cβ€“3F) demonstrated a significant reduction of AΞ²1-42 in treated mice (Fig. 4C) (pβ€�=β€�0.0254). Furthermore, AΞ²pE3-42 (Fig. 3D) and AΞ² oligomer (Fig. 3E) quantitation revealed significant reduction in the YM3711-treated group (pβ€�=β€�0.0433 and pβ€�=β€�0.0074, respectively). In addition, AΞ² species that are recognized by anti-amyloid fibrils, OC, were semiquantitated by measuring densities of 56 kD band (Fig. 3F). It was found that AΞ² fibrils were significantly reduced in treated Tg mice than in control Tg mice (pβ€�=β€�0.01).10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g003Figure 3YM3711 vaccination effectively reduced not only AΞ²1-42 but also other AΞ² species.YM3711 at a dose of 100 Βµg was injected weekly to 15-month old model mice for 6 weeks and the brain and plasma were taken at 8 weeks. Immunostaining for AΞ² revealed that compared with untreated control mice (A), AΞ² deposits in the frontal cortex were clearly decreased in vaccinated mice (B). Barβ€�=β€�100 Βµm. Quantitative analysis by sandwich ELISA (Cβ€“E) demonstrated the significant reduction of AΞ²1-42 in treated mice (C) (pβ€�=β€�0.0254). AΞ²pE3-42 (D) and AΞ² oligomer (E) quantitation also revealed significant reduction in the YM3711-treated group (pβ€�=β€�0.0433 and pβ€�=β€�0.0074, respectively). AΞ² species that are recognized by anti-amyloid fibrils, OC, were semiquantitated by measuring densities of 56 kD band (F). AΞ² fibrils were significantly reduced in treated Tg mice than in control Tg mice (pβ€�=β€�0.01). Closed and open columns indicate the amount of AΞ² species in the cerebral cortex of vaccinated mice (nβ€�=β€�4) and of age-matched control mice (nβ€�=β€�5), respectively.10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g004Figure 4Presence or absence of antibodies against vaccine components by YM3711 vaccination.Monkeys (nβ€�=β€�4) were injected with YM3711 six times and the presence or absence of antibodies against vaccine components such as AΞ², human Fc and human IL-4 was determined. It was clearly demonstrated that YM3711 vaccination induced antibodies against AΞ² components vigorously (left panel), while anti-Fc and anti-IL-4 antibodies were not observed in all the samples examined (middle and right panels).YM3711 Vaccination Induced Antibodies against AΞ², but not against other Components of the VaccineWe first examined the presence or absence of antibodies against vaccine components other than AΞ², i.e. human Fc and IL-4 (Fig. 4). Monkeys were injected with YM3711 six times and the presence or absence of antibodies against vaccine components such as AΞ², human Fc and human IL-4 was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, it was clearly demonstrated that YM3711 vaccination induced antibodies against AΞ² components vigorously (Fig. 4, left panel), while anti-Fc and anti-IL-4 antibodies were not observed in all the samples examined (Fig. 4, middle and right panels). This was probably because Fc and IL-4 are present in monkeys for life time and very similar between humans and monkeys in terms of the amino acid sequence. Therefore, monkeys may be in a tolerant state to exogenous human Fc and IL-4.YM3711 Induces Antibodies against AΞ² Species and Amyloidogenic PeptidesTo establish newly developed therapeutics, it is essential to examine the efficacy and safety of candidate drugs in large animals, such as rabbits and monkeys. This is because drugs that are effective in mice and rats are not always effective in large animals. Rabbits (3 rabbits per group) were immunized with either IgL-AΞ²-Fc-IL-4 (AΞ²x1 Vax, Rabbits #1, #2 and #3) or IgL-AΞ²x4-Fc-IL-4 (YM3711, Rabbits #4, #5 and #6) once a week for 6 weeks (Fig. 5) and preimmune (open bars) and postimmune final (closed bars) plasma was collected and the titers of antibodies against AΞ²1-42 (Fig. 5A), AΞ²1-11 (Fig. 5B), AΞ²17-42 (Fig. 5C), pyroglutamate-modified AΞ² (AΞ²pE3-42) (Fig. 5D) and ABri (Fig. 5E) were determined by ELISA. While anti-AΞ²1-42 antibodies were elevated in one of three rabbits that had been injected with IgL-AΞ²-Fc-IL-4 vaccine (left half of panel A), all the rabbits immunized with YM3711 (right half of panel A) showed significant increase of the antibodies. Anti-AΞ²1-11 antibodies were found only in the YM3711 group (panel B) and the titers of anti-AΞ²17-42 were higher in the AΞ²x1 Vax groups (panel C). It should be noted that antibodies against a posttranslationally modified AΞ² species, AΞ²pE3-42, were significantly elevated only in the YM3711 group (panel D). YM3711, but not AΞ²x1 Vax, induced anti-ABri antibodies (panel E). Similarly, YM3711 vaccination induced high titers of anti-AΞ² antibodies in monkeys (data not shown).10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g005Figure 5YM3711 vaccination induced antibodies not only to AΞ² species but also to an unrelated amyloidogenic peptide.Rabbits (3 rabbits per group) were immunized with either IgL-AΞ²-Fc-IL-4 (Ax1 Vax, Rabbits #1, #2 and #3) or IgL-AΞ²x4-Fc-IL-4 (YM3711, Rabbits #4, #5 and #6) once a week for 6 weeks and preimmune (open bars) and postimmune final (closed bars) plasma was collected and the titers of antibodies against AΞ²1-42 (A), AΞ²1-11 (B), AΞ²17-42 (C), AΞ²pE3-42 (D) and ABri (E) were determined by ELISA. O.D. values and percent increase of each assay are shown. To avoid inter-assay variations, all the samples to be compared were examined in the same assay.We also examined whether YM3711 vaccination induces antibodies against AΞ² oligomers (Fig. 6). In Rabbit #5, anti-AΞ² trimer antibodies, which detected a 12 kDa band, were evident in postimmune plasma in addition to anti-monomer antibodies, which detected a 4 kDa band. Anti-tetramer and pentamer antibodies became visible after YM3711 vaccination. Antibodies to ADDL (AΞ²-derived diffusible ligand) were also detectable. Antibody elevation in Rabbit #6 was slightly weak compared with Rabbit #5 but a similar antibody profile was recognizable (Fig. 6, right half). Similar analysis was made using soluble AΞ² extracted from brain tissue of model mice (Fig. 6B). As clearly seen, 7-mer (ca 28 kDa) and 13-mer (ca 52 kDa) AΞ² oligomers were stained with vaccinated, but not preimmune, plasma, again indicating that YM3711 induces antibodies against AΞ² oligomers. Collectively, YM3711 vaccination induces antibodies not only to a variety of AΞ² species but also to an unrelated (in terms of the amino acid sequence) amyloidogenic peptide.10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g006Figure 6Induction of anti-AΞ² oligomer antibodies by YM3711 vaccination.(A) In Rabbit #5, anti-AΞ² trimer antibodies were detected in postimmune plasma in addition to anti-monomer antibodies. Anti-tetramer and pentamer antibodies became visible after YM3711 vaccination. Antibodies to ADDL (AΞ²-derived diffusible ligand) were also detectable. Antibody elevation in Rabbit #6 was slightly weak compared with Rabbit #5 but a similar antibody profile was recognizable (right half). AΞ² oligomers were prepared using synthetic peptides. (B) Rabbit #5 plasma stained 7mer and 13mer AΞ² oligomers. AΞ² oligomers were extracted from brain tissues of Tg mice.Characterization of YM3711 Products (YM3711P) and Antibodies Induced by YM3711 VaccinationAs shown above, YM3711 vaccination induced antibodies not only to AΞ²1-42, but also to a variety of AΞ² species and amyloidogenic peptides unrelated to AΞ² in terms of the amino acid sequence. We hypothesized that antibodies induced by YM3711 vaccination direct not only at AΞ² molecules but also at conformational epitopes, which are common to AΞ² oligomers and amyloidogenic peptides. To further characterize the nature of YM3711-derived AΞ²-protein complex and YM711-induced antibodies, we first purified YM3711 products (YM3711P) (Fig. 7A) and performed binding and competition assays. For the binding assay, YM3211P obtained from the culture supernatant of YM3711-transfected HEK 239 cells were coated onto 96-well plates. Then, biotinylated IgG purified from plasma of rabbits that had been vaccinated with YM3711 and HRP-labeled VECTSTAIN Elite ABC were applied. The results are summarized in Fig. 7B. Purified IgG contained high titers of anti-YM3711P antibodies, whereas anti-AΞ²1-42 antibodies were very low. This finding strongly suggests that a large part of antibodies in YM3711-vaccinated rabbits direct at conformational epitopes of the AΞ² complex.10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g007Figure 7Purification of YM3711 products (YM3711P) (A) and binding (B) and competition (C) assays using YM3711P.(A) YM3711 was transfected to floating HEK293 cells using the FreeStyle 293 Expression System. After 4 day culture, the supernatant was harvested and filtered. Then, YM3711P were purified with an affinity column (HiTrap NHS-activated HP column) coupled with anti-AΞ²1-42 antibodies. The eluate was evaluated by Western blotting with 6E10 mAb. (B) Binding assay. YM3711P at concentrations of 2 Βµg/ml (diamonds), 10 Βµg/ml (squares) and 20 Βµg/ml (triangles) or AΞ²1-42 (2 Βµg/ml, circles) were coated onto microtiter wells. After blocking, biotinylated IgG purified from plasma of rabbits that had been vaccinated with YM3711 were applied and followed by HRP-labeled VECTSTAIN Elite ABC Kit. Samples showing O.D. more than 2.5 were further diluted and reexamined. Calculated O.D. values are shown in Panel B. (C) Competition assay. YM3711P at a concentration of 2 Βµg/ml was applied onto microtiter wells. Then, wells were incubated with a mixture of biotinylated anti-YM3711P IgG and unlabeled various competitors at 0.1 to 100 ratios. Competitors included 6E10 (diamonds), 4G8 (squares), anti-AΞ²pE3-42 antibodies (triangles) and unlabeled anti-YM3711P IgG (circles). An asterisk indicates that higher concentration of the reagent was not available.Then, we performed a competition assay (Fig. 7C). Microtiter wells coated with YM3711P were incubated with a mixture of biotinylated anti-YM3711P IgG and various unlabeled competitors at 0.1 to 100 ratios. As expected, cold anti-YM3711 IgG showed strong competing abilities in a dose-dependent manner, whereas two anti-AΞ² mAbs and anti-AΞ²pE3-42 antibodies exhibited relatively weak competing abilities.Antibodies Raised by YM3711 Vaccination Bind to Amyloid PlaquesFindings obtained so far strongly suggest that antibodies induced by YM3711 vaccination direct largely at the conformational epitope of the AΞ² complex (oligomers, fibrils and plaques). To confirm this possibility, we performed the tissue amyloid plaque immunoreactivity (TAPIR) assay. As shown in Fig. 8A, YM3711-induced antibodies stained AΞ² plaques positively. Interestingly, the antibodies also stained intracellular AΞ² (indicated by arrows in Fig. 8A). When we performed TAPIR assay, sections were pretreated with formic acid or microwaving or left untreated. Fig. 8B summarizes the results. First, untreated sections were stained positively, suggesting that the antibodies recognize the surface structure of the AΞ² complex. Second, microwave pretreatment which was reported to enhance intracellular AΞ² staining [16] work well in this assay. Absorption of plasma taken from YM3711-vaccinated mice resulted in loss of specific staining (data not shown). These findings suggest that antibodies raised by YM3711 vaccination are able to access both extracellular and intracellular AΞ² deposits.10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g008Figure 8Tissue Amyloid Plaque Immunoreactivity (TAPIR) Assay.(A) Paraffin-embedded brains sections of Tg mice were incubated with plasma taken from animals that had been immunized with YM3711. Samples were diluted 1β�¶100 to 1β�¶1,000. After washing, sections were incubated with cy3-conjugated or biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by HRP-labeled Vestastain Elite ABC kit. Intracellular AΞ² immunoreactivities are indicated by arrows. Brain sections taken from five Tg mice were stained and the representative results are shown. (B) Immunoreactivity scores were graded into the following categories: absent immunoreactivity, (β�’); weak immunoreactivity, (+); moderate immunoreactivity, (++); and strong immunoreactivity, (+++).Demonstration of the Absence of T-cell Infiltration in the Brains of Tg and Wild-type Mice Treated with YM3711Finally, we examined the presence or absence of adverse effects of DNA vaccination such as neuroinflammation and microhemorrhage. Careful examination of the cerebrum including the cerebral cortex (Fig. 9A) and the hippocampus (Fig. 9B) of vaccinated Tg mice revealed no infiltrating T cells. Similarly, there was no T cell infiltration in the brain of wild-type mice (Fig. 9C and 9D). In the spleen and thymus that had been co-stained as positive control, there were many CD5-positive cells (Fig. 9E and 9F). These findings indicate that repeated YM3711 administration did not induce neuroinflammation in treated mice. There was no microhemorrhage in brains of vaccinated mice (data not shown).10.1371/journal.pone.0075203.g009Figure 9Immunohistochemical examination of the presence or absence of infiltrating T cells in the brains of YM3711-vaccinated Tg mice.Tg and wild-type mice that had been immunized six times with YM3711 were examined immunohistochemically. The number of mice examined is as follows; 18 Tg mice and 4 wild-type mice. Three slices of each cerebrum were sectioned after paraffin embedding. Careful examination of the cerebrum including the cerebral cortex (A) and the hippocampus (B) of vaccinated Tg mice revealed no infiltrating T cells. Similarly, there was no T cell infiltration in the brain of wild-type mice (C and D). In the spleen and thymus that had been co-stained as positive control, there were many CD5-positive cells (E and F).

Discussion
nti-² immunotherapies have been developed as a promising therapeutic tool for treatment of  (reviewed in [17]). lthough the first trial with an ² peptide vaccine, 1792, was halted due to the development of meningoencephalitis in some treated patients, autopsy performed later revealed a significant reduction of ² plaques compared with unimmunized patients [9]. owever, olms et al. later reported that although 1792 immunization resulted in clearance of ² plaques, this clearance did not prevent progressive neurodegeneration [10]. ince these studies were performed in a relatively small scale and the number of autopsied patients was too small, it is essential to obtain more information to draw final conclusion. ecently, it was reported that 1792 immunization provided beneficial effects, not only on ² pathology, but also on neurite morphology and tau pathology [11]. urthermore, clinical trials with a humanized anti-² monoclonal antibody, bapineuzumab, revealed that the treatment improved cognitive decline and retarded the brain volume loss in 4 non-carrier patients [12]. ollectively, it is essential to start anti-² therapies at a very early stage, even before the mild cognitive impairment stage, as discussed elsewhere [18], [19].
t has recently become recognized that  is a β€�conformational disease.β€� n other words, several ² species and amyloidogenic peptides are involved in the development and progression of . nterestingly, these molecules, including ²1-40, ²9-42, ²17-40/42, ri and an, form amyloid ion channels that destabilize cellular ionic homeostasis and induce cell degeneration in amyloid diseases [20], [21]. lthough, to our knowledge, there is no report on whether ²p. E3-42 forms ion channels, it is highly possible that this is the case, as in other pyroglutamated molecules, such as ABri and ADan. Interestingly, in model mice, AΞ²pE plaques increase with age, while the density of other AΞ² plaques decreases with aging [22]. This finding suggests that AΞ²pE plaques are more resistant to age-dependent degradation than other plaques. Inhibition of glutaminyl cyclase that mediates N-terminal pE formation attenuates AD pathology [15]. Therefore, it is essential to reduce not only AΞ²1-40/42 and their oligomers, but also other AΞ² species and amyloidogenic peptides by immunotherapies to obtain beneficial effects on AD.
There have been relatively few attempts to inhibit AΞ² aggregation or to develop immunotherapies targeting abnormal protein conformation. Tjernberg et al. first found that a short AΞ² fragment can bind full-length AΞ² and prevent its assembly into amyloid fibrils [23]. Later, it was demonstrated that several short peptides, termed as Ξ²-sheet breakers, inhibited Ξ²-sheet formation [24], [25]. Recently, immunization with polymerized British amyloidosis (ABri) related peptide, which has no amino acid sequence homology to AΞ², was shown to reduce AΞ² burden and improved cognitive decline in Alzheimer model mice [13].
In the present study, we have developed several new DNA vaccines and extensively characterized the most effective one, YM3711. In vitro studies demonstrated that YM3711 (pVAX-IgL-AΞ²x4-Fc-IL-4) was transcribed, translated and secreted as one molecule and the added IL-4 sequence exhibited bioactivities. YM3711 effectively induced antibodies in mice, rabbits and monkeys not only to AΞ² oligomers, but also to posttranslationally modified AΞ² species and other amyloidogenic peptides, which are reported to be neurotoxic [14], [15]. Importantly, vaccination with YM3711 significantly reduced the levels of AΞ²1-42, AΞ²pE3-42, AΞ² oligomers and AΞ² fibrils in Tg mice. Binding and competition assays using YM3711 protein products clearly demonstrated that a large part of antibodies induced by YM3711 vaccination are directed at conformational epitopes of AΞ² species and amyloidogenic peptide. Thus, we have successfully produced a DNA vaccine, YM3711 that induces antibodies against a wide variety of AΞ² and AΞ² species and reduces AΞ² deposits without obvious adverse effects.
Very recently, the role of tau in AD became clear and the fyn-tau-amyloid triad seems to be the center of AD pathogenesis [26]. Ittner et al. demonstrated that, using mice expressing truncated tau and tau-deficient mice, tau confers AΞ² toxicity at the postsynapse by activating a tyrosine kinase, fyn [27]. It was also shown that AΞ²/fyn-induced synaptic, network and cognitive impairments, depending on tau levels [28], [29]. Collectively, phosphorylated tau plays a pivotal role in neurotoxicity but it is less likely that tau shows direct neurotoxic effects. Therefore, AΞ² and AΞ²-related molecules should be the first target of immunotherapies. However, it is an open question whether anti-tau therapies in conjunction with anti-AΞ² therapies are necessary. DNA vaccines have an advantage over other immunotherapies because it is easy to design and modify vaccines in order to add new functions. We are currently preparing several types of AΞ²/tau DNA vaccines and will evaluate their efficacies using AΞ²/tau model mice.
In summary, we developed a new DNA vaccine (YM3711, IgL-AΞ²x4-Fc-IL-4) and found that it induced antibodies against a wide variety of AΞ² species and other amyloidogenic peptides, resulting in significant reduction of these molecules in the brain of AD model mice. Thus, YM3711 vaccine is worth further examinations in preclinical and clinical trials.

thic tatement. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 2011). Experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. Details of animal welfare and steps taken to ameliorate suffering are included in the methods section of the manuscript.AnimalsB6C3-Tg (APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo/J mice (hereafter referred to as Tg mice) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in our animal facilities. Tg and wild-type mice at ages between 13 and 15 weeks old were used for the study. Up to six mice were maintained in a cage under conventional conditions. Experimental procedures were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. New Zealand white rabbits were obtained from Japan SLC Inc. Individual rabbits were maintained in a cage. Pentobarbital was used for anesthesia of rabbits. Male (nβ€�=β€�3 for each group) and female (nβ€�=β€�3 for each group) cynomolgus monkeys aged between 3 and 5 years old were used for the study. Ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) was used for anesthesia of monkeys.Animal ConditionsMonkeys were individually housed in stainless steel cages (W750Γ—D750Γ—H700 mm) in an animal room which maintained the temperature at 23Β±5Β°C, the relative humidity at 55Β±25%, the air ventilation at 9 to 15 times per hour and 12-hour illumination per day (07β�¶00 to 19β�¶00). Pelleted diet PS for monkeys (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.) was given every day (150 g/day) at a set time between 11β�¶00 and 13β�¶50 (2 hours after administration or thereafter on the days of administration). The remaining feed was removed in the following morning. Monkeys were allowed free access to drinking water via an automatic water supply system. Examiners frequently accessed to monkeys to maintain good relationship but other enrichment of the monkeyβ€™s environment such as toys and periodic access to larger enclosures was not performed.After the end of the observation period, all animals were euthanized by exsanguination under appropriate anesthesia and subjected to pathological examinations.For moribund animals and animals that it is judged appropriate to euthanize from the standpoint of animal welfare, the animals will be euthanized and subjected to pathological examinations. However, there were no such animals in this study.Development of New DNA Vaccines and in vitro CharacterizationIn a previous study [30], we found that IgL-AΞ² and IgL-AΞ²-Fc DNA vaccines (listed in Fig. 1A) effectively reduced AΞ² deposits in model mice without side effects such as neuroinflammation and microhemorrhages. Based on the results obtained, we produced several vaccines consisting of various combinations of AΞ², Fc and IL-4 to establish safer and more effective vaccine therapy (Fig. 1A). Preliminary and present studies revealed that the IgL-AΞ²x4-Fc DNA vaccine (Code, YM3711) was most effective.For in vitro characterization, 4 Βµg of the indicated DNA vaccine was mixed with 10 Βµl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM I and the mixture was added to cultured HEK293 cells and the plates were cultured for 4 h. After washing, the cells were further cultured for 3 days. Then, the supernatant and cell pellet of transfected cells were harvested and subjected to AΞ² quantitation using the Human Ξ² Amyloid (1-42) ELISA Kit Wako, High-Sensitive (Wako, Osaka) according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions. OD450 was read with ARVO X3 (PerkinElmer Japan, Kanagawa).IL-4 activities were determined by bioassay using an IL-4-dependent cell line, TF-1. Culture supernatant of YM-3711-transfected cells or recombinant human IL-4 at various concentrations was added to cultured TF-1 cells. Culture supernatant of non-transfected cells served as negative controls. Using the BrdU uptake assay, the level of bioactive IL-4 was determined. IL-4 activities of the supernatant were determined based on values obtained from serially diluted IL-4.DNA VaccinationFor in vivo vaccination, YM3711 at doses of 100 Βµg for mice, 1 mg for rabbits and 4 mg for monkeys was administered intramuscularly at the indicated time points. Unless otherwise indicated, animals received six biweekly injections. Blood was drawn before and after vaccination and titers of antibodies against the indicated AΞ²-related peptides were determined by standard ELISA. At the end of experiments, treated and control animals were killed under deep anesthesia and the brains were removed for examination.ImmunohistochemistryParaformaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded brain sections were stained with mAb (6F/3D) against AΞ²8-17 (DAKO). Sections were pretreated in formic acid for 7 min and then incubated in 6F/3D followed by biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled Vestastain Elite ABC kit (Vector, Funakoshi). HRP-binding sites were detected in 0.005% diaminobenzidine and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. For confocal microscopic analysis, FITC or Cy-3 anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody.When mouse sections were stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies, the Mouse-On-Mouse (M.O.M.) Detection Kit (Vector) was used according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions. In brief, sections were incubated in M.O.M. Mouse Ig Blocking Reagent for 60 min and further incubated with 6F/3D or anti-CD5 antibody overnight followed by incubation with M.O.M. Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled VECTSTAIN Elite ABC Kit (Vector). In order to obtain the optimal conditions for T cell staining, mouse spleen sections were co-stained with anti-CD5.Tissue Amyloid Plaque Immunoreactivity (TAPIR) AssayTAPIR assay was performed according to the methods by Hock et al. [31]. Paraffin-embedded brains sections of Tg mice were incubated with plasma taken from rabbits that had been immunized with YM3711. Samples were diluted 1β�¶100 to 1β�¶1,000. After washing, sections were incubated with Cy3-conjugated or biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by HRP-labeled Vestastain Elite ABC kit. For immunofluorescent staining, sections were observed with a confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus). Immunoreactivities of immunohistochemically stained sections were visualized as described above. Immunoreactivity scores were graded into the following categories: absent immunoreactivity, (β�’); weak immunoreactivity, (+); moderate immunoreactivity, (++); and strong immunoreactivity, (+++).Measurement of Brain AΞ² and Anti-AΞ² Antibodies in PlasmaFor measurement of antibodies against AΞ² species and amyloidogenic peptides, microtiter plates were coated with the indicated peptides (2 Βµg/ml) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) for 4 hours at room temperature. After washing, plates were incubated over night at 4Β°C with serially diluted plasma samples in PBS. The plates were washed and incubated with horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using SIGMA FAST (Sigma-Aldrich) and the absorbance at 450 nm was read on an automated plate reader (Model 550; Bio-Rad laboratories). Titers of anti-human Fc and anti-human IL-4 antibodies were determined in a similar way using human IgG-Fc fragment (Bethyl) and recombinant human IL-4 (Preimmune Inc.) as antigens. To avoid inter-assay variations, all the samples to be compared were assayed at once.The amount of AΞ² and related molecules was quantitated by a sandwich ELISA, Human Amyloid Ξ² (1-42, pE3-42 or Oligomers) Immunoassay Kit (IBL, Takasaki, Japan), according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions. The brain tissue was homogenized in a guanidine-HCl buffer and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. An appropriate amount of the brain extract was subjected to the assay.Western Blot Analysis of Anti-AΞ² Oligomer Antibodies in Vaccinated AnimalsLyophilized AΞ²1-42 peptide (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan) was suspended in 1 mM HFIP (Hexafluoroisopropanol; Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 2 h at room temperature. The HFIP was allowed to evaporate in the fume hood and the resulting clear peptide films were dried with nitrogen gas. The HFIP-treated aliquots were resuspended to 5 mM in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide; Nakalai Tesque). AΞ² oligomers were prepared by diluting AΞ²1-42 peptide to 100 ΒµM with phenol red-free RPMI medium (Invitrogen), incubating at 37Β°C for 24 h.Soluble AΞ² oligomers were also extracted from frozen brain tissue of model mice. The tissue homogenate in TBS/Calbiochem Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (Merck) was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4Β°C and the supernatant was harvested. After adding NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), the samples were incubated at 70Β°C for 10 min and were run on NuPAGE 12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) [32]. Then, they were transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). After blocking with 10% nonfat milk, the blots were incubated with appropriately diluted plasma to be examined at 4Β°C overnight followed by incubation with Trueblot HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) (1β�¶1000) for 1 hr. The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System, GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions.Western Blot Analysis of AΞ² FibrilsFrontal cortex was subjected to analysis. Cortical tissue was homogenized in cold TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 M NaCl, pH7.5) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (SIGMA). After centrifugation at 100,000Γ—g for 1 h, the pellet was homogenized in TBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Then, the pellet was again homogenized in Guanidine buffer (5 M GuHCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was used for Western blotting. The blots were incubated with anti-AΞ² fibrils OC (Merk Millipore) (1β�¶1000) at 4Β°C overnight followed by incubation with Trueblot HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and chemiluminescence reagents. The image was obtained with an image analyzed (LAS-3000 mini, Fuji Film) and the densities of 56 kDa bands was quantitated using the Image J Software.Purification of Translated YM3711 Product (YM3711P) and Anti-YM3711P AntibodiesFor YM3711P purification, HEK293 cells were cultured and transfected with YM3711. After 4 days, culture supernatant was harvested and filtered. Since YM3711P contains the Fc portion of immunoglobulin, the product was further purified on a HiTrap Protein G column (GE Healthcare Japan). The eluate at O.D. 280 nm was harvested and strong AΞ² immunoreactivities were confirmed using anti-AΞ² mAb, 6E10.Anti-YM3711P antibodies were purified on a HiTrap Protein G column using 0.5 ml post-immune rabbit plasma. They were then biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin (Pierce).Binding and Competition Assays Using YM3711PYM3711P at concentrations of 2 Βµg/ml, 10 Βµg/ml and 20 Βµg/ml or AΞ²1-42 (2 Βµg/ml) were coated onto microtiter wells. After blocking, biotinylated IgG purified from plasma of rabbits that had been vaccinated with YM3711 were applied and followed by HRP-labeled VECTSTAIN Elite ABC Kit. Bound antibodies were detected using SIGMA FAST (Sigma-Aldrich) and the absorbance at 450 nm was read. Samples showing O.D. more than 2.5 were further diluted and reexamined. Calculated O.D. values are shown in the figure.For competition assay, YM3711P at a concentration of 2 Βµg/ml was applied onto microtiter wells. Then, wells were incubated with a mixture of biotinylated anti-YM3711P IgG and unlabeled various competitors at 0.1 to 100 ratios. Competitors included 6E10 (Covance Japan), 4G8 (Covance Japan), anti-AΞ²pE3-42 antibodies (Immuno-Biological Laboratories), anti-AΞ² oligomer antibodies (Life Technologies Japan) and unlabeled anti-YM3711P IgG. Then, the absorbance was read in the same way as the binding assay.Statistical AnalysisThe Studentβ€™s t test or Mann-Whitneyβ€™s U-test was used for the statistical analysis. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
