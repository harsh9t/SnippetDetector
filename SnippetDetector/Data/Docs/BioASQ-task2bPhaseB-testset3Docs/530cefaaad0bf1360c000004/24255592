Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by gradual cognitive decline associated with deterioration of daily living activities and behavioral disturbances throughout the course of the disease, is estimated to affect 27 million people around the world. It is expected that the illness will affect about 63 million people by 2030, and 114 million by 2050, worldwide. Current Alzheimer's disease medications may ease symptoms for a time but are not capable of slowing down disease progression. Indeed, all currently available therapies, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), are primarily considered symptomatic therapies, although recent data also suggest possible disease-modifying effects. Gantenerumab is an investigational fully human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and remove beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. This compound, currently undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials represents a promising agent with a disease-modifying potential in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present an overview of gantenerumab ranging from preclinical studies to human clinical trials.

Alzheimerβ€™s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It is estimated that AD affects 27 million people around the world, with the number of diagnosed cases expected to rise dramatically in the near future.1 AD is characterized by deficits in memory, language, executive functions, and other intellectual abilities that are serious enough to interfere with daily life. From a neuropathological point of view, the AD brain shows marked atrophy in the brain and the formation of two pathological lesions: extracellular amyloid plaques composed largely of amyloid-beta peptide (AΞ²) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.2 In recent years, however, growing evidence has supported the idea that disruption of connectivity within neural circuits, loss of synapses, and deteriorated synaptic function precedes the death of neurons. At this time, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have approved four drugs to treat the cognitive symptoms of AD; three are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an uncompetitive antagonist at glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Because reduction in the activity of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of AD, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may improve some cognitive aspects in patients with AD. However, prolonged use of these drugs has also proven effective in slowing down or halting disease progression. In fact, several evidences from preclinical studies indicate that these compounds might rescue neuronal damage and death from beta-amyloid (AΓ�)-induced toxicity, thus interfering with AD pathogenesis.3 The exact mechanisms by which these effects are achieved remain to be elucidated although several reports suggest neuroprotective,4,5 anti-inflammatory,6β€“8 and antioxidant roles.9,10 Nevertheless, AD still remains an unmet medical need for which therapies await new discoveries.

Targeting ² production and removal

At this time, the amyloid cascade hypothesis is the most important theory of AD, postulating that accumulation of AΞ² into plaques is the causative pathological event.11 On the basis of this hypothesis, interventions that reduce AΞ² load in the brain would be likely to attenuate both the neuropathological changes and functional deficits characterizing AD. Indeed several different AΞ²-lowering strategies have been developed during past years. Among these, AΞ² fibrillogenesis represents a major target for therapeutic intervention in AD and related human Ξ²-amyloidosis.12 Certain small-molecule inhibitors of synthetic AΞ² fibrillogenesis inhibit formation of cell-derived secreted oligomers of AΞ² and prevent the impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by AΞ².13,14 Importantly, this protective effect was achieved only under conditions in which the inhibitors prevented new oligomer formation.15 In fact, to be effective, inhibitors of fibrillogenesis need to be used at the initial stages of oligomerization, thus avoiding a paradoxical enhanced neurotoxicity that may derive from active prefibrillar assemblies such as low-n oligomers released after inhibition of fibril formation. For these reasons, a promising strategy consisted of preventing the formation of AΞ² by enhancing Ξ±-secretase activity or inhibiting either Ξ²-secretase or Ξ³-secretase activity. Among these, either Ξ³-secretase inhibitors or modulators represented the therapeutic approach with the highest expectations. However, recent clinical trials of Ξ³-secretase inhibitors and Ξ³-secretase modulators, including semagacestat, avagacestat, and R-flurbiprofen, have been discontinued for lack of efficacy and/or adverse effects, the mechanisms of which still remain unclear.16 An alternative approach consisted of the activation of enzymes or cells that degrade AΞ² or AΞ² aggregates, thus favoring AΞ² clearance.17,18 The protease activation strategy is theoretically attractive; however, a lack of specificity and the potential for toxicity confined this approach only to animal modeling studies.

Active versus passive immunotherapy
he therapeutic potential of clearing ² deposition by triggering a humoral immune response to fibrillar ²42 or passively administering anti-² antibodies has been the most extensively validated anti-² approach in preclinical studies. ither active or passive ² immunotherapy was developed to diminish the load of ² by promoting its removal.19 ctive immunization (vaccination) with either ²42 (the prevalent form of ² in the amyloid plaques of ) or other synthetic fragments has been successfully evaluated in transgenic mouse models of  and is generally based on the stimulation of -cell, -cell, and microglial immune responses. he results of the trials, initially promising, have been partially dashed by the appearance of meningoencephalitis in some patients.20 nother type of immunotherapy under investigation implicates passive administration with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies directed against ². his approach circumvents the need for the patient to mount an immunological response to the ² peptide. lthough both active and passive administration of anti-² antibodies seem to be effective in reducing -like pathology in preclinical models of , the mechanism by which they accomplish this effect, whether by stimulating microglial activity, preventing its aggregation or promoting its disaggregation, or a combination of these, still remains elusive.
f all ² immunotherapies, the furthest advanced in clinical development are the passive monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab21 and solanezumab.22 apineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the -terminus of ² (²1β€“5), whereas solanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind the central portion of ² (²12β€“28). f note, bapineuzumab, despite lowering key biomarkers of  such as amyloid brain plaque and phosphorylated tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, failed to produce significant cognitive improvements in two major clinical trials.23 n addition, the hase  results for solanezumab were only mildly encouraging (li illy and o, ndianapolis, , ; xpedition studies 1 and 2), so the development of this compound for the treatment of -related dementia will continue with a confirmatory clinical trial to be launched later in 2013 (see the ecember 12, 2012, press release on the illy website).24
ther monoclonal antibodies against ² developed so far include -04360365 (ponezumab), which targets the free -terminus of ², and specifically ²34β€“41; 5102, which binds to ² monomers, oligomers, and fibrils with equally high affinity; 933776, which, similar to bapineuzumab, targets the -terminal sequence of ²; 2401, which targets ² protofibrils; and gantenerumab, which targets the -terminus and central portion of ².Active versus passive immunotherapy
The therapeutic potential of clearing AΞ² deposition by triggering a humoral immune response to fibrillar AΞ²42 or passively administering anti-AΞ² antibodies has been the most extensively validated anti-AΞ² approach in preclinical studies. Either active or passive AΞ² immunotherapy was developed to diminish the load of AΞ² by promoting its removal.19 Active immunization (vaccination) with either AΞ²42 (the prevalent form of AΞ² in the amyloid plaques of AD) or other synthetic fragments has been successfully evaluated in transgenic mouse models of AD and is generally based on the stimulation of T-cell, B-cell, and microglial immune responses. The results of the trials, initially promising, have been partially dashed by the appearance of meningoencephalitis in some patients.20 Another type of immunotherapy under investigation implicates passive administration with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies directed against AΞ². This approach circumvents the need for the patient to mount an immunological response to the AΞ² peptide. Although both active and passive administration of anti-AΞ² antibodies seem to be effective in reducing AD-like pathology in preclinical models of AD, the mechanism by which they accomplish this effect, whether by stimulating microglial activity, preventing its aggregation or promoting its disaggregation, or a combination of these, still remains elusive.
Of all AΞ² immunotherapies, the furthest advanced in clinical development are the passive monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab21 and solanezumab.22 Bapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the N-terminus of AΞ² (AΞ²1β€“5), whereas solanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind the central portion of AΞ² (AΞ²12β€“28). Of note, bapineuzumab, despite lowering key biomarkers of AD such as amyloid brain plaque and phosphorylated tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, failed to produce significant cognitive improvements in two major clinical trials.23 In addition, the Phase III results for solanezumab were only mildly encouraging (Eli Lilly and Co, Indianapolis, IN, USA; Expedition studies 1 and 2), so the development of this compound for the treatment of AD-related dementia will continue with a confirmatory clinical trial to be launched later in 2013 (see the December 12, 2012, press release on the Lilly website).24
Other monoclonal antibodies against AΞ² developed so far include PF-04360365 (ponezumab), which targets the free C-terminus of AΞ², and specifically AΞ²34β€“41; MABT5102A, which binds to AΞ² monomers, oligomers, and fibrils with equally high affinity; GSK933776A, which, similar to bapineuzumab, targets the N-terminal sequence of AΞ²; BAN2401, which targets AΞ² protofibrils; and gantenerumab, which targets the N-terminus and central portion of AΞ².

Gantenerumab: preclinical studies
antenerumab is a monoclonal immunoglobulin (g)1 antibody selected from a synthetic human combinatorial antibody library (u. CALΒ®; MorphoSys, Martinsried/Planegg, Germany) based on phage display technology and was optimized by in vitro affinity maturation. Different from bapineuzumab and solanezumab, which are humanized versions of murine antibodies, gantenerumab is the first entirely human anti-AΞ² monoclonal antibody to enter clinical development.
PharmacodynamicsMost of the preclinical data available so far are included in a recently published study.25 Gantenerumab passes the bloodβ€“brain barrier and has a high binding affinity to cerebral amyloid plaques. The proposed binding mode of gantenerumab to fibrillar AΞ² involves both N-terminal and spatially adjacent central AΞ² sequences. According to this model, the flexible N-terminals of AΞ² are the initial contact points of gantenerumab binding, followed by interaction with adjacent central AΞ², part of which confers increased binding stability. The specificity of gantenerumab predicts strong binding to native AΞ² plaques. Indeed, in brain sections from AD patients and PS2APP transgenic mice, highly efficient immunostaining of fibrillar AΞ² was observed at low picomolar concentrations. Equilibrium binding studies, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, indicated dissociation constant (KD) values of 0.6, 1.2, and 17 nM for AΞ² fibrils, AΞ² oligomers, and AΞ² monomers, respectively. Accordingly, long-term treatment with gantenerumab in vivo was associated with a reduction of the amyloid plaque load in PS2APP mice. Notably, no indication for antidrug antibodies was observed during the 5 months of treatment.One mechanism by which anti-AΞ² antibodies might exert their effects is via brain-resident microglial activation. Accordingly, systemic administration of an anti-AΞ² antibody binding aggregated AΞ² was associated with a marked increase in the number of microglial cells in transgenic AD mice, thus providing insights into the putative mechanism of action of passive immunotherapy for AD.26 Similarly, microglia cells and microglia ramifications were spotted in proximity of plaques that reacted with gantenerumab, suggesting a microglia-mediated phagocytic plaque clearance mechanism. Moreover, when cultured with primary human macrophages in vitro, gantenerumab induced cellular phagocytosis of AΞ² in human brain tissue. Nevertheless, a possible direct disaggregation of plaques without glial involvement cannot be ruled out. Unlike other AΞ² antibodies, gantenerumab interacted only with aggregated AΞ² in the brain, without interfering with plasma AΞ², indicating that the normal degradation pathway of circulating AΞ² is not affected. Moreover, gantenerumab neither triggered reactive inflammation on degradation of brain plaques nor worsened the occurrence of cerebral AΞ² angiopathy or microhemorrhages.PharmacokineticsSimilar linear pharmacokinetics profiles of gantenerumab were obtained in both wild-type and transgenic models of AD.25 Accordingly, in both wild-type and PS2APP mice, gantenerumab exhibited a biphasic appearance with approximately dose-proportional increases in maximum concentration (Cmax) and area-under-the-curve parameters. Moreover, gantenerumab was eliminated slowly in transgenic or wild-type mice. To establish the kinetic profile of gantenerumab binding in vivo in the PS2APP model of AD, its reactivity with AΞ² plaques was measured for up to 9 weeks. The maximal binding of gantenerumab to AΞ² plaques was generally observed at different doses after 2β€“3 weeks in all brain regions with plaques (ie, cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus). The binding of gantenerumab to AΞ² plaques was still measurable for more than 2 months, as shown for plaques in the frontal cortex, whereas the half-life of gantenerumab in plasma was 6.5 days and was no longer detectable after 3 weeks.25Functional studiesDuring the last few years, transgenic models have offered the advantage of examining the bases for the spatial/temporal evolution of the disease. In addition, the combination of electrophysiological and behavioral techniques has been a very powerful tool not only to address important questions about the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease but also to test the functional outcome of novel ligands27,28 and assess the efficacy of therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.29 LTP, which represents a widely accepted model of learning and memory at the cellular level, is typically altered after manipulation of specific plasticity-related genes30β€“33 and is impaired in several animal models of human neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsonβ€™s disease,34 depression,35 autism spectrum disorders,36 and multiple sclerosis.37 Most currently studied AD models show cognitive deficits and age-related disruption of synaptic markers and amyloid plaque deposition, but few strains show evidence of significant cell death. Most studies have reported, principally, either inhibition of LTP or reduction in baseline fast excitatory transmission before plaque deposition.38,39Interventions that reduce AΞ² load in the brain would be likely to attenuate both the neuropathological changes and functional deficits characterizing AD. Indeed, lowering the production of the peptide by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for AΞ² generation, preventing the formation of AΞ² aggregates, and increasing the rate of AΞ² clearance from the brain have all proven successful in experimental models of AD.11 Accordingly, preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of AΞ² plaque and preservation of LTP and behavioral deficit in different transgenic AΞ²PP models.40,41 Notably, 3D6 was shown to bind to soluble, synaptotoxic assemblies of AΞ², thus preventing AΞ² downstream effects. In addition, acute and subchronic treatment with solanezumab was able to attenuate memory deficits in platelet-derived growth factor promoter expressing amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice,42 having lesser hemorrhagic potential than bapineuzumab. Along these lines, the ability of gantenerumab to react not only with the AΞ² fibrils and plaques but also with oligomeric AΞ² might suggest its potential in restoring synaptic deficits associated with AD models. Indeed, in vivo measurements in adult male Sprague Dawley rats showed that gantenerumab attenuated the inhibition of LTP caused by intracerebroventricular injection of soluble AΞ²42 aggregates. The effects of gantenerumab on cognitive assessment in the Morris water maze test were inconclusive, as both wild-type and transgenic AD mice injected with vehicle displayed impairment of learning, which might be ascribed to stress conditions caused by weekly intracerebroventricular injections. Importantly, neurological or motor impairments were not detected even after 5 months of treatment.24
