3-Iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) is an endogenous compound with chemical features that are similar to thyroid hormone. T(1)AM has a carbon skeleton identical to that of T(4) and contains a single carbon-iodine bond. Theoretically, T(1)AM could be produced from T(4) by enzymatic decarboxylation and deiodination. Recent studies show that T(1)AM and higher iodinated thyronamines are subject to similar metabolic processing as iodothyronines such as T(4), suggesting a biological linkage between iodothyronines and iodothyronamines. In addition, single doses of T(1)AM administered to rodents induce a hypometabolic state that in certain ways resembles hibernation and is opposite to the effects of excess T(4). This review will discuss the latest developments on this recently discovered thyroid hormone derivative.
