<abstract>
The pathophysiology of brain damage that is common to ischemia-reperfusion injury and brain trauma include disodered neuronal and glial cell energetics, intracellular acidosis, calcium toxicity, extracellular excitotoxic glutamate accumulation, and dysfunction of the cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum. The principal thyroid hormones, 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3)) and l-thyroxine (T(4)), have non-genomic and genomic actions that are relevant to repair of certain features of the pathophysiology of brain damage. The hormone can non-genomically repair intracellular H(+) accumulation by stimulation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger and can support desirably low [Ca(2+)](i.c.) by activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase. Thyroid hormone non-genomically stimulates astrocyte glutamate uptake, an action that protects both glial cells and neurons. The hormone supports the integrity of the microfilament cytoskeleton by its effect on actin. Several proteins linked to thyroid hormone action are also neuroprotective. For example, the hormone stimulates expression of the seladin-1 gene whose gene product is anti-apoptotic and is potentially protective in the setting of neurodegeneration. Transthyretin (TTR) is a serum transport protein for T(4) that is important to blood-brain barrier transfer of the hormone and TTR also has been found to be neuroprotective in the setting of ischemia. Finally, the interesting thyronamine derivatives of T(4) have been shown to protect against ischemic brain damage through their ability to induce hypothermia in the intact organism. Thus, thyroid hormone or hormone derivatives have experimental promise as neuroprotective agents.

Introduction
he critical contributions of thyroid hormone to development of the nervous system (arwell et al., 2006; ernal, 2007), to mature and immature brain glial cell (iegrist-aiser et al., 1990; arwell et al., 1995, 2006), and neuronal function (onkers and ibera, 2008; hou et al., 2011) and to behavior (avis et al., 2010) are well-known. hile hypothyroidism has been reported by some observers to be neuroprotective in the setting of ischemia (huaib et al., 1994a; levizaki et al., 2006), repeated administration of l-thyroxine (4) has also been shown to protect against brain ischemia (ami and rieglstein, 1992) and thyroid hormone is known to support the integrity of brain vasculature (chlenker et al., 2008). odothyronines may support by non-genomic or genomic molecular mechanisms support the activities of plasma membrane ion pumps or channels that are important to normal excitable cell function. hese pumps that are stimulated by 3, 5, 3β€²-triiodo-l-thyronine (3) or, in some cases, by 4 include the a+/+ exchanger (ncerpi et al., 1998), a, -ase (ei et al., 2004, 2006), and a2+-ases (avis et al., 1983a,b; ylotte et al., 1985) and the channels include the inward rectifier + channel (akaguchi et al., 1996) and the a+ current (onkers and ibera, 2008; hou et al., 2011).  contribution to normalizing intracellular p. H in the setting of excess H+ accumulation (Incerpi et al., 1998) that occurs with ischemia/acidosis is obviously a desirable action of the hormone, as would be stimulation of Na, K-ATPase that would maintain normal [Na+]i.c. in the face of enhanced proton-for-Na+ exchange. Thyroid hormone can also increase glial cell glutamate uptake (Mendes-de-Aguiar et al., 2008), thus protecting neurons and astrocytes against the toxicity of glutamate at the cell surface.
In this review, we will briefly describe the molecular basis for several actions of thyroid hormone analogs that can now be interpreted as neuroprotective. Most of these actions are non-genomic in mechanism, that is, they do not rely primarily on the interaction of T3 with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TR proteins) and consequent specific gene transcription (Cheng et al., 2010). The hormones are T3, T4, and the thyronamines (Piehl et al., 2011). We will also comment on the apparently neuroprotective action of a serum thyroid hormone transport protein, transthyretin (TTR; Santos et al., 2010).

Glutamate eurotoxicity and hyroid ormone
ncreases in extraneuronal glutamate neurotransmitter concentration stimulate nerve cell glutamate receptors and can result in excitotoxicity and neuronal death (anbolt, 2001; endes-de-guiar et al., 2008). ia several high affinity glutamate-specific transporters, astrocytes take up glutamate from the extracellular matrix environment and are a defense against neuronal excitotoxicity. ithin the cell, glutamate supports several metabolic cascades, including energy production and antioxidant (glutathione) functions. he brain damage that results from ischemia is mediated to an important degree by excessive glutamate release from neurons and glial cells (see review by ongin, 2007), resulting in excessive depolarization and accumulation of cytoplasmic a2+. n addition to glutamate and calcium toxicity, other factors contributing to neuronal damage and death in ischemia include free radical and nitric oxide accumulations and dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (uo et al., 2009).
gainst this background, studies by endes-de-guiar et al. (2008) reported that 3 at 10β�’8  eliminated the β€�gliotoxicβ€� effect of glutamate on cultured cerebellar astrocytes from newborn rats and ensured viability of astrocytes and of neurons co-cultured with the astrocytes. he mechanism involved in these observations included increased astrocyte uptake of glutamate that was attributable to increased cellular abundance of -1 and  m. RNAs and protein. GLT-1 and GLAST are the principal plasma membrane glutamate transporters of astrocytes. Losi et al. (2008) showed that T3 protected rat hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity by a non-genomic mechanism). Thus, the defense against glutamate toxicity in neurons and glial cells that is imposed by T3 may be both genomic and non-genomic in mechanism. The existence of seamless interfaces between thyroid hormone-initiated non-genomic and genomic actions has recently been appreciated (Lin et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2010; Davis et al., 2011).
Given the contributions of excessive glutamate accumulation extraneuronally to ischemic brain injury, brain concussive injury (Yi and Hazell, 2006; Jennings et al., 2008), heavy metal toxicity (Struzyriska, 2009), and a variety of other brain damage syndromes, there is a rationale for investigating the feasibility of modulating glutamate toxicity with thyroid hormone analogs. Depending upon the pathological setting and model, the scheduling of hormone administration may be acute or subacute. It may be useful to quantitate the proportion of the hormonal effect in models that is non-genomic in initiation and thus subject to management with T3 that has been reformulated to act at the cell surface (Lin et al., 2011).

Hypothyroidism and europrotection; hyroid ormone dministration and europrotection
ecause both hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone administration have been reported to be protective in the setting of brain ischemia, it is important to specify the experimental conditions under which these actions have been described. xperimental hypothyroidism (huaib et al., 1994a; astogi et al., 2006) and subclinical hypothyroidism (levizaki et al., 2006; khoundi et al., 2011) may result in apparently improved neurological outcomes from brain ischemia, that is, preservation of function. he experimental hypothyroidism observations have been collected in several animal models of transient cerebral ischemia in which the state of established hypothyroidism has either reduced neuronal death (huaib et al., 1994a; astogi et al., 2006) or has delayed, but did not prevent, neuronal death (ee et al., 2010). he rationales for an apparently protective effect of thyroid hypofunction established prior to neurological insult include decreased metabolic demands of nerve cells, decreased oxidative stress (astogi et al., 2006), decreased excitatory glutamate production (huaib et al., 1994b), and, possibly, decreased body temperature. ecreased glutamate production per se can be viewed as neuroprotective in the sense of attenuated excitotoxicity (see below), however, it may not be desirable when it impairs antioxidant glutathione production (endes-de-guiar et al., 2008). t is presently impractical clinically to induce hypothyroidism acutely, although, as will be described below, the thyronamine thyroid hormone analogs can induce hypothermia quickly and neuroprotection may be afforded by this measure.
eduction of hippocampal neuronal damage from ischemia with repeated daily 4 administration was shown in the rat 20β€‰years ago by ami and rieglstein (1992), with approximately a 50% increase in neuronal density attributable to hormone treatment. ubsequently, it was shown that experimental hyperthyroidism that is established before focal ischemia may increase neuronal insult in the rat (astogi et al., 2008). hus, any neuronal rescue that may occur with thyroid hormone administration must avoid induction of hypermetabolism. he molecular basis for an acute effect of thyroid hormone isoforms on post-ischemic neuronal survival may involve on genomic actions of the hormone on intracellular p. H, Na+, and Ca2+, as suggested above. T3 has been shown to stimulate Na+/H+ (NHE1) exchanger/transporter activity in excitable cells and to enhance recovery of intracellular pH after an acid load (Incerpi et al., 1998). The mechanism of increased exchanger activity includes thyroid hormone-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; Dβ€™Arezzo et al., 2004). The ischemic neuron has accumulated H+ and thus enhanced exchanger pump activity is desirable from the standpoint of pH. The theoretical price that is paid for increased Na+/H+ activity is the import of Na+, the consequent possibility of reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NSCE) and an undesirable increase in [Ca2+]i.c.. However, T3 also stimulates Na, K-ATPase activity (Lei et al., 2004, 2006), and increases the number of pump subunits inserted in the plasma membrane. This effect acts to reduce [Na+]i.c.. Finally, a number of studies have shown iodothyronines activate Ca2+-ATPase activity (Davis et al., 1983a; Mylotte et al., 1985) by a calmodulin-dependent mechanism (Davis et al., 1983b); this non-genomic effect contributes to modulation of any increase in intracellular Ca2+ that may occur.
Given that iodothyronines can increase certain membrane ion pump activities, it seems paradoxical that overall neuronal excitability β€“ spike number and action potentials β€“ might be decreased by the hormone. We have already described the inhibitory effect of T3 on glutamate excitotoxicity that affects neurons and appears to be mediated by glial cells. In addition, Cao et al. (2011) have recently reported a non-genomic effect of T4 to decrease the excitability of pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex slices. While this is potentially an energy-conserving mechanism at a time of hypoxic stress, the observation requires confirmation and studies of mechanism, since thyroid hormone is known increase certain membrane ion currents (Sakaguchi et al., 1996; Yonkers and Ribera, 2008; Zhou et al., 2011).
In summary, the decreased metabolic demands of the hypothyroid brain may reduce the impact of ischemia. However, acute imposition of hypothyroidism in the clinical context of CNS ischemia is impractical. Protection of intraneuronal or glial pH, and [Ca2+]i.c. and suppression of glutamate neuroexcitation (see below) with a short-term, non-hyperthyroid increase in iodothyronines appears to deserve further experimental evaluation in euthyroid animal models of ischemia/stroke. Certain of the neuroprotective actions of thyroid hormone are depicted in Figure 1.
Figure 1Selected mechanisms at the plasma membrane by which thyroid hormone may non-genomically or genomically have protective effects on neurons and glial cells in the setting of acute brain ischemia. In response to thyroid hormone (T3), astrocytes and neurons may take up glutamate from the extracellular apace via increased activity of specific transporters (GLAST and GLT-1), reducing neuroexcitation fostered by glutamate at the neuronal surface. The hormone may also increase the number of glutamate transporters in the plasma membrane. Thyroid hormone (T3) increases activity of the Na/H exchanger, reducing the intracellular acid load that results from ischemia. Sodium pump (Na, K-ATPase) activity is enhanced by T3 and there is increased expression of the Na, K-ATPase gene in response to iodothyronines. Export of Na+ by the pump is relevant because of the increased activity of the Na/H exchanger results in import of Na+. An increase in [Na+]i.c. results in an undesirable increase in cell uptake of Ca2+ by sodiumβ€“calcium exchange (not shown in the figure). Enhanced activity of the calcium pump (Ca2+-ATPase) caused by thyroid hormone (T4 and T3) also protects against intracellular accumulation of Ca2+. ECM, extracellular matrix.

Seladin-1 and myloid-² rotein recursor and hyroid ormone
he ective  ndicator-1 (seladin-1) gene codes for a novel protective factor that has been seen to be deficient in lzheimerβ€™s disease (; reeve et al., 2000; eri and erio, 2008). mong several effects, the protein inhibits pro-apoptotic caspase 3. he seladin-1 protein also has enzymatic activity as a hydroxysterol reductase that converts desmosterol to cholesterol. hyroid hormone, particularly 3, promotes the expression of seladin-1 in neuronal precursor cells, such as human mesenchymal stem cells and fetal neuroepithelial cells (envenuti et al., 2008). hus, the actions of thyroid hormone on the seladin-1 axis are relevant to brain cell development/differentiation and appear to protect neuron precursor cells from programmed cell death. he critical contributions of thyroid hormone to embryonic-fetal brain development are very well-recognized and now may include contributions from seladin-1 gene expression. he optimistic possibility may also exist that seladin-1 is a factor that supports a pool of multipotent  cells beyond the period of brain development and that might be accessed in the settings of certain brain disorders.
n addition to stimulating expression of seladin-1, 3 is known to suppress expression of the ²-amyloid precursor protein () gene in neuroblastoma cells in vitro (elandia et al., 1998). he hormone had been reported earlier by the same group to have complex and variable effects on  gene splicing (atasa et al., 1998). an and asan (2009) have recently reviewed a substantial literature on thyroid function in the setting of  and have speculated that suboptimal iodothyronine concentrations in the  may support ² accumulation and the products thereof, t is not clear whether the amyloid-²-peptide and amyloid-²-protein are etiologic or secondary factors in a complex pattern of pathogenesis in . owever, the possibility that thyroid hormone has a neuroprotective effect in the context of neurodegeneration would appear to warrant additional experimental consideration.

(2006)) and accelerate vascular deposition of ² protein (ati et al., 2009). his controversy requires resolution.Seladin-1 and Amyloid-Ξ² Protein Precursor and Thyroid Hormone
The SELective AD Indicator-1 (seladin-1) gene codes for a novel protective factor that has been seen to be deficient in Alzheimerβ€™s disease (AD; Greeve et al., 2000; Peri and Serio, 2008). Among several effects, the protein inhibits pro-apoptotic caspase 3. The seladin-1 protein also has enzymatic activity as a hydroxysterol reductase that converts desmosterol to cholesterol. Thyroid hormone, particularly T3, promotes the expression of seladin-1 in neuronal precursor cells, such as human mesenchymal stem cells and fetal neuroepithelial cells (Benvenuti et al., 2008). Thus, the actions of thyroid hormone on the seladin-1 axis are relevant to brain cell development/differentiation and appear to protect neuron precursor cells from programmed cell death. The critical contributions of thyroid hormone to embryonic-fetal brain development are very well-recognized and now may include contributions from seladin-1 gene expression. The optimistic possibility may also exist that seladin-1 is a factor that supports a pool of multipotent CNS cells beyond the period of brain development and that might be accessed in the settings of certain brain disorders.
In addition to stimulating expression of seladin-1, T3 is known to suppress expression of the Ξ²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene in neuroblastoma cells in vitro (Belandia et al., 1998). The hormone had been reported earlier by the same group to have complex and variable effects on APP gene splicing (Latasa et al., 1998). Tan and Vasan (2009) have recently reviewed a substantial literature on thyroid function in the setting of AD and have speculated that suboptimal iodothyronine concentrations in the CNS may support AΞ²PP accumulation and the products thereof, It is not clear whether the amyloid-Ξ²-peptide and amyloid-Ξ²-protein are etiologic or secondary factors in a complex pattern of pathogenesis in AD. However, the possibility that thyroid hormone has a neuroprotective effect in the context of neurodegeneration would appear to warrant additional experimental consideration.
Such a consideration also raises the issue of transport of thyroid hormone isoforms from blood into brain tissue. At least in part, such intercompartmental transport involves TTR, a serum transport protein for T4 and for tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac); TTR is discussed below as a possible neuroprotective factor in ischemia. In addition, and emphasizing the complexity of the relationship of TTR to neuroprotection and neurodegenertation, TTR has been reported to have apparently contradictory actions in the mouse model of AD, in that it may enhance cleavage of the AΞ²-peptide (Costa et al. (2006)) and accelerate vascular deposition of AΞ² protein (Wati et al., 2009). This controversy requires resolution.

Transthyretin in rain schemia
ransthyretin, is a blood and  protein that contributes to maintaining intravascular pools of 4 and of retinol. s noted above,  is also responsible for facilitating access of thyroid hormone to brain.  is secreted by the liver and by choroid plexus. t is involved in amyloid deposition. ecause brain  gene expression is increased in response to injury/ischemia, antos et al. (2010) recently searched for a possible contribution of  to neuroprotection. he investigators were surprised to find that the brain of the  null mouse did not exhibit increased vulnerability to ischemic damage. owever, when a mouse heterozygous for heat-shock transcription factor 1 (1) β€“ and thus exhibiting a somewhat impaired stress response was rendered β�’/β�’, middle cerebral artery occlusion induced a profoundly severe injury in terms of volume of brain cortex infarct, cerebral edema, and white blood cell immigration. he increase in severity of damage was expressed relative to that in the +/+ 1+/β�’ control animals. nterestingly, , itself, was distributed throughout the area of infarction in the β�’/β�’ 1+/β�’ mouse brain. hus,  can be neuroprotective, but this is apparent only when a second stress or defense factor is impaired and such is the case in the 1+/β�’ mouse brain in the setting of ischemia. n these studies, it was -source  that was important to neuroprotection, since inhibition by i of liver  production did not affect the model.
he results emphasize that there may be redundancy in neuroprotective responses that are based on proteins such as  and 1 and this has implications for experimental design. he study does not provide insight into possible contributions of thyroid hormone-binding or retinol-binding (or retinol-binding globulin) to the behavior of  in the neuroprotective response. his issue is of some relevance, given the preceding discussion of neuroprotective actions of thyroid hormone isoforms, themselves, on local accumulations of glutamate or on intracellular p. H of glial cells or neurons.

Thyronamines, ypothermia, and europrotection
hyronamines are thyroid hormone derivatives whose side chain has been decarboxylated. wo thyronamines β€“ the completely deiodinated product (0) and a derivative that retains the 3-iodine (1) β€“ have been exploited for several experimental purposes by canlan and colleagues (iehl et al., 2011) and are of particular interest with regard to brain protection. he compounds occur naturally in small quantities and are ligands for a  protein-coupled receptor (1), rather than for s. ne of their remarkable effects is that of lowering body temperature without inducing homeostatic responses. ecause of the known protective effect of hypothermia on brain damage associated with ischemia, the thyronamines have been tested by oyle et al. (2007) against stroke injury. dministered intraperitoneally 1β€‰h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the agents promptly lowered mouse body temperature to 31° from 37°. he thyronamines significantly reduced brain infarct volume at 24β€‰h by about 33%. he specificity of the neuroprotective impact of hormone analog-induced hypothermia was shown by prevention of the neuronal salvage by maintaining animal body temperature at 37° during administration of thyronamines. he induction of hypothermia by the thyronamines is presumed to be mediated by the 1 receptor and the nerve cell salvage is thought to reflect decreased metabolic rate and lowered free radical generation.
he apparent effectiveness of the agents in ischemia-induced brain injury does not exclude consideration of the thyronamines for application to other models of  injury, for example, concussive trauma and global anoxic damage at the time of cardiac arrest. t is clear that systemic administration of the thyronamines permits their trespass of the bloodβ€“brain barrier, but it is not known by what precise mechanism the barrier is crossed. he thyronamines do not appear to gain access to the interior of cells by the principal thyroid hormone uptake system, monocarboyxlate transporter 8 (8; inne et al., 2010).Thyronamines, Hypothermia, and Neuroprotection
Thyronamines are thyroid hormone derivatives whose side chain has been decarboxylated. Two thyronamines β€“ the completely deiodinated product (T0AM) and a derivative that retains the 3-iodine (T1AM) β€“ have been exploited for several experimental purposes by Scanlan and colleagues (Piehl et al., 2011) and are of particular interest with regard to brain protection. The compounds occur naturally in small quantities and are ligands for a G protein-coupled receptor (TAAR1), rather than for TRs. One of their remarkable effects is that of lowering body temperature without inducing homeostatic responses. Because of the known protective effect of hypothermia on brain damage associated with ischemia, the thyronamines have been tested by Doyle et al. (2007) against stroke injury. Administered intraperitoneally 1β€‰h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the agents promptly lowered mouse body temperature to 31Β°C from 37Β°C. The thyronamines significantly reduced brain infarct volume at 24β€‰h by about 33%. The specificity of the neuroprotective impact of hormone analog-induced hypothermia was shown by prevention of the neuronal salvage by maintaining animal body temperature at 37Β°C during administration of thyronamines. The induction of hypothermia by the thyronamines is presumed to be mediated by the TAAR1 receptor and the nerve cell salvage is thought to reflect decreased metabolic rate and lowered free radical generation.
The apparent effectiveness of the agents in ischemia-induced brain injury does not exclude consideration of the thyronamines for application to other models of CNS injury, for example, concussive trauma and global anoxic damage at the time of cardiac arrest. It is clear that systemic administration of the thyronamines permits their trespass of the bloodβ€“brain barrier, but it is not known by what precise mechanism the barrier is crossed. The thyronamines do not appear to gain access to the interior of cells by the principal thyroid hormone uptake system, monocarboyxlate transporter 8 (MCT8; Kinne et al., 2010).

Possibly rotective ffects of 4 on lial ell ytoskeleton and ntracellular rotein rafficking
hyroid hormone, notably 4, has important actions on the actin cytoskeleton that were first described in glial cells in 1990 (iegrist-aiser et al., 1990). nterestingly, reverse 3, but not 3, also stabilizes the cytoskeleton (arwell et al., 2006). nder the direction of thyroid hormone, soluble actin is converted to -actin in a variety of cells, a function that stabilizes microfilaments, enabling cell motility, and the interaction of cells with extracellular proteins. he latter include laminins that support adhesion to the basal lamina (basement membrane) and growth factors that are neuroprotective, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (b. FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF; Hicks et al., 1998). Dissolution of the cytoskeleton is one phase of ischemic neuronal cell death (Lipton, 1999) and thus, thyroid hormone may be a factor that desirably stabilizes cell and tissue structure in the face of ischemic challenge to structure. Iodothyronines have been shown to enhance activities of EGF (Lin et al., 1999) and bFGF (Davis et al., 2004).
The cytoskeleton is also important to cell protein trafficking, a process whose maintenance is imperative in response to ischemia/hypoxia. Thyroid hormone has very substantial effects on the intracellular trafficking of kinases, nuclear hormone receptors (cytoplasm-to-nucleus), and a variety of transactivators (Cao et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2011). The energetics of the hypoxic cell may be impaired and this may limit the activation of MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by iodothyronines (Lin et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2011) that is critical to trafficking.

(2010) and avis et al. (2011). hat thyroid hormone may be neuroprotective has been explored in this review. hat is attractive about the apparently neuroprotective effect of 3 and 4 is that they coherently affect multiple defense mechanisms that can be invoked in brain damage settings. he possibility has also been discussed that thyroid hormone-relevant proteins such as  may be defensive in the setting of ischemia/reperfusion injury. inally, the concept that thyroid hormone analogs such as the thyronamines are relevant to neuroprotection should encourage exploration of additional forms of the hormone for desirable effects on the nervous system at risk for injury.Conclusion
