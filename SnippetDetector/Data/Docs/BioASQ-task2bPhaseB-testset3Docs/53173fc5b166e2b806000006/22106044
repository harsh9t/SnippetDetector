<abstract>
Timothy syndrome (TS) is an autosomal dominant condition with the constellation of features including prolonged QT interval, hand and foot abnormalities, and mental retardation or autism. Splawski et al. [2004] previously described two phenotypes associated with TS distinguished by two unique and different mutations within the CACNA1C gene. We report on a newborn who presented with prolonged QT interval and associated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, dysmorphic facial features, syndactyly of the hands and feet, and joint contractures, suggestive of TS. He developed a stroke, subsequent intractable seizures, and was found to have cortical blindness and later profound developmental delay. Initial targeted mutation analysis did not identify either of the previously described TS associated mutations; however, full gene sequencing detected a novel CACNA1C gene mutation (p.Ala1473Gly). The clinical and genetic findings in our case expand both the clinical and molecular knowledge of TS.
