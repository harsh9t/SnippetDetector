Heart failure is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. It has been shown that inflammatory markers may play a role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Therefore, inflammatory markers and anticytokine therapy in heart failure have become the attractive subjects in the literature. There are new studies regarding this issue in the literature.
