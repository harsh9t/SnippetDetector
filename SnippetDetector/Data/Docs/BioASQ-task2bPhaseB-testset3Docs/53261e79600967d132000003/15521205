Effects of thyroid gland hormones on cardiovascular system have been known for many years. Thyroid gland hormones deficiency is connected with a range of metabolic and hemodynamic changes which can contribute to a genesis of heart failure. Recent works refer to an importance of connection of thyroid gland hormones metabolism with heart insufficiency pathophysiology. That is especially a syndrome of a low trijodthyronin level marked as euthyroid sick syndrome which is significantly more frequent in patients with chronic heart failure compared to a population of healthy individuals. Recent clinical works proved that treatment administration of thyroid gland hormones to patients with heart failure is connected with favourable hemodynamic changes and increased working capacity if the treatment is well tolerated.
