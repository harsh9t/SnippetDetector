Protein Inhibitor of Activated Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription 3 (PIAS3) is a molecule that regulates STAT3 and has antiproliferative properties. Glioblastoma and squamous cell lung cancer lack PIAS3 expression. To test the hypothesis that PIAS3 transcriptional effects are STAT3-independent, we developed models for STAT3 knockdown and PIAS3 over-expression. PIAS3 expression results in a distinct transcriptional profile that does not occur with STAT3 knockdown. We identify novel transcription factor binding partners for PIAS3 including ETS, EGR1, NR1I2, and GATA1. PIAS3 binds to these factors and regulates their transcriptional effects resulting in alterations in canonical pathways including Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and functions such as cell death and proliferation. A model is proposed by which PIAS3 effects EGR1 regulated pathways.
