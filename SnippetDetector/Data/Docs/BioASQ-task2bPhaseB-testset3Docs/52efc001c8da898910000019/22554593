OBJECTIVE: To identify the effect of a controlled metabolic diet on reducing urinary calcium oxalate (CaOx) supersaturation in subjects with hyperoxaluric nephrolithiasis after potentially malabsorptive forms of bariatric surgery. METHODS: Subjects with a history of CaOx kidney stones and mild hyperoxaluria after bariatric surgery (n = 9) collected baseline 24-hour urine samples while consuming a free choice diet. They were then instructed to consume a controlled diet low in oxalate (70-80 mg/d), normal in calcium (1000 mg/d), and moderate in protein before 2 final 24-hour urine collections. RESULTS: Overall, the urinary CaOx supersaturation decreased from 1.97 ± 0.49 delta Gibbs (DG) with the free choice diet to 1.13 ± 0.75 DG with the controlled diet (P < .01). This occurred in the absence of a significant change in urinary oxalate excretion (0.69 ± 0.29 mmol/d with the free choice diet compared with 0.66 ± 0.38 mmol/d with the controlled diet). Urinary volume, citrate, and pH all increased, although not significantly (P > .05), contributing to the significant CaOx supersaturation change. CONCLUSION: A controlled metabolic diet normal in calcium, moderate in protein, and reduced in oxalate can positively affect urinary CaOx supersaturation after bariatric surgery. However, this diet did not appear to decrease urinary oxalate excretion. Therefore, restriction of dietary oxalate alone might not be enough to reduce urinary oxalate excretion to normal levels in this group of patients with known enteric hyperoxaluria. Additional strategies could be necessary, such as the use of oral calcium supplements as oxalate binders and a lower fat diet.
