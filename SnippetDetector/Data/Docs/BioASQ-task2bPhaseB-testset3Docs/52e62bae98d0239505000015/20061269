People with higher fitness and higher aerobic capacity have longer life expectancies compared to inactive people. Longer and better life can result from some genetic factors, as well as from higher physical capacities acquired during younger years. However, there are several studies proving the definitive role of life-long physical activity, too, which can be engaged in at any age. Even at very old ages, regular physical activity results in a lot of benefits, in high quality of life, in independence and longevity.
