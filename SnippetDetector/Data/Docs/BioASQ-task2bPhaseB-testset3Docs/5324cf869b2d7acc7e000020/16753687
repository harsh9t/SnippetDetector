The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of different doses of a compound containing isoflavones 60 mg, primrose oil 440 mg and vitamin E 10 mg. (IOVE) on menopausal complaints. This was an open, multicentre, randomised, group comparative, efficacy and safety trial. A total of 1,080 postmenopausal women, with climacteric symptoms, were allocated into one of two treatment groups to receive one (Group 1; n = 562) or two IOVE capsules (Group 2; n = 518) per day. The Blatt - Kupperman scale and safety parameters including weight, body mass index, blood pressure and adverse effects were assessed at the first visit before initiating the treatment, and 3 - 6 months thereafter. In addition, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride levels were measured at baseline and at the 6th month visit. Finally, at the end of follow-up, the patient's satisfaction was assessed. No differences between groups at the beginning of the study and during the follow-up were observed. A significant reduction in Blatt - Kupperman scores were observed in the two groups. In addition, the reduction of the symptoms was more intense in the first 3 months. Increasing doses of IOVE add no beneficial effects since both studied doses were equally effective in the reduction of climacteric complaints.
