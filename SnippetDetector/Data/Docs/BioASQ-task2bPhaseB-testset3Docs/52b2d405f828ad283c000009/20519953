Cell migration is a central part of physiological and pathophysiological processes including wound healing, immune defense, matrix remodeling and organ homeostasis. Different cell types have migratory potential including cells of the immune system and cells required in wound healing and tissue repair. These cells migrate locally through the tissue to the site of damage. The fibroblast is a central cell type of wound healing. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), activated synovial fibroblasts (SFs) have the ability to invade joint cartilage, actively contributing to joint destruction in RA. Recently, RASFs have been shown to be able to migrate to non-affected areas and joints through the blood stream and to invade distant cartilage. RASFs most likely use similar mechanisms comparable to lymphocytes and tumor cells for long-distance and vascular trans-migration. Future experiments will address the goal to keep the transformed-appearing fibroblasts in the affected joints using therapeutical strategies that inhibit the pathophysiological changes of transformed-appearing RASFs but do not interfere with the physiological processes of 'normal' fibroblasts.
