Thyroid hormones are known to be essential for growth, development and metabolism. Recently mutations in the SLC16A2 gene coding for the monocarboxylate thyroid hormone transporter 8, MCT8, have been associated with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X-linked condition characterized by severe mental retardation, dysarthria, athetoid movements, muscle hypoplasia and spastic paraplegia. Here we describe in detail the clinical and biochemical features in a boy affected by AHDS with severe neurological abnormalities and a novel de novo SLC16A2 gene insertion, 1343-1344insGCCC, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the last four transmembrane domains (TMDs) as well as the carboxyl cytoplasmic end. He presents mental retardation, axial hypotonia, hypertonia of arms and legs, paroxysmal dyskinesias, seizures. The endocrine phenotype showed low serum total and free thyroxine (T4), very elevated total and free triiodothyronine (T3) and normal thyrotropin (TSH) with blunted response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The latter finding was unexpected and suggested that the lack of functional MCT8 was counterbalanced at the thyrotrope cell level by high serum T3 concentration and/or by increased intrapituitary type 2 deiodinase (D2) activity. Our case constitutes a relevant contribution to better characterize this disorder and to elucidate the functional consequences of SLC16A2 gene mutations.
