We previously reported that intramyocardial injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing Akt (Akt-MSCs) inhibits ventricular remodeling and restores cardiac function measured 2 wk after myocardial infarction. Here, we report that the functional improvement occurs in < 72 h. This early remarkable effect cannot be readily attributed to myocardial regeneration from the donor cells. Thus, we hypothesized that paracrine actions exerted by the cells through the release of soluble factors might be important mechanisms of tissue repair and functional improvement after injection of the Akt-MSCs. Indeed, in the current study we demonstrate that conditioned medium from hypoxic Akt-MSCs markedly inhibits hypoxia-induced apoptosis and triggers vigorous spontaneous contraction of adult rat cardiomyocytes in vitro. When injected into infarcted hearts, the Akt-MSC conditioned medium significantly limits infarct size and improves ventricular function relative to controls. Support to the paracrine hypothesis is provided by data showing that several genes, coding for factors (VEGF, FGF-2, HGF, IGF-I, and TB4) that are potential mediators of the effects exerted by the Akt-MSC conditioned medium, are significantly up-regulated in the Akt-MSCs, particularly in response to hypoxia. Taken together, our data support Akt-MSC-mediated paracrine mechanisms of myocardial protection and functional improvement.
