We have investigated a family in which three siblings with the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis had unaffected parents. The family were typed for polymorphic markers spanning the two genes known to cause tuberous sclerosis located at 9q34 (TSC1) and 16p13.3 (TSC2). TSC1 markers showed different maternal and paternal haplotypes in affected children, excluding a mutation in TSC1 as the cause of the disease. For the TSC2 markers all the affected children had the same maternal and paternal haplotypes, as did three of their unaffected siblings. Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother. This is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism.
