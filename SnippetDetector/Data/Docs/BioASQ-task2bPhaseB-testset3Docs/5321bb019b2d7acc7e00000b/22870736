OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and serum triiodothyronine (T3) in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: 156 cases of CHF patients and 75 cases of cardiac function I patients hospitalized over the same period were utilized in this study. On admission, the patient's BNP and T3 plasma concentrations were measured. The correlation analysis of plasma BNP and T3 in CHF patients with cardiac function classification was conducted. RESULTS: According to the NYHA grading systems, the plasma BNP levels in patients with II, III, and IV grade CHF were significantly higher than those with cardiac function I (P < 0.05); BNP levels and NYHA grading of cardiac function correlated positively. The BNP concentrations increased with CHF progression (P < 0.01). The T3 level and NYHA grading of cardiac function correlated negatively.TheT3 level decreased as the degree of heart failure increased. Using CHF in combination with BNP to predict the occurrence of CHF had a sensitivity value of 90.8% with 95.5% specificity, 86.3% accuracy, and a negative predictive value of 87.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma BNP was more sensitive than T3 in the diagnosis of CHF. The T3 was more meaningful than the BNP in the prognosis of CHF. The BNP and T3 combination detection was more valuable in determining the severity of CHF and prognosis.
