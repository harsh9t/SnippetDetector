OBJECTIVE: Pericardial effusion has recently been reported as a complication of anorexia nervosa. A distinct pathophysiological cause of it could not be revealed. In some reports, there was a probable correlation between weight gain and reduction of pericardial effusion in anorexia nervosa cases. We encountered a case in which pericardial effusion remitted completely along with body weight increase and normalization of low T3 syndrome. These findings suggest that the reduction of pericardial effusion may correlate with both weight gain and low T3 normalization. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were increased in this case despite heart failure, and plasma BNP decreased as pericardial effusion remitted. The measurement of serum BNP level may be a clinical parameter in such a case of pericardial effusion.
