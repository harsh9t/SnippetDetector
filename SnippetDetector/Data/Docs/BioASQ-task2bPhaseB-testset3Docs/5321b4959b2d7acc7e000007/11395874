In developed countries diabetics patients are the most numerous group with renal replacement therapy (USA 34%). The main and diagnostically irreplaceable criterion of incipient diabetic nephropathy is microalbuminuria which is usually associated with hypertension and poor glycaemic compensation. With advancing microalbuminuria progresses diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. The increased transcapillary albumin escape rate and changes of some haemocoagulation factors in diabetics patients with microalbuminuria indicate that endothelial dysfunction is involved. In type 1 diabetes microalbuminuria is an indicator of increased mortality in which participate in particular cardiovascular diseases and to a minor extent renal failure. In type 2 diabetes microalbuminuria is an independent risk of generalized vascular disease. Microalbuminuria is also in non-diabetic subjects with hypertension associated with abnormalities such as impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, an unflavourable lipidogram and altered diurnal blood pressure rhythm. The results of a coronarographic investigation revealed that the risk of severe coronary artery disease is more than double in subjects with microalbuminuria. Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are causal risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and concurrent microalbuminuria implies a higher expression of already existing microvascular damage in hormonal and metabolic disorders with an atherogenic potential.
