The effect of hypotensive therapy on the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TERalb) was studied in eight hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients (mean age 29, range 19-42 years) with nephropathy and retinopathy. Transcapillary escape rate of albumin (initial disappearance of intravenously injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin), urinary albumin excretion rate (radial immunodiffusion), and glomerular filtrate rate (single bolus 51-Cr-EDTA technique) were measured. After hypotensive treatment (mean duration, 23 months, range 7-39 months) with combinations of metoprolol, hydralazine, and frusemide or thiazide diuretics, arterial blood pressure fell from 152/103 +/- 18/6 mmHg (mean +/- SD) to 133/81 +/- 12/10 mmHg (p less than 0.01), transcapillary escape rate of albumin from 10.2 +/- 1.8 to 8.1 +/- 1.8% of intravascular mass of albumin/h (p less than 0.01), albuminuria from 1803 (370-5066) micrograms/min to 940 (101-2676) micrograms/min (median and range, p less than 0.05), and glomerular filtration rate from 103 +/- 23 to 84 +/- 22 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p less than 0.01). Our study suggests that effective hypotensive treatment reduces the abnormally elevated albumin leakage characteristically found in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with clinical microangiopathy. This may be due to a reduction in the hydrostatic pressure in the microcirculation.
