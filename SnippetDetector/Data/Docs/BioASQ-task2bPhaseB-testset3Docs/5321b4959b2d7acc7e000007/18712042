Sub-clinical organ damage is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in primary hypertension, and its changes over time parallel those in risk of cardiovascular events. A better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the development of target organ damage may help us devise more effective therapeutic strategies. We therefore investigated the relationship between the presence of organ damage and some of its potential determinants, such as blood pressure severity and early atherosclerotic abnormalities. Thirty-seven untreated, non-diabetic hypertensive patients were enrolled. Target organ damage was assessed by albuminuria and left ventricular mass index; systemic vascular permeability was evaluated by transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TERalb); and blood pressure was measured by 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The albumin-to-creatinine ratio and left ventricular mass index were directly related to TERalb (r = 0.48, p = 0.003 and r = 0.39, p < 0.020, respectively) and 24-h systolic blood pressure values (r = 0.54, p < 0.001; r = 0.60, p < 0.001). The simultaneous occurrence of increased blood pressure load and TERalb was associated with higher left ventricular mass index values (p = 0.012) and entailed an increased risk of having at least one sign of damage (chi2 = 17.4; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of presenting at least one sign of organ damage increased more than ten-fold when TERalb was above the median and more than five-fold with each 10 mmHg increase in 24-h systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure load and vascular permeability are potentially modifiable factors that are independently associated with the occurrence of sub-clinical signs of renal and cardiac damage in hypertensive patients.
