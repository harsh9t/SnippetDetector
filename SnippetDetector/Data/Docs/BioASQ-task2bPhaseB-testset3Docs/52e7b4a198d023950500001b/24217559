<abstract>
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) structure, function, and mechanics in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SHT), and to evaluate the effect of a 1-year levothyroxine treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We compared 45 untreated women with subclinical hypothyroidism and 35 healthy control women matched by age. All the subjects underwent laboratory analyses, which included a thyroid hormone levels (free T3, free T4, and TSH) test, and a complete 2-dimensional echocardiographic study. All the SHT patients received levothyroxine therapy and were followed for a year after euthyroid state was achieved. RESULTS: The LV mass index in the SHT participants before and after replacement therapy was significantly higher than in controls. In the SHT patients before the treatment, LV diastolic function and global function estimated by the Tei index were significantly impaired, whereas the LV systolic function was decreased. The results show that LV mechanics was significantly impaired in the SHT patients at baseline. Additionally, the SHT participants before levothyroxine substitution had increased RV wall thickness and significantly impaired RV diastolic and global function in comparison with the controls or the SHT subjects after the treatment. Furthermore, RV mechanics was also significantly deteriorated in the SHT patients before the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism significantly affected LV and RV structure, systolic, diastolic and global function, and LV and RV mechanics. Levothyroxine replacement therapy significantly improved cardiac structure, function, and mechanics in the SHT patients.

Background
hyroid hormones have significant influence on the cardiovascular system [1]. ypothyroidism is associated with impaired cardiac function [2]; studies have shown that subclinical hypothyroidism () and mild hypothyroidism are associated with left ventricular () dysfunction, especially diastolic dysfunction [3β€“8], but the mechanisms of this relationship are still insufficiently investigated. lthough researchers revealed that substitution therapy with levothyroxine in the  patients could improve  function and cause reversion of  diastolic dysfunction [9β€“12], many controversies remain about the favorable influence of therapy on  remodeling.

Thyroid hormones have significant influence on the cardiovascular system [1]. Hypothyroidism is associated with impaired cardiac function [2]; studies have shown that subclinical hypothyroidism (SHT) and mild hypothyroidism are associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, especially diastolic dysfunction [3β€“8], but the mechanisms of this relationship are still insufficiently investigated. Although researchers revealed that substitution therapy with levothyroxine in the SHT patients could improve LV function and cause reversion of LV diastolic dysfunction [9β€“12], many controversies remain about the favorable influence of therapy on LV remodeling.
The impact of thyroid hormones on right ventricular (RV) structure and function, especially in the SHT patients, is still unknown. The RV has long been considered as an β€�insignificantβ€� heart chamber, as long as studies showed that RV hypertrophy and dysfunction are related with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [13,14]. However, because of its complex geometry, the RV could be very difficult to assess echocardiographically, which is why cardiac MR has long been considered as a gold standard for RV imaging. The estimation of RV function and mechanics became available and reliable after the introduction of new echocardiographic tools such as tissue Doppler and speckle tracking imaging. A few studies have shown that RV remodeling, particularly RV diastolic dysfunction, occurs parallel to LV changes, and that levothyroxine therapy also has favorable influence on reversibility of RV diastolic dysfunction [15,16].
To our knowledge, ours the first study to use 2-dimensional speckle tracking imaging to assess the effect of SHT and levothyroxine replacement therapy on LV and RV mechanics. In the present study, we investigated LV and RV structure, function, and mechanics in SHT patients and evaluated the effect of replacement therapy on LV and RV remodeling.

Material and ethods
e enrolled 45 female patients with untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and 35 age-matched healthy female volunteers. he study was conducted at the ndocrinology and ardiology epartment, niversity linical ospital entre β€�r ragisa isovicβ€� in elgrade, erbia, between anuary 2010 and ay 2013. he cause of  in all patients was chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (diagnosed by increased circulating antiperoxidase and/or anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies and diffuse hypoechogenicity imaged by thyroid ultrasound). he inclusion criteria were age (β‰¤45 years) and increased serum  level with normal levels of 3 and 4. ubjects with symptoms or signs of cardiovascular disease (arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, congenital heart disease, valvular disease), obesity ( β‰¥30 kg/m2), asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, neoplastic disease, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney failure, sleeping disorders, or type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study.
nthropometric measures (height and weight), and laboratory analyses (level of thyroid hormones, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and  and  cholesterol) were taken from all study subjects. asting venous blood samples were drawn between the hours of 0800 and 0900. one of the participants used any medication one year before inclusion in the study or during the study. he normal ranges for 3, 4, and  are 1.5β€“4.1 pg/ml, 11.5β€“22.7 pmol/l, and 0.4β€“4 m. IU/l, respectively. FT3 level was determined by IMMULITE 1000 (a competitive analog-based immunoassay); FT4 level was assessed by IMMULITE 2000 enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay; and TSH level was determined by using IMMULITE 2000 (a third-generation TSH, 2-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay). After baseline assessment, patients with SHT were assigned to receive levothyroxine replacement starting with 25 ΞΌg/d. TSH was measured every 8 weeks for dose adjustment. Euthyroid state was achieved with a mean dose of 71 ΞΌg/d in 19.6Β±5.8 weeks. Echocardiographic examination was performed before starting the treatment, and by levothyroxine therapy 1 year after euthyroid state was achieved. Body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) were calculated for each patient. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from all the participants.
EchocardiographyEchocardiographic examination was performed by using a Vivid 7 ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, Horten, Norway) equipped with a 2.5 MHz transducer with harmonic capability.Standard two-dimensional (2DE) echocardiographic examinationThe values of all 2DE parameters were obtained as the average value of 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. The LV end-systolic and end-diastolic (LVEDD) diameters, the left ventricle posterior wall (PWT), and interventricular septum thickness were determined according to the current recommendations [17]. Relative wall thickness was calculated as (2xPWT)/LVEDD. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was estimated by using the biplane method. Left ventricular mass was calculated by using the Devereux formula [18], and was indexed for height powered to 2.7.Transmitral Doppler inflow and tissue-pulsed Doppler were obtained in the apical 4-chamber view. Pulsed Doppler measurements included the transmitral early diastolic peak flow velocity (E), late diastolic flow velocity (A), their ratio (E/A), and E velocity deceleration time (DT) [19]. Tissue Doppler imaging was used to obtain left ventricular myocardial velocities in the apical 4-chamber view, with a sample volume placed at the septal segment of the mitral annulus during early and late diastole (eβ€™ and aβ€™) and systole (s). Using tissue Doppler, we also determined early diastolic velocity across a lateral segment of the mitral annulus and computed the average early diastolic relaxation velocity (eβ€™av) of the septal and lateral mitral annulus; this was used for further calculation of the E/eβ€™av ratio.The parameters necessary for calculating the Tei index were obtained by the tissue Doppler in the apical 4-chamber view. A 2-mm sample volume was placed at the lateral corner of the mitral annulus. Isovolumic contraction time (IVCT) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) were measured from the end of the mitral annular velocity pattern to the onset of the systolic wave, and from the end of the systolic wave to the onset of the mitral annular velocity pattern, respectively. The ejection time (ET) was defined as the duration of the left ventricle outflow Doppler velocity profile. The Tei index was then calculated according to the formula: Tei index = (IVCT + IVRT)/ET [20].Two-dimensional left ventricular strain2DE strain imaging was performed by using 3consecutive cardiac cycles of 2DE LV images in apical (long-axis 4-chamber view) [21]. The frame rate ranged between 50 and 70Hz. A commercially available software, 2DE Auto LVQ software (EchoPAC 110.1.2, GE-Healthcare, Horten, Norway), was used for 2DE strain analysis. The 2DE longitudinal strain and strain rate were calculated by averaging all 6 values of the regional peak longitudinal strain obtained in 4-chamber apical view. We separately estimated peak longitudinal strain of the LV, interventricular septum, and LV lateral wall.Right ventricle and atriumThe RV internal end-diastolic diameter was measured in M-mode in the parasternal long-axis view [22]. RV end-diastolic thickness was measured in the subcostal view [22]. Two-dimensional RV volumes and ejection fraction were calculated by using the modified Simpsonβ€™s rule [22]. The right atrial (RA) diameters were measured in the apical 4-chamber view at the ventricular end-systole [22].Pulsed Doppler measurements across the tricuspid annulus included early and late diastolic flow velocity, their ratio (E/At), and deceleration time (DTt). Tissue Doppler imaging was used to obtain the RV myocardial velocities in the apical 4-chamber view with a sample volume placed at the lateral segment of the tricuspid annulus [22]. Acquisition was performed at end-expiration during quite breathing. RV global systolic function was assessed as the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) [22].The parameters necessary for calculation of the Tei index of the right ventricle were obtained by the tissue Doppler in the apical 4-chamber view. The RV Tei index was calculated similarly as for the LV, according to the current guidelines [22].RV systolic blood pressure (SPAP) was assessed in a subset of patients with minimal/mild tricuspid regurgitation.Two-dimensional right ventricular strainTwo-dimensional strain imaging was performed by using 3 consecutive cardiac cycles in the apical 4-chamber view [22]. The frame rate ranged between 60 and 80 frames/s. EchoPAC 110.1.2 (GE-Healthcare, Horten, Norway) commercially available software was used for the 2DE strain analysis. Longitudinal peak strain was the variable used for evaluation of systolic function and contractility. We separately estimated peak strains of the RV and free wall.Statistical analysisNormal distribution of all variables was verified using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous variables are presented as mean Β± standard deviation (SD) and were compared by using the 2-tailed t-test. Comparisons between the controls and the patients were performed by an independent-samples t-test. The data before and after L-thyroxin therapy were compared by a paired-samples t-test. The differences in proportions were compared by using the Ο‡2 test. The correlations were determined by the Pearson rank correlation test. Inter- and intra-observer variability was examined by using Bland-Altmann analysis. We reported relation coefficients, 95% confidence intervals, and percent errors. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
he  patients and the controls had similar age, heart rate, blood pressure, , , triglycerides, and -cholesterol level (able 1). 3 and 4 levels were similar between the controls and the  patients, but  level was significantly elevated in the  group in comparison with the controls and the treated patients. he total cholesterol and -cholesterol levels were increased in the  patients before the treatment in comparison with the controls and the  patients after levothyroxine treatment (able 1).
eft ventricular structure, function, and mechanics. The LV diameters and volumes were similar among the SHT patients and the controls (Table 2), but LV EF was lower in the SHT patients at baseline in comparison with the controls and the SHT patients after the therapy. IVS and PWT were significantly increased in the SHT patients before the therapy in comparison with the controls (Table 2). The LV mass index was significantly increased in the SHT patients before the therapy in comparison with the controls and the treated SHT subjects (Table 2). There was no important difference in LA diameter between the SHT patients and the controls. Transmitral E/A and eβ€™/aβ€™ ratios were decreased in the SHT patients before the therapy in comparison with the controls and the SHT patients after therapy. Additionally, DTm and IVRTm were significantly prolonged, and E/eβ€™av was increased, in the SHT patients before the treatment (Table 2). Mitral s was significantly decreased, whereas the LV Tei index was increased in the patients before substitution therapy.The LV global longitudinal strain was significantly decreased in the SHT patients at baseline in comparison with the controls and the SHT patients after the levothyroxine therapy (Table 2). Similar results were obtained for septal and LV lateral wall strain.Right ventricular structure, function, and mechanicsThe RV diameter and volumes did not differ between the SHT patients and the controls, regardless of therapy; whereas RV wall thickness was significantly increased in the SHT patients before the treatment (Table 3). Interestingly, RV EF assessed by the biplanes rule was lower in the SHT patients before the treatment in comparison with the controls.The RA diameters were similar between the controls and the SHT patients (Table 3). Tricuspid E/A and eβ€™/aβ€™ ratio were decreased in the SHT patients before the therapy in comparison with the controls or with the SHT patients after the therapy. There was no difference in E/eβ€™t, st, TAPSE, and SPAP between the SHT patients and the controls (Table 3). Global RV function obtained by the Tei index was significantly impaired in the SHT patients before the therapy in comparison with the SHT participants after the therapy or the controls (Table 3).Longitudinal RV strain was decreased in the untreated SHT patients in comparison with treated SHT subjects or healthy volunteers (Table 3). Similar results were obtained for free wall strain (Table 3).Correlation and regression analysesConsidering the entire study population (the SHT patients before and after levothyroxine therapy, and controls), TSH level correlated with LV mass index (r=0.47, p<0.01), E/Am ratio (r=β�’0.32, p<0.01), E/eβ€™m ratio (r=0.37, p<0.01), LV Tei index (r=0.43, p<0.01), and LV global longitudinal strain (r=β�’0.51, p<0.01) among LV parameters; and also correlated with E/At ratio (r=β�’0.28, p=0.02), E/eβ€™t (r=0.39, p<0.01), RV Tei index (r=0.4, p<0.01), and RV global longitudinal strain (r=β�’0.48, p<0.01) among RV parameters. However, after adjustment for LV mass index and RV wall thickness, in the whole study population, TSH was associated only with LV Tei index (Ξ²=0.39, p<0.01), LV longitudinal strain (Ξ²=β�’0.47, p<0.01), and RV longitudinal strain (Ξ²=β�’0.32, p=0.025).Interobserver variabilityBland-Altman analyses was: Mitral E/eβ€™av (95% CI Β±2.7; percentage error 5.1%); LV Tei index (95% CI Β±2.4; percentage error 4.5%); global LV strain (95% CI Β±2; percentage error 4.1%); Tricuspid E/eβ€™ (95% CI Β±2.9; percentage error 5.5%); RV Tei index (95% CI Β±3.1; percentage error 5.8%); Global RV strain (95% CI Β±2.9; percentage error 5.4%).Intraobserver variabilityBland-Altman analyses was: Mitral E/eβ€™av (95% CI Β±2.1; percentage error 4.1%); LV Tei index (95% CI Β±1.8; percentage error 3.9%); Global LV strain (95% CI Β±1.5; percentage error 3.4%); Tricuspid E/eβ€™ (95% CI Β±2.2; percentage error 4.7%); RV Tei index (95% CI Β±2.4; percentage error 5.2%); Global RV strain (95% CI Β±2.2; percentage error 4.6%).

Discussion
here are several important findings in our study: (i)  undergoes structural and functional remodeling in , which means that  structure, as well as systolic, diastolic and global function, are impaired in these patients; (ii)  mechanics is compromised in the  patients; (iii)  structure and diastolic and global function are affected by ; (iv)  mechanics is also affected by ; and (v)  level is associated with  and  mechanics independently of  mass index and  wall thickness.
ypothyroidism could induce cardiac remodeling in 3 ways. irstly, by decreasing activity of some enzymes included in intracellular calcium handling, which further changes the expression of contractile protein [2,22,24]. econdly, chronic inflammation [25] and tissue changes (e.g., collagen alteration, dehydration, myocardial fiber orientation or capillary distribution) in a condition of  could be responsible for cardiac dysfunction [26,27]. t has been speculated that  and mild hypothyroidism are related to initial signs of cardiovascular hypothyroidism [26]. hirdly,  is associated with hemodynamic changes that could also induce cardiac impairment [26].
ur results show that the  patients had increased  mass index in comparison with the controls, as confirmed by some authors [11,15,28], but our results disagree with those of others [3,6,7,29]. imilarly, levothyroxine therapy induced the reduction of  wall thickness and  mass in some investigations [11], but it did not cause significant improvement in other studies [10]. he more recent studies agree with our results. n addition to the above-mentioned mechanism that could induce  hypertrophy in a condition of , increased systemic vascular resistance [30,31] and activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system could also have a significant role in hemodynamic and structural changes of the  [2,32].
lthough more investigators have demonstrated that  has an unfavorable influence on  diastolic function [4,10,12,16,28], which also concurs with our results, there is still a lack of agreement on this topic because many studies disagree with these findings [5β€“7,9]. owever, a recently published meta-analysis that included 675  participants younger than 60 years of age has concluded that  diastolic dysfunction is significantly more prevalent in the  patients than in the healthy, age- and gender-matched controls [33]. tudies that evaluated the effects of levothyroxine therapy in  patients show the positive influence of this therapy on  diastolic function [4,10,11], which agrees with our findings and confirms the favorable relationship between thyroid hormones and  function.
he impact of  on  systolic function is more controversial. ipoli et al. used cardiac  for estimation of  function, and, even if the difference in ejection fraction was 4% (65% vs. 61%) between the  patients and the controls, it was not enough to reach statistical significance due to small sample size [31]. n our study, a difference of only 2% in  ejection fraction was sufficient to show a statistically significant difference between the  patients at baseline and the controls or the  patients after the treatment. owever, ipoli et al. succeeded in showing that  patients had reduced end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and cardiac index in comparison with the controls [31]. imilar results regarding unchanged  ejection fraction among the  patients were also obtained by other researchers [6,7,11,12,28]. owever, tissue oppler analysis showed impaired  systolic function in the  population [3,34]. dditionally, global  function estimated by the ei index is also impaired in  and is significantly improved after levothyroxine substitution [11].
nterest in  mechanics has been increasing. iryakioglu et al. showed that patients with overt hypothyroidism have impaired  longitudinal function as assessed by tissue oppler and strain imaging [35]. n another study,  deformation of all 16 segments of the  was impaired in hypothyroid patients in comparison with controls [35], and to our best knowledge a similar study has not been previously done in the  population. ur results showed depression of  global longitudinal strain and strain of the  lateral wall and interventricular septum in the  patients. e demonstrated that  mechanical disturbances disappeared after levothyroxine treatment, and  level was found to be associated with  global strain independently of  mass index. hese results show that  hypertrophy is not the only mechanism responsible for  dysfunction in  patients. emodynamic changes in , led by increased systemic vascular resistance, have a very important, maybe crucial, role in the relationship between thyroid hormones and  mechanics.
he  has been significantly less studied, mostly because of its complicated anatomy and lack of a reliable and accessible imaging tool. nly a few studies have examined  structure and function in  patients. urhan et al. showed that  is associated with  systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and revealed that levothyroxine therapy improves these abnormalities [16]. osar et al. demonstrated an association between clinical hypothyroidism and  diastolic dysfunction [15], but iafar et al. did not find any difference in  systolic or diastolic function between  subjects and controls [6]. everal studies failed to detect any difference in  wall thickness between the observed groups [15,16]. ur results demonstrate that  wall thickness was increased, and  diastolic and global functions were impaired in the  patients. nterestingly, osar et al. found an even greater difference than we did in  wall thickness between the patients with clinical hypothyroidism and the controls, but this still was insufficient to reach statistical significance due to small sample size [15]. n our study, levothyroxine treatment improved diastolic and global  functions, but did not significantly reduce  wall thickness.
o date,  mechanics has not been estimated in the  population. ur research revealed that  mechanics assessed by speckle tracking imaging is significantly impaired in the  subjects. pecifically, global  strain and strain of  free wall were decreased in the  patients in comparison with the healthy controls.  mechanism that can explain the relationship between  remodeling and  is elevated  filling pressure, which is reflected by the increased /eβ€™t that we obtained in our study. ther possible mechanisms are  hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary circulation, increased sympathetic and  activity, and impaired a2+ handling in , which could induce elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. inally, the interaction between  and  is certainly one of the most important causes of  impairment in  patients due to transmission of increased  filling pressure through pulmonary circulation to the . owever, our study revealed that  is associated with  mechanics independently of  mass index and  wall thickness. dditionally, we showed that impairment of  mechanics is completely reversible after adequate replacement therapy.
imitations. Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the relatively small number of patients could be a limitation to our study. Secondly, our investigation included only women (SHT is mostly seen in females, which is why we decided to include only women), which restricts our results to this population. Thirdly, the existence of coronary artery disease (CAD) was not excluded by coronary angiography; however, our study included young females without other cardiovascular risk factors and expected prevalence of CAD in this population is very low.

LV and RV structure and systolic, diastolic, and global function are impaired in SHT patients. LV and RV mechanics are also damaged in the SHT subjects. Impairments in LV and RV function and mechanics were reversed after adequate treatment with levothyroxine, whereas structural cardiac damage did not significantly improve. This shows that a longer time of treatment is probably needed to achieve this kind of improvement. TSH level correlates with LV and RV structure, diastolic and global function, and LV and RV mechanics. However, after adjustment for LV and RV hypertrophy, TSH was associated only with LV global function and LV and RV mechanics. Further longitudinal analyses with a greater number of patients are needed to validate the possible impact of LV and RV mechanical changes on morbidity and mortality in SHT subjects.
