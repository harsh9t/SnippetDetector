This review evaluates the hypothesis that the cardiac effects of amiodarone can be explained-at least partly-by the induction of a local 'hypothyroid-like condition' in the heart. Evidence supporting the hypothesis comprises the observation that amiodarone exerts an inhibitory effect on the binding of T3 to thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha-1 and beta-1 in vitro, and on the expression of particular T3-dependent genes in vivo. In the heart, amiodarone decreases heart rate and alpha myosin heavy chain expression (mediated via TR alpha-1), and increases sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-activated ATPase and beta myosin heavy chain expression (mediated via TR beta-1). Recent data show a significant similarity in expression profiles of 8,435 genes in the heart of hypothyroid and amiodarone-treated animals, although similarities do not always exist in transcripts of ion channel genes. Induction of a hypothyroid cardiac phenotype by amiodarone may be advantageous by decreasing energy demands and increasing energy availability.

Introduction
he heart is an important target organ for thyroid hormone as evident from clinical practice [1]. n hyperthyroid patients there is an increased resting heart rate, increased left ventricular contractility, increased cardiac output and a decreased systemic vascular resistance, resulting in a lower diastolic and higher systolic blood pressure; serum cholesterol is decreased and patients are susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias, specifically to atrial fibrilation. n contrast, hypothyroid patients have a decreased heart rate, impaired cardiac contractility and diastolic function, decreased cardiac output and an increased systemic vascular resistance, resulting in a higher diastolic blood pressure; serum cholesterol is increased and patients are susceptible to accelerated atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. he aberrant cardiovascular functions in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients are usually fully reversible upon restoration of the euthyroid state.
miodarone, introduced originally as an anti-anginal agent but nowadays used as a very potent antiarrhytmic drug, lowers heart rate, lengthens the cardiac action potential (manifest as a longer c interval on the ), and depresses myocardial oxygen consumption [2]. n addition, amiodarone increases plasma cholesterol [3]. imilarities between the effects of amiodarone and of hypothyroidism are striking. t has therefore been hypothesized that the cardiac effects of amiodarone can be explainedβ€”at least partlyβ€”by the induction of a local β€�hypothyroid-likeβ€™ condition in the heart [3]. n this review we present evidence in favour of this hypothesis derived from experimental animal studies focussing on nuclear 3 receptors and thyroid hormone-dependent gene expression in the heart.Introduction
The heart is an important target organ for thyroid hormone as evident from clinical practice [1]. In hyperthyroid patients there is an increased resting heart rate, increased left ventricular contractility, increased cardiac output and a decreased systemic vascular resistance, resulting in a lower diastolic and higher systolic blood pressure; serum cholesterol is decreased and patients are susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias, specifically to atrial fibrilation. In contrast, hypothyroid patients have a decreased heart rate, impaired cardiac contractility and diastolic function, decreased cardiac output and an increased systemic vascular resistance, resulting in a higher diastolic blood pressure; serum cholesterol is increased and patients are susceptible to accelerated atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. The aberrant cardiovascular functions in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients are usually fully reversible upon restoration of the euthyroid state.
Amiodarone, introduced originally as an anti-anginal agent but nowadays used as a very potent antiarrhytmic drug, lowers heart rate, lengthens the cardiac action potential (manifest as a longer QTc interval on the EKG), and depresses myocardial oxygen consumption [2]. In addition, amiodarone increases plasma cholesterol [3]. Similarities between the effects of amiodarone and of hypothyroidism are striking. It has therefore been hypothesized that the cardiac effects of amiodarone can be explainedβ€”at least partlyβ€”by the induction of a local β€�hypothyroid-likeβ€™ condition in the heart [3]. In this review we present evidence in favour of this hypothesis derived from experimental animal studies focussing on nuclear T3 receptors and thyroid hormone-dependent gene expression in the heart.

Hypothyroidism
enomic effects of thyroid hormone in the heart are mediated via nuclear 3 receptors (). here are several isoforms of s: ±1 and ²1 (which both bind the ligand 3) and ±2 (which does not bind 3 but is able to bind to thyroid response elements () and may exert a dominant negative effect on gene expression). he heart is a predominantly ±1 organ, although ²1 is also expressed albeit at a lower level. n rats made hypothyroid by adding 0.05% propylthiouracil to their drinking water for 2 weeks, we did not observe any changes in atrial or ventricular gene expression of the three s relative to controls, neither at the m. RNA level nor at the protein level [4]. Other models, however, did show changes in the expression of particular TR isoforms in hypothyroid rats [5, 6]. The discrepancy can be explained by the more severe hypothyroidism in these earlier studies by using propylthiouracil for a longer period of time (six instead of our 2Β weeks) or combining propylthiouracil with a low iodine diet [5, 6]. Because in our model cardiac TR levels are not affected by thyroid hormone deficiency, observed changes in the expression of T3-dependent genes in the hypothyroid heart are likely attributed to a low occupancy rate of TR with T3.
There are a number of T3-responsive genes in the heart encoding for proteins involved in cardiac contractility. Examples are the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-activated ATPase (SERCA2a) which is responsible for the calcium reuptake during the diastole and is activated by T3 [7], and the two myosin heavy chains Ξ± and Ξ² (Ξ±MHC and Ξ²MHC, respectively) which are myofibrillar proteins that make up the thick filament of the cardiac myocyte contractile apparatus. In rodents, transcription of Ξ±MHC is activated by T3, whereas transcription of Ξ²MHC is repressed by T3 [8, 9]. In our experimental model, hypothyroidism was associated with a downregulation of Ξ±MHC and an upregulation of Ξ²MHC (both at the mRNA and at the protein level) in atria and ventricles; SERCA2a was significantly downregulated in atria and ventricles [4]. The observed changes are in good agreement with previous reports in the literature [8β€“10]. Downregulation of Ξ±MHC (the fast myosin with higher ATPase activity) under simultaneous upregulation of Ξ²MHC (the slow myosin), together with the downregulation of SERCA2a explains to a certain extent the decreased cardiac contractility associated with hypothyroidism [1]. Modulation of Ξ±MHC transcription is linked to the TRΞ±1 isoform, whereas transcription of Ξ²MHC and SERCA2a genes seems to be under control of TRΞ²1 [11].

Amiodarone
miodarone treatment (100 mg/kg/day orally for 2 weeks) influences cardiac  m. RNA expression [12]: TRΞ±1 is decreased in the right atrium but increased in the left ventricular wall, TRΞ±2 remains unchanged at these locations, and TRΞ²1 is decreased both in the right atrium and the left ventricular wall. The overall downregulation of TR by amiodarone is similar to the reported downregulation of TRΞ±1 and TRΞ²1 in the post-infarcted rat heart, which shows a hypothyroid cardiac phenotype [13].
Amiodarone treatment also influenced thyroid hormone-dependent gene expression in our experimental rat model at the mRNA level [12]: SERCA2a was reduced in the right atrium, Ξ±MHC was reduced both in the right atrium and left ventricular apex, whereas Ξ²MHC was increased in the right atrium, left ventricular wall and apex. The findings are in good agreement with the literature [14].
The data strongly suggests that amiodarone induces a hypothyroid-like phenotype with regard to T3-dependent gene expression in the heart. To learn about the mechanism by which amiodarone exerts these effects, we performed a number of inΒ vitro and inΒ vivo studies. First, inΒ vitro experiments demonstrated that amiodarone via its main metabolite desethylamiodarone (DEA) acts as a competitive inhibitor of T3 binding to TRΞ±1 (IC50 value 30Β Β±Β 3.9Β ΞΌM) and as a noncompetitive inhibitor of T3 binding to TRΞ²1 (IC50 value 71Β Β±Β 3.4Β ΞΌM) [15, 16]. Next to inhibition of T3 binding to TR, DEA may further affect T3-dependent gene expression by inhibition of co-activator binding to TR and inhibition of the TR binding to TRE [17, 18]. Second, DEA concentrations in the rat heart after amiodarone treatment (100Β mg/kg/day orally for 2Β weeks) are in the micromolar range (14Β ΞΌmol/kg) [19], close to the IC50 values of DEA for inhibiting T3 binding to TR inΒ vitro. The T3 concentrations in rat heart are 4Β times lower in amiodarone-treated animals than in control animals (1 vs 4Β nmol/kg, respectively) [20]. The marked decrease in myocardial T3 concentration is related to the decrease of plasma T3 and the impaired entrance of plasma-derived T3 in hearts of amiodarone-treated animals [21]. The reduction of cardiac TR and T3 concentrations will result in all likelihood in a low occupancy of TR with T3, which favours the inhibitory effects of DEA [15, 16]. The finding that amiodarone modulates the gene expression of both Ξ±MHC (mediated via TRΞ±1) and Ξ²MHC and SERCA2a (mediated via TRΞ²1) is in line with the inhibitory effect of DEA on the binding of T3 to both TRΞ±1 and TRΞ²1.

Dronedarone
ronedarone is a newly developed antiarrhythmic drug, structurally related to amiodarone. t lacks, however, the iodine moiety of amiodarone, and thereby iodine-related toxicity. ronedarone like amiodarone has antiadrenergic effects as well as blocking effects on many ion channels. ronedarone possesses rate-control and rhythm-control properties, and seems to be safe and effective in preventing recurrence of atrial fibrillation [22]. e wondered if part of the pharmacological actions of dronedarone could also be attributed to induction of a local hypothyroid-like condition in the heart.
n. Β vitro experiments demonstrate that debutyldronedarone (the major metabolite of dronedarone) inhibits the binding of T3 to TRΞ±1 (IC50 value 59Β Β±Β 4.1Β ΞΌM) much more strongly than the binding of T3 to TRΞ²1 (IC50 value 280Β Β±Β 29Β ΞΌM) [23]. Inhibition of T3 binding to TRΞ±1 by debutyldronedarone is competitive in nature. Treating rats with dronedarone (100Β mg/kg/day orally for 2Β weeks) decreases TRΞ±1 mRNA in the right atrium, decreases TRΞ²1 mRNA in right atrium, left ventricular wall and apex, whereas it does not affect TRΞ±2 mRNA in the heart [12]. With regard to T3-dependent gene expression, dronedarone did not change Ξ±MHC, Ξ²MHC and SERCA2a expression in the heart [12]. Pantos etΒ al. [24] also did not observe a change in Ξ²MHC or SERCA2a cardiac expression in rats treated with dronedarone (90Β mg/kg/d orally for 2Β weeks), but did find a significant decrease in Ξ±MHC and heart rate. These findings are most interesting: the presence of an effect of dronedarone on heart rate and Ξ±MHC (both TRΞ±1 mediated) and the absence of an effect of dronedarone on Ξ²MHC and SERCA2a (both TRΞ²1 mediated) reinforce the inΒ vitro findings that dronedarone acts as a selective TRΞ±1 antagonist. This has also been demonstrated in another rat study in which treatment with amiodarone reduced the expression of two TRΞ²1-dependent genes (as evident from a lower LDL receptor protein concentration and a lower iodothyronine-5β€²-deiodinase-activity in liver), whereas treatment with dronedarone did not [23].
Whether dronedarone like amiodarone also induces a local hypothyroid-like condition in the heart is less clear. However, further biochemical and functional studies showed many similarities in hearts of hypothyroid and dronedarone-treated rats, leading these authors to conclude that dronedarone treatment results in cardioprotection by selectively mimicking hypothyroidism [24].

Hypothyroid cardiac phenotype
miodarone treatment, like hypothyroidism, lowers heart rate, lenghthens the c interval, and lowers ± gene expression in the heart; these effects are ±1-mediated effects. miodarone treatment, like hypothyroidism, increases ² and decreases 2a gene expression in the heart; both effects are ²1-mediated effects. he data provides supportive evidence for the hypothesis that amiodarone induces a hypothyroid-like condition in the heart. miodarone apparently switches gene expression back into foetal programming of particular cardiac genes, which might have survival value for the organism.
he hypothesis is further strengthened by recent data from a microarray analysis of 8,435 genes in the left ventricular myocardium of rats [25]. here was a very significant similarity in expression profiles between hypothyroid and amiodarone-treated rats ( = 0.63,  < 0.00001); the correlation became even stronger when the top 100 up-regulated and 100 down-regulated genes in hypothyroidism were analyzed ( = 0.78,  < 0.00001).
s a final remark, however, it should be mentioned that not all pharmacological actions of amiodarone can be explained from the induction of a local hypothyroid-like condition in the heart. valuating the complete ion channel repertoire by real time  in hearts of mice treated with amiodarone, it became obvious that changes in transcript levels sometimes were similar to those seen in hypothyroid mice, but very frequently were completely different from the hypothyroid phenotype [26, 27]. evertheless, downregulation of the effect of thyroid hormone in the heart results in what has been called β€�cardiac metamorphosisβ€� [28], which by decreasing energy demands and increasing energy availability might be advantageous with potential therapeutic implications.Hypothyroid cardiac phenotype
