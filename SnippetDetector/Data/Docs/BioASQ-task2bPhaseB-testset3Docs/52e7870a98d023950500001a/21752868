OBJECTIVES: To investigate genotype-phenotype correlation and gene-environment interaction between PTPN22 R620W environmental factors such as tobacco/hormonal treatments in an inception cohort of RA patients. METHODS: An intra-cohort study including 532 Caucasian RA patients genotyped for the PTPN22 rs2476601 polymorphism was performed. Anti-CCP and RF status at baseline, presence of bone erosions at 1 year, HLADR1 and/or DR4 status, demography, comorbidities, exposure to tobacco with the cumulative dose in pack-years, hormonal treatments and treatments received for RA were collected. Logistic regression was performed to estimate the ORs and multiplicative interaction with adjustment for confounding factors. Gene-environment interaction was estimated by the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion (AP) and synergy index (SI). RESULTS: PTPN22 620W risk allele was associated with ACPA production [odds ratio (OR) = 2.21, 95% CI 1.4, 3.4, P < 0.0001]. Hormonal treatment exposition and smoking were found to act with a protective effect against ACPA production (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7, P = 0.001) and early bone erosion (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = 0.003), respectively, and independently of HLADR and PTPN22 status. No evidence for a gene-environment interaction was detected. CONCLUSION: These data provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA, underlying the pivotal key role of environmental factors in the typical heterogeneity of RA.
