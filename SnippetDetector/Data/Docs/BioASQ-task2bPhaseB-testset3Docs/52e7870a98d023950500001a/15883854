Several multiple, large-scale, genetic studies on autoimmune-disease-associated SNPs have been reported recently: peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); solute carrier family 22 members 4 and 5 (SLC22A4 and 5) in RA and Crohn's disease (CD); programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and RA; and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) in T1D, RA, and SLE. Because these reports on association were not always evaluated in multiple ethnic groups and because ethnic difference in allele frequency of the variants has been also reported, we investigated allele frequencies of nine SNPs in four autoimmune-disease-associated loci in Caucasian, African-descent, and Japanese populations. Although SNPs in PADI4 had similar allele frequency among three groups [maximal difference 11%; (P >0.05)], the other three loci revealed statistically significant allele frequency differences (maximal difference 39% (P <0.00001), 13% (P <0.00001), and 8% (P <0.00001) in SLC22A4, PDCD1, and PTPN22, respectively). Of note, three SNPs in the three loci that had allele frequency more than 8% in the Caucasian population were either not polymorphic at all or extremely rare in the Japanese population. Our data suggest that ethnic variations of polymorphisms should be evaluated in detail, and differences should be incorporated into investigations of susceptibility variants for common diseases.
