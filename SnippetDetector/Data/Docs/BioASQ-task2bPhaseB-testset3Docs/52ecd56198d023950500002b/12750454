Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment in growth. Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1. Furthermore, abnormal expression patterns of T3-target genes in TR betaPV mice were altered by the lack of TR alpha1. These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice. Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH. This compensatory role may be especially crucial for postnatal growth.
