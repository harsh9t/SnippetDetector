Androgenic alopecia (AGA), or pattern hair loss, is a common condition that affects both men and women has been gradually increasing. The discovery of the androgen receptor (AR) gene and related genes has expanded the knowledge on the genetics of hair loss. These basic science studies, combined with more recent clinical studies, have led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AGA in both men and women. These genetic advances have also led to the development of a new screening test for AGA. Recently, in addition to the two currently approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medications (minoxidil and finasteride), a novel device was FDA-approved for the treatment of hair loss, the laser hair comb. Further studies are needed to verify the accuracy and validity of the genetic screening test and the efficacy of the laser hair comb.
