PURPOSE: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or male pattern hair loss, affects up to 96% of Caucasian men. Characterized by gradual thinning and eventual loss of hair along frontotemporal, parietal, and vertex areas of the scalp, AGA is associated with low self-esteem, depression, and dissatisfaction with body appearance. DATA SOURCES: In this systematic review of the literature, six primary research studies conducted in the United States are evaluated for their clinical application to primary care provider practice. CONCLUSIONS: Topical minoxidil 2%-5% 1 mL twice daily or finasteride 1 mg daily are recommended as first line treatments, followed by the use of Food and Drug Administration-cleared HairMax LaserCombÂ® in patients who do not respond to first line modalities. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Further research in novel and established treatments is recommended, along with an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for practitioners in the United States.
