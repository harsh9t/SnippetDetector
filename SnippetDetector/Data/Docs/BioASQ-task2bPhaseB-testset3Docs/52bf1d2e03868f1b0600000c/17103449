<abstract>
P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities. We report a family with this mutation associated with sudden death in an affected newborn, most probably due to upper airway obstruction.
