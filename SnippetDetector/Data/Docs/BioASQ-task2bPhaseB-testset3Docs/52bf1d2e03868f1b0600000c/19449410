Muenke syndrome (MS), also known as Muenke nonsyndromic coronal craniosynostosis, is an autosomal dominant condition which can be distinguished from the more common forms of acrocephalosyndactyly but presents a significant variable phenotype. We report on a set of identical twins with a de novo C749G mutation in the FGFR3 gene codon 250 after a pregnancy complicated by prenatal exposure to Nortriptyline. These patients illustrate the variable expressivity of MS in association with an identical gene mutation.
