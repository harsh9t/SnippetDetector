Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a known complication after prostate surgery. To date no pharmacologic treatment is available. Currently Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is available for women with SUI. This study investigates the effect of Duloxetine on men with SUI after prostate surgery. 56 patients were included in our study. 49 after radical prostatectomy and 7 after TURP. All patients were initially treated with pelvic floor exercises. Thereafter 40 mg Duloxetine was administered twice daily. When taking Duloxetine, the average use of incontinence pads decreased from 3.3 to 1.5 per day. 14 patients needed no and 18 a single pad per day. Most patients reported mild and temporary side effects, 13 patients assessed them to be moderate and 9 being severe. The results of this off-label use show that Duloxetine is effective in men with SUI after prostate surgery even if standard pelvic floor exercises have failed.
