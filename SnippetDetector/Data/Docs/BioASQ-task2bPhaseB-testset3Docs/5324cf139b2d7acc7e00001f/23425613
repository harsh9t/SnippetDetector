OBJECTIVE: The present analysis evaluates the prevalence and medication use in inpatients with depression during childhood and adolescence at the KinderAGATE hospitals in 2010. Also discussed are age and sex distribution. METHOD: Since 2009 the following information has been recorded anonymously twice a year from each patient at the participating hospitals of KinderAGATE: age, sex, leading diagnosis, prescribed medication and dosage. The data obtained provide an excellent epidemiological basis for the observation of the prescription practice in child and adolescent psychiatry. RESULTS: In 2010, 8.4 % of the patients included were treated for a depressive disorder at the KinderAGATE hospitals. This is only a small portion compared to the rates found in adult psychiatry (25.8 % of patients). In our sample male patients diagnosed with depression (58 % DPat, mean age 13.8 years) were treated more often and earlier than female patients (42 % DPat, mean age 15.3 years). Fluoxetine and mirtazapine were the most frequently prescribed substances. Sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram were also prescribed. CONCLUSION: A reserved medical treatment can be observed in child and adolescence psychiatry. Off-label use seems to be nearly unavoidable due to the lack of newly authorized medicine. Moreover, the numerous prescriptions for fluoxetine, the only SSRI currently approved for this age group in Germany, lead to the question of possible unauthorized alternatives.
