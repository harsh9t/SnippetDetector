OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to determine the prevalence and patterns of antidepressants prescription in outpatient setting in Croatia. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of outpatient visits to child psychiatrists by persons aged 18 and younger that included prescription of antidepressants during the year 2010. Antidepressant prescription data were identified by medication class, drug entity and were analyzed in relation to age group, gender, psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS: Antidepressants were prescribed to 139 youths (0.24â€°), significantly more to adolescents than pre-adolescents and for the treatment of depressive disorders in females, and mixed disorders of emotions and conduct in males. Sertraline was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder, followed by fluvoxamine and tianeptine. Fluvoxamine was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of anxiety disorders and mixed disorders of emotions and conduct. Off-label prescribing of antidepressants was found in 85.6% of young patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study found considerably lower prevalence and higher off-label rate of antidepressant prescriptions to young people in Croatia to that in other European Countries and in the United States. Selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors comprise most of the antidepressant medications prescribed to young people, reflecting trends in the developed countries.
