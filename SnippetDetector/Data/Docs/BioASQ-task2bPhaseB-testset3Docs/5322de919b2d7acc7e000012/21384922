Submandibular gland autotransplantation is effective for treating severe dry eye syndrome. However, more than 40% of patients show epiphora within 3-6 months after treatment. The mechanism underlying the hypersecretion in epiphora remains to be elucidated for developing novel interventions. Since salivary gland secretion is dependent on a variety of proteins, we analyzed the changes in protein expression in transplanted glands of epiphora patients with 2-D gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and evaluated their possible roles in epiphora. There were 23 proteins that showed altered expression in the glands of epiphora patients, 15 being up-expressed and 8 being down-expressed. The expression of secretory proteins was decreased in these glands, including alpha-amylase, cystatin S, SA, and SN. In contrast, cytoskeletal proteins were all up-regulated, including actin and vimentin. Immunofluorescence revealed that the intensity ratio of F-actin in apical and lateral cytoplasm to total F-actin in acini was decreased in the glands of epiphora patients. Carbachol stimulation induced a similar redistribution of F-actin in the control glands. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was increased in both carbachol-stimulated and epiphora glands. Preincubation of submandibular glands with ERK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 inhibited carbachol-induced F-actin redistribution. These results indicated that differentially expressed proteins participated in the hypersecretion of transplanted submandibular glands and the redistribution of F-actin might be involved in this hypersecretion in an ERK1/2-dependent manner.
