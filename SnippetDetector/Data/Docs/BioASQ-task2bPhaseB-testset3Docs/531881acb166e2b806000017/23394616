UNLABELLED:  BACKGROUND: Geldanamycin (GA) can be considered a relatively new component with a promising mode of action against human malignancies. It specifically targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone. METHODS: In this study, we have investigated the effects of geldanamycin on the regulation of Hsp90-dependent oncogenic signaling pathways directly implicated in cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human urinary bladder cancer cells. In order to assess the biological outcome of Hsp90 inhibition on RT4 (grade I) and T24 (grade III) human urinary bladder cancer cell lines, we applied MTT assay, FACS analysis, Western blotting, semi-quantitative (sq) RT-PCR, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), immunofluorescence and scratch-wound assay. RESULTS: We have herein demonstrated that, upon geldanamycin treatment, bladder cancer cells are prominently arrested in the G1 phase of cell cycle and eventually undergo programmed cell death via combined activation of apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, geldanamycin administration proved to induce prominent downregulation of several Hsp90 protein clients and downstream effectors, such as membrane receptors (IGF-IR and c-Met), protein kinases (Akt, IKKα, IKKβ and Erk1/2) and transcription factors (FOXOs and NF-κΒ), therefore resulting in the impairment of proliferative -oncogenic- signaling and reduction of cell motility. CONCLUSIONS: In toto, we have evinced the dose-dependent and cell line-specific actions of geldanamycin on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of critical Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling -oncogenic- integrity.

Background
eat shock protein 90 (sp90) is an abundant intracellular protein that has emerged as a significant target of modern cancer therapeutic protocols. sp90 normally accounts for ~1-2% of the total protein content of the cell, while under stress conditions its levels increase up to ~4-6% of the whole cytosolic proteomic load
[1-3]. sp90 chaperone activity depends on its transient dimerization, which stimulates the essential, intrinsic ase function. he sp90 chaperone complex maintains the correct conformational folding, functional integrity and proteolytic turnover of a broad range of protein clients that are implicated in various signal transduction pathways controlling, among others, cell survival and proliferation
[2,4]. oreover, a number of oncogenic proteins critically depend on the sp90 molecular chaperone to obtain an active conformation and a functional capacity. sp90 upregulation in several malignancies and solid tumors unveils a likely β€�protectiveβ€� role of the chaperone in tumorigenesis, serving as a β€�biochemical bufferβ€�
[5]. sp90 represents an indispensable part of a complicated machinery called β€�chaperosomeβ€� that allows cancer cells to escape normal regulation and function. ence, cancer initiation, tumor progression and its clonal evolution are associated with a requirement for increased intracellular levels of sp90
[6-8]. herefore, due to cancer cell dependence upon specific -oncogenic- sp90 protein clients, sp90 inhibition is thought to negatively interfere with critical oncogenic signaling pathways involved in the hallmark traits of cancer (i.e. sustaining cell proliferation, resisting cell death, and promoting invasion and metastasis)

Urinary bladder cancer ranks second in frequency among malignancies of the genitourinary tract and is the fifth most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous neoplasm of the industrialized world, accounting for more than 4% of all types of cancer worldwide
[11-13]. A significant percentage of bladder cancer patients (~70-80%) initially present with highly differentiated, non-invasive papillary tumors, whereas the rest (~20-30%) develop an aggressive muscle-invasive tumor of low differentiation.

Geldanamycin proved the first natural product carrying Hsp90 inhibitory properties that was able to critically interfere with a complex network of oncogenic signaling pathways regulating survival, proliferation and motility of the two -representative for the disease- human urinary bladder cancer cell lines, of diverse malignancy grade and p53 genetic content, RT4 (grade I; wild-type p53) and T24 (grade III; mutant p53).

Results and discussion
eldanamycin inhibits cell cycle progression of human urinary bladder cancer cells. We have studied the effect of 24-hour geldanamycin treatment on the progression of the cell cycle of RT4 and T24 human urinary bladder cancer cells by the use of flow cytometry (FigureΒ 
1A). RT4 presented with a dose-dependent G1 arrest (from 62.5% in the control to 80.6% at 10Β ΞΌM), while T24 cells displayed a similar pattern of cytostatic effect, with the percentage of G1-trapped cells rising to 85.9% (from 74.2% in the control) at the concentration of 1Β ΞΌM geldanamycin. T24 cells also proved to obtain a mild G2-block (13% in the control to 17.2% at the dose of 10 ΞΌΞ�). In order to mechanistically illuminate the G1-arrest observed, we examined the effect of geldanamycin on several modulators of the cell cycle, such as Cyclin/Cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) complex proteins (FigureΒ 
1B) and downstream cell progression effectors, such as pRb (retinoblastoma protein) and the transcription factor E2F1 (FigureΒ 
1C). As shown in FigureΒ 
1B (upper panel; image and graph), Cdk4 protein levels follow a cell line-specific response to increasing concentrations of geldanamycin, with RT4 exhibiting a dose-dependent decrease of Cdk4 expression levels up to the dose of 0.1 ΞΌΞ� that is followed by a subsequent rise of protein levels at the highest concentrations (1 and 10Β ΞΌM), therefore disrupting the downregulation pattern. In contrast, the highly malignant T24 cells presented with a moderate and dose-dependent downregulation profile of Cdk4 levels in response to the drug. The study of the expression levels of Cyclin D1 mRNA revealed a similar pattern of dose-dependent downregulation in both drug-treated cell lines (FigureΒ 
1B {lower panel; image and graph}), likely indicating the Cyclin/Cdk complex implication in the geldanamycin-induced G1 cell cycle arrest. As shown in FigureΒ 
1C (image and graphs), the expression levels and activity status of the critical cell cycle regulators pRb and E2F1 were also analyzed through Western blotting. RT4 presented with a slight increase of -total- pRb protein levels up to the concentration of 1Β ΞΌM geldanamycin, whereas T24 cells exhibited a notable reduction of its expression (the lower band of 106Β kDa) in a dose-dependent manner. The differentiated RT4 cells do not carry any (multi-)phosphorylated pRb form(s), while malignant T24 cells are characterized by the presence of a constitutively (multi-)phosphorylated pRb protein form (the upper band of 110Β kDa)
[20], which follows a dose-dependent downregulation in response to geldanamycin exposure. Furthermore, E2F1 protein expression levels displayed a prominent downregulation in both drug-treated cell lines, rendering the transcription factor almost undetectable at the higher dose of 10 ΞΌΞ� and therefore suggesting its critical implication in the geldanamycin-induced G1-block described here. Hsp90 inhibition is known to facilitate cell cycle arrest in all checkpoints of the cell cycle, depending on malignancy grade and cellular context
[21]. In the bladder cancer cell lines examined in the present study, geldanamycin administration primarily leads to a dose-dependent G1-checkpoint cell cycle arrest, while analysis of expression and activation profiles of several determinants of the cell cycle (Cdk4, pRb, Cyclin D1 and E2F1) correlate well with the observed block in cycle progression. Furthermore, the geldanamycin-induced E2F1 strong downregulation profile demonstrated herein is a novel and interesting finding. The molecular mechanism underlying E2F1 protein downregulation upon Hsp90 inhibition (i.e. transcriptional suppression, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and autophagic cell death) is still elusive and remains to be further explored. To conclude, Hsp90 inhibition due to geldanamycin administration proved to induce a severe reduction in the expression dynamics of several bona fide Hsp90 protein clients involved in cell cycle progression (concurring with chaperonesβ€™ ability to regulate cell cycle
[22]), subsequently diminishing bladder cancer cell proliferation potential.Figure 1Reduction of bladder cancer cell cycle activity in response to geldanamycin.

Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value.Geldanamycin manifests a cytotoxic effect on human bladder cancer cellsTo study the biological effect of geldanamycin on bladder cancer cell survival, we performed MTT assays on RT4 and T24 cells, after their exposure to 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10Β ΞΌM of the drug for 24 and 48Β hours. Both cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability, as illustrated in FigureΒ 
2. Survival levels at the highest concentration of geldanamycin (10Β ΞΌM) were measured as 71 and 61% for the 24-hour treatment of RT4 and T24 cells, respectively. T24 cells presented with higher sensitivity to the cytotoxic activity of geldanamycin after 24Β hours of treatment, compared to RT4 cells, therefore revealing the likely targeted capacity of the drug on cells with comparatively higher malignancy grade. Cell viability showed a stronger decrease for both cell lines after 48 (compared to 24) hours of geldanamycin exposure, as cell survival proved not to exceed the 62% ratio for differentiated RT4 cells and the 46% one for malignant T24 cells at the drug dose of 10 ΞΌΞ�. Cells measured alive at 24Β hours, albeit already committed to apoptosis, appeared to die after 48Β hours of drug treatment. Hence, the percentage of cell survival is significantly reduced in both bladder cancer cell lines, with T24 cells being comparatively more vulnerable to the cytotoxic potency of gelanamycin. Activation of programmed cell death is the prevailing response of cells against chemotherapeutic agents. Survival rates obtained in this study directly reflect the cytotoxic and likely apoptotic (see below) function of geldanamycin-induced Hsp90 inhibition in RT4 and T24 cells, following a cell line-specific mode of action. T24 cells proved to respond better to the treatment, demonstrating comparatively lower resistance to the drug and therefore indicating geldanamycinβ€™s targeted cytotoxic efficacy against highly malignant urothelial cells.Figure 2Geldanamycin-induced cytotoxicity. MTT toxicity assays were performed in RT4 and T24 cells after 24- (left) and 48-hour (right) treatment with increasing concentrations of geldanamycin. All assays were carried out three times. Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value, while asterisks denote statistical significance of the observed averaged differences. P < 0.05 .Geldanamycin induces activation of cell death programs in bladder cancer cellsGeldanamycin-induced reduction of cell survival was further investigated through a Western blotting approach and it proved to be strongly associated with proteolytic cleavage and activation of critical members of the caspase family, as shown in FigureΒ 
3. The downregulation profiles of precursor caspase protein expression levels, specifically evinced in RT4 cells, together with dose-dependent and cell line-specific increase of proteolytic cleavage product levels of the two initiator caspases (caspase-8 and caspase-9) and the executioner caspase-3, clearly demonstrate the ability of geldanamycin to induce apoptotic cell death via caspase-cascade activation in the bladder cancer cell lines examined. Apoptotic cell death was further certified by the detection of proteolytic processing of the caspase-repertoire substrates PARP and Lamin A/C upon administration of relatively high concentrations of geldanamycin (1 and 10 ΞΌΞ�). The drug-induced cleaved fragments of PARP (89Β kDa) and Lamin A/C (28Β kDa) are characteristic markers of caspase-dependent apoptotic death, thus indicating the ability of geldanamycin to drive bladder cancer cells to apoptosis. However, it proved that T24 are more resistant to drug-induced apoptosis than RT4 cells, as clearly documented by the comparison of the obtained proteolytic profiles of the apoptotic regulators examined. The inconsistency between cell survival rates and caspase repertoire activation in drug-exposed T24 (compared to RT4) bladder cancer cells led us to examine the presumable implication of alternative and caspase-independent cell death programs that could tightly regulate the strong reduction of cell proliferation and survival in the T24 cell line in response to geldanamycin administration.Figure 3Caspase-dependent activation of programmed cell death. Expression and proteolytic processing patterns of apoptosis-related critical proteins in response to 24Β hours of geldanamycin treatment in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells. Western blottings of members of the caspase signaling cascade (caspase-8, -9 and β�’3) and the caspase repertoire substrates PARP and Lamin A/C are shown. Actin has been used as protein of reference. Data are obtained from three different experimental trials, one of which is presented here.FigureΒ 
4 illustrates that RT4 and T24 cells can demonstrate significant levels of lysosomal activity upon 24-hour geldanamycin treatment, as clearly evinced by their incubation with an autophagy-specific cell dye (Lysotracker Red) and the suitable application of confocal microscopy technology. Therefore, it seems that lysosome-mediated autophagy critically contributes to the significant reduction of RT4 and T24 cell survival in response to Hsp90 inhibition. Although apoptosis is considered the dominant mechanism of programmed cell death upon drug administration
[20,23], autophagy seems to come into play rather frequently when certain type of stress is applied
[24,25]. As documented here, Hsp90 inhibition proves to awake the internal programmed cell death machineries, resulting in the engagement of distinct death cascades that likely operate in a cell line-specific fashion. This mainly occurs due to geldanamycin-induced caspase-3 activation, and its cognate substrates fragmentation, as well as lysosome-orchestrated autophagic cleavage of critical cellular proteins or protein complexes. Conclusively, we have established the simultaneous activation of apoptosis and autophagy that proved to decisively contribute to (bladder cancer) cell line-specific cytotoxicity of geldanamycin, unveiling drugβ€™s strong efficacy to successfully eradicate urothelial cells of high malignancy.Figure 4Autophagy-mediated programmed cell death. Characteristic images of RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cell activation of autophagy in response to 1Β ΞΌM of geldanamycin treatment (scale bars: 10Β ΞΌm). Cells were stained with Lysotracker Red that specifically recognizes active lysosomes (white arrows), therefore allowing the detection of an autophagic cell death program. Images were taken under a Nikon EZ-C1 confocal microscope. All cell staining experiments were conducted three times, while a representative image collection is shown here.Hsp90 impairment due to exposure of human urinary bladder cancer cells to geldanamycinNext, we studied the effect of geldanamycin on the structural and functional integrity of its molecular target; the Hsp90 chaperone. As shown in FigureΒ 
5 (upper image and respective graph), RT4 cells display a dose-dependent downregulation of Hsp90 protein levels up to the concentration of 0.1 ΞΌΞ�. This pattern is disrupted by a following increase of chaperoneβ€™s expression levels that occurs under the actions of the higher concentrations (1 and 10Β ΞΌM) of the drug. The complete restoration of total Hsp90 protein levels was accompanied by the production of a proteolytically cleaved Hsp90 fragment (~65Β kDa) at the highest drug dose. This pattern was not detected in the malignant cell line T24, which displayed a mild and dose-dependent downregulation of Hsp90 levels in response to geldanamycin treatment. This intriguing finding has been reported by our research group in a recent study that revealed a cell line-specific proteolytic cleavage of Hsp90 as a response to 17-AAG, another Hsp90 inhibitor
[20]. However, the experimental data presented herein indicate for a distinct and non-described, so far, inhibitory activity of geldanamycin on Hsp90, which is deployed by its ability to critically reduce Hsp90 cellular contents upon certain stress levels, specifically in an environment of bladder cancer cells of low malignancy grade. Specific conformations of the chaperone have been implicated in the sensitivity of cancer cells to Hsp90 inhibitors, compared to normal cells that seem to be less susceptible to these types of drugs
[26]. In accordance, the prototype compound of the benzoquinone ansamycin group of natural antibiotics, geldanamycin, proves to exert strong impairment activities on the molecular chaperone Hsp90, therefore allowing the therapeutic exploitation of its high binding affinity to predominantly cancerous chaperone complexes.Figure 5Hsp90 harm after exposure of bladder cancer cells to geldanamycin. Western blottings (upper left panel) of critical members of the eukaryotic chaperosome (Hsp90 and Hsp70) after 24-hour geldanamycin administration in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells. A cell line-specific Hsp90 proteolytic processing is observed, as documented by the production of a ~65Β kDa Hsp90-like protein fragment. Detection of Hsp90Ξ± and Hsp90Ξ² mRNA levels via sqRT-PCR (lower left panel), proving the absence of Hsp90 transcriptional regulation in response to the drug. Right panel: protein (top and middle) and RNA transcript (bottom) densitometric quantification bars, denoting the drug-induced alterations of Hsp90/Hsp70/Ξ±-Tubulin and Hsp90Ξ±/Hsp90Ξ² expression levels compared to control conditions, using Actin (upper left panel) and GAPDH (lower left panel) as protein and gene of reference, respectively. Western blotting and sqRT-PCR experiments were executed three times, with a respective characteristic image collection presented here. Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value.The protein levels of the co-chaperone Hsp70 exhibited a dose-dependent increase in both drug-treated cell lines, while the production of an additional proteolytically cleaved product at the -mainly- higher doses of the drug (1 and 10Β ΞΌM for RT4 cells; 0.1, 1 and 10Β ΞΌM for T24 cells) was also observed (FigureΒ 
5 {upper image and respective graph}). Interestingly, the molecular weight of Hsp70 proteolytic fragment was calculated at approximately 65Β kDa, similar to the one measured for Hsp90 cleaved product. Hsp90 and Hsp70 fragmentation has been previously reported in response to diverse types of stress
[20,27] and seems to correlate well with Granzyme-B-mediated proteolytic processing of the chaperosome. The cell line-specific products of ~65Β kDa could likely act as putative dominant negative components, able to induce a functional amputation of each molecular chaperone, respectively. Geldanamycin-mediated inhibition of Hsp90 also leads to similar -to Hsp90- protein expression profiles of molecules that are in direct structural and functional association with the molecular chaperone, such as the cytoskeleton component Ξ±-tubulin (FigureΒ 
5 {upper image and respective graph}). In order to mechanistically dissect the intriguing and fluctuation-type pattern of Hsp90 protein expression in response to increasing concentrations of geldanamycin, we, next, examined the transcriptional expression profiles of Hsp90Ξ± and Ξ—sp90Ξ² cognate genes upon geldanamycin administration. Hsp90 (Ξ± and Ξ²) mRNA transcript levels proved to remain unaffected in both drug-exposed RT4 and T24 cells (FigureΒ 
5 {lower image and respective graphs}), thus excluding any type of transcriptional regulation mechanism in the geldanamycin-induced impairment of Hsp90 structural and functional integrity, in a tumorigenic urothelial environment.Exposure to geldanamycin leads to disruption of cell signaling activityStructural and functional inhibition of Hp90 due to geldanamycin administration leads to severe downregulation of critical protein clients of the molecular chaperone in human urinary bladder cancer cells, as shown in FigureΒ 
6A. In response to increasing doses of geldanamycin, essential protein components of the IGF-IR/Akt/NF-ΞΊB signaling axis displayed prominent dose-dependent reduction of their expression levels. Total protein levels of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) presented with significant dose-dependent decrease in both bladder cancer cell lines, with T24 cells being more vulnerable to the drug. Interestingly, even though the phosphorylated IGF-IR form in T24 cells was similarly downregulated in a dose-dependent manner, RT4 cells showed no phosphorylation of the receptor, likely unmasking their low malignancy grade character (FigureΒ 
6A {image} and 6B {respective graphs}). A key molecule in many signaling pathways and prominent member of the Hsp90 clientele is the Akt serine/threonine kinase. Upon administration of geldanamycin, Akt total protein levels presented with a dose-dependent and cell line-specific pattern of strong downregulation, with RT4 cells exhibiting a more notable decrease, resulting in a severe eradication of the Akt kinase at the highest drug concentration (10Β ΞΌM). T24 cells proved to contain a constitutively phosphorylated Akt kinase form (on a critical serine residue at position 473), whose expression levels appeared to follow a dose-dependent and strong downregulation in response to geldanamycin administration. In contrast, and according to their low malignancy grade, RT4 cells did not show any basal phosphorylation of the Akt kinase (FigureΒ 
6A {image} and 6B {respective graphs}). The drug-induced severe degradation of Akt protein was further investigated by immunofluorescence experiments. As shown in FigureΒ 
6C, Akt (green color) presented with a prominent reduction of the number of β€�fociβ€� that reflected proteinβ€™s cellular topology, upon 24-hour drug administration (10 ΞΌΞ�) in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells. Geldanamycin-induced Akt degradation proved to also deplete the Hsp90 chaperosome (red color), with a putative physical interaction between Hsp90 and Akt proteins being primarily revealed under control conditions (absence of drug), where the chaperone and its kinase client seemed to share common subcellular localization, as it was mainly demonstrated by the bright orange colored-pattern (white arrows).Figure 6Oncogenic signal transduction downregulation (I). Geldanamycin-induced Hsp90 inhibition results in functional impairment of Akt-dependent signaling in human urinary bladder cancer cells. (A) Western blotting experiments reveal drastic downregulation of Akt signaling activity, evolving through the IGF-IR/Akt/IKK signal transduction axis, as evidenced by the eradication of both total and constitutively phosphorylated protein forms of all examined Hsp90 protein clients (IGF-IR, Akt, IKKΞ± and IKKΞ²), in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cell lines. Actin was used as protein of reference. All Western blottings were carried out three times, with a representative image collection shown here. (B) Protein densitometric quantification bars, denoting the drug-induced expression level alterations of the IGF-IR/Akt/IKK signaling axis components, and their respective phosphorylated forms, compared to control conditions, using Actin (A) as protein of reference. Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value. (C) Immunofluorescence images illustrating the cellular localization of Hsp90 (red color) and Akt kinase (green color) in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells, in the presence or absence of geldanamycin. Upon drug administration (10 ΞΌΞ�), a pronounced depletion of cytoplasmic Akt protein is detected, in contrast to what is observed under control conditions. The bright orange color (white arrows) indicates the cellular areas where Akt and Hsp90 are likely co-localized (associated), in the absence of drug conditions. Images were taken under a Nikon EZ-C1 confocal microscope. All immunofluorescence experiments were conducted three times, while a characteristic image collection is presented here (scale bars: 10Β ΞΌm).Geldanamycin-induced Akt downregulation was accompanied by degradation of its direct downstream targets and bona fide Hsp90 protein clients IKKΞ± and IKKΞ². Both IKK serine/threonine kinases presented with a dose-dependent pattern of total protein downregulation in both drug-exposed cell lines, with RT4 cells exhibiting a more severe reduction of expression levels, under the effect of increasing drug concentrations. Constitutively active Ξ™Ξ�Ξ�Ξ± and Ξ™Ξ�Ξ�Ξ² kinases (phosphorylation on the critical serine residue 180 and 181, respectively) were detected in both RT4 and T24 cell lines and proved to follow a moderate dose-dependent reduction of signaling capacity in response to geldanamycin administration (FigureΒ 
6A {image} and
6B {respective graphs}). Conclusively, it seems that geldanamycin-mediated inhibition of Hsp90 leads to multiple structural truncations and functional amputations of critical molecules that constitute and modulate the IGF-IR/Akt/IKK signaling axis, thus rendering its signal transduction power severely compromised.In order to further dissect this β€�pharmaco-signalingβ€� pathway, we examined the effect of geldanamycin-induced Hsp90 inhibition on the endmost downstream target of IGF-IR/Akt/IKK signaling cascade, the NF-ΞΊB transcription factor. As shown in FigureΒ 
7A, geldanamycin forces the relocation of NF-ΞΊB from cell nucleus to cytoplasm, thus restraining its -constitutive- transcriptional activity, mainly due to its drug-mediated sequestration into the cytoplasm. As evidenced by Western blotting, cytoplasmic protein extracts displayed a dose-dependent increase of NF-ΞΊB expression levels in both drug-treated cell lines, while nuclear extracts presented with a complete depletion of the transcription factor under the actions of increasing doses of the drug, with T24 being relatively more resistant than RT4 cells (FigureΒ 
7A {image and respective graphs}). To reinforce the biological significance of geldanamycin-induced NF-ΞΊB inactivation observed, we performed EMSA assays, using RT4 and T24 nuclear extracts, and found that the sequestration of NF-ΞΊB into the cytoplasm was tightly associated with its dose-specific inability to recognize and bind onto its 5Β΄ -biotin labeled oligonucleotide target sequence, in response to geldanamycin (FigureΒ 
7B). Next, we also attempted to rather more directly assess the drug-induced damage of NF-ΞΊB transcriptional activity, by examining the mRNA expression profiles -through sqRT-PCR- of several bona fide NF-ΞΊB target genes (i.e. Survivin, cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP) after exposure of RT4 and T24 cells to geldanamycin. As presented in FigureΒ 
7C (image and respective graphs), all four genes displayed cell line-specific and dose-dependent downregulation profiles upon drug exposure, with cIAP-2 showing the strongest effect. The transcriptional repression of this group of anti-apoptotic genes strongly reflects the severe disruption of critical signaling pathways due to geldanamycin administration, therefore contributing to the anti-neoplastic and anti-proliferative capacity of Hsp90 inhibition on bladder cancer cells. IGF-IR/Akt/NF-ΞΊB signaling axis deregulation plays an essential role in cancer cell survival, tumor proliferation and migration
[20,28,29]. Conclusively, it seems that geldanamycin administration drastically compromises intracellular signaling of neoplastic urothelial cells due to targeted kinase degradation, ultimately resulting in the transcriptional repression of several anti-apoptotic genes upon NF-ΞΊΞ’ sequestration into the cytoplasm, as previously suggested for a β€�chemoradiotherapyβ€� type of applied stress
[28]. This multi-combinatorial β€�attackβ€� of the drug to cancer cell signaling and transcriptional networks directly reflects the strong therapeutic potential of Hsp90 inhibition in human bladder cancer and unmasks geldanamycinβ€™s anti-tumorigenic properties.Figure 7NF-ΞΊΞ’ inactivation after exposure of human bladder cancer cells to geldanamycin. NF-ΞΊB transcriptional capacity is diminished upon 24-hour geldanamycin administration in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells. (A) Upper panel: Western blottings displaying NF-ΞΊB protein expression levels and compartmentalization responses to drug treatment in both cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts of RT4 and T24 cells. Protein sample quantification of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was evaluated using Actin and Lamin A/C as respective (compartment-specific) reference markers, while the absence of detectable NF-ΞΊB in nuclear extracts derived from drug-treated cells ensured samplesβ€™ purity. Lower panel: cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-ΞΊB densitometric quantification bars, denoting its drug-induced compartmentalization change compared to control conditions, using Actin and Lamin A/C as respective proteins of reference. Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value. Experiments were carried out three times, while characteristic Western blotting results are presented here. (B) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) conducted on RT4 and T24 nuclear protein extracts. Binding assays were performed using NF-ΞΊB-specific and 5Β΄ -biotin labeled, double-stranded (annealed), oligonucleotides. EMSA experiments were repeated three times, one of which is shown here. (C) Left panel: transcriptional expression profiles of four critical anti-apoptotic NF-ΞΊB target genes (Survivin, cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP), in response to 24-hour geldanamycin administration, in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells. Right panel: RNA transcript densitometric quantification bars, denoting the drug-induced expression level alterations of the NF-ΞΊB target genes examined, compared to control conditions, using GAPDH (left panel) as gene of reference. All sqRT-PCR reactions were carried out three times, while a characteristic assembled profiling is presented here. Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value.In an effort to further assess the combinatorial action of Hsp90 inhibition on critical signal transduction cascades with known cross-talk functions between each other, we studied the effect of geldanamycin-induced Hsp90 inhibition on the Akt downstream signaling targets FOXO transcription factors and p44/42 MAP (Erk1/2) kinases, which are tightly associated with the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. As shown in FigureΒ 
8 (image and respective graphs), in contrast to RT4, T24 cells were characterized by constitutively phosphorylated FOXO1 and FOXO3 proteins that displayed dose-dependent downregulation profiles in response to geldanamycin. Therefore, a dephosphorylation-mediated nuclear sequestration of FOXO factors seems to represent a predominant response to the drug that results in the following trans-activation of certain apoptotic target genes, therefore reinforcing the generation of an apoptotic phenotype. Next, we examined the effect of geldanamycin-induced Hsp90 inhibition on the MAP kinase signaling cascade, through the detection of total and phosphorylated protein levels of p44 and p42 serine/threonine MAP kinases, using the Western blotting technology. As evinced in FigureΒ 
8 (image and respective graph), total protein levels of p44/42 kinases in RT4 cells presented with a drug response pattern similar to the ones described above for Hsp90, Cdk4 and Ξ±-tubulin proteins. In T24 cells, p44/42 total proteins were moderately downregulated in a dose-dependent manner in response to geldanamycin. Moreover, we analyzed the signaling capacity of p44/42 kinases through detection of the active (phosphorylated on the critical residue threonine 202 and tyrosine 204, respectively) proteins in the presence or absence of the drug. FigureΒ 
8 (image and respective graph) reveals that both RT4 and T24 cells present with constitutively active (phosphorylated) forms of p44/42 proteins, which undergo dose-specific inactivation after exposure to geldanamycin, with T24 cells being comparatively more sensitive to the higher drug doses. MAP kinase signaling attenuation and damage likely result in downregulation and deactivation of several downstream targets critically implicated in cell survival and proliferation, thus rendering bladder cancer cells susceptible to the cytotoxic power of geldanamycin. Functional deregulation of FOXO- and p44/42-dependent signaling pathways is critical to tumor survival and growth, while their inhibition is known to contribute to the production of an apoptotic phenotype
[30]. It seems that geldanamycin in human urinary bladder cancer cells causes a strong suppression of pivotal tumorigenic signaling networks, therefore inducing activation of apoptosis and contributing to obliteration of malignant characteristics.Figure 8Oncogenic signal transduction downregulation (II). Left panel: Western blotting experiments presenting protein expression levels of total and constitutively phosphorylated FOXO transcription factors and p44/42 MAP kinases, in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells, upon geldanamycin administration for 24Β hours. Right panel: protein densitometric quantification bars, denoting the drug-induced expression level alterations of the FOXO and MAPK family members examined, and their respective phosphorylated forms, compared to control conditions, using Actin (left panel) as protein of reference. All experiments were repeated three times, with a typically obtained image collection shown here. Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value.Geldanamycin administration results in impaired bladder cancer cell motilityCancer cell motility is one of the β€�hallmark traitsβ€� of the neoplastic phenotype and plays an important role in the process of tumor cell invasion and tissue infiltration. c-Met, also known as the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, is a key signaling component in tumor proliferation, cancer cell motility and invasion
[31]. In this context, we studied the effect of geldanamycin on c-Met signaling and cancer cell motility via Western blotting and scratch-wound assay, respectively. As shown in FigureΒ 
9A (image and respective graphs), constitutively phosphorylated (on critical tyrosine residues at positions 1234 and 1235) and total c-Met protein levels were detected only in the aggressive and highly malignant T24 cells, and not in the low malignancy grade RT4 cells. Both -constitutively- active and total c-Met protein contents in T24 cells proved to follow dose-dependent downregulation profiles in response to geldanamycin administration, thus indicating the suppressive effect of Hsp90 inhibition on bladder cancer cell motility and invasion dynamics.Figure 9Impairment of bladder cancer cell motility and invasion mechanisms. (A) Top panel: total and phosphorylated protein expression levels of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), upon 24-hour incubation of RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells with increasing doses of geldanamycin, as shown by Western blotting. Bottom panel: protein densitometric quantification bars, denoting the drug-induced downregulation of total and phosphorylated c-Met expression levels, compared to control conditions, using Actin (top panel) as protein of reference. All Western blottings were performed three times, with a characteristic image collection presented here. Standard deviation values are depicted as error bars on top of each value. (B) Scratch-wound assays were carried out in RT4 and T24 bladder cancer cells under control conditions or treatment with 10Β ΞΌM of geldanamycin for 24Β hours. Observations were made under an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert 25) and pictures were taken at 20x magnification. All assays were repeated three times, while a representative image collection is shown here.To further confirm the ability of drug-induced signaling decay to abrogate cancer invasion, we attempted to morphologically visualize the confinement of malignant cell motility through scratch-wound assays. As presented in FigureΒ 
9B, RT4 and T24 cells failed to successfully β€�healβ€� a -mechanically- created gap in their cell monolayer surface during a 24-hour period of geldanamycin (10Β ΞΌM) exposure, whereas under control conditions (absence of the drug) the wound was completely β€�healedβ€� (forming an uninterrupted monolayer) in T24 and weakly β€�fixedβ€� in RT4 cells on the assay surface of Petri dish. The geldanamycin-induced c-Met signaling attenuation reported here accords with previous observations in different cellular environments
[32], strongly evidencing the severe damage in cell proliferation and motility processes of urinary bladder cancer cells growing under the baneful actions of this naturally derived and prototype Hsp90 inhibitor, the geldanamycin.

Conclusions
n this study, we have demonstrated the anti-neoplastic properties of the benzoquinone antibiotic geldanamycin in human urinary bladder cancer cell lines of different malignancy grade. he obtained results proved the dose-dependent and prominent elimination of β€�hallmark traitsβ€� of cancer in both 4 and 24 cells upon geldanamycin-induced inhibition of sp90 molecular chaperone (igure. Β 
10). Drug-mediated downregulation of multiple Hsp90 protein clients in bladder cancer cellular environments resulted in cell cycle arrest, disruption of tumorigenic signal transduction integrity, and impairment of cell motility and invasion mechanisms, whereas cell death programs in the form of apoptosis and autophagy were strongly activated in response to geldanamycin. Pre-clinical in vivo studies have reported side effects of systemic hepatotoxicity
[33], hence limiting the β€�wide-spreadingβ€� utilization of the drug in human malignancies. However, orthotopic administration of -clinically relevant- low doses of geldanamycin into the affected bladder could prove an effective therapeutic approach, initially sensitizing tumors to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) protocols, not only by successfully deploying a combinatorial β€�attackβ€� to multiple oncogenic pathways involved in β€�hallmark traitsβ€� of cancer, but by simultaneously circumventing hepatic toxicity of the drug.
Figure 10Hsp90 inhibition eliminates the β€�hallmark traitsβ€� of cancer. The data presented here clearly demonstrate that the geldanamycin-induced inhibition of Hsp90 results in the combinatorial and multi-step impairment of critical oncogenic pathways likely implicated in the β€�hallmark traitsβ€� of bladder cancer initiation and progression.
