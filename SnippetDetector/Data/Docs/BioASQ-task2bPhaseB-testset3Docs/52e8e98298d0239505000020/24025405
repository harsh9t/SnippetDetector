BACKGROUND: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a lethal, rare hereditary disease with an estimated prevalence of 1:10 000. The genetic variants that cause CPVT are usually highly penetrant. To date, about 189 variants in 5 genes (RYR2, CASQ2, CALM1, TRND, and KCNJ2) have been associated with CPVT pathogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Exome Sequencing Project database (ESP; n=6503) was systematically searched for previously published missense and nonsense CPVT-associated variants reported in several comprehensive reviews and in 2 databases: The Human Gene Mutation Database and The Inherited Arrhythmias Database. We used 4 different prediction tools to assess all missense variants previously associated with CPVT and compared the prediction of protein damage between CPVT-associated variants identified in the ESP and those variants not identified in the ESP. We identified 11% of the variants previously associated with CPVT in the ESP population. In the literature, 57% of these variants were reported as novel disease-causing variants absent in the healthy control subjects. These putative CPVT variants were identified in 41 out of 6131 subjects in the ESP population, corresponding to a prevalence of CPVT of up to 1:150. Using an agreement of ≥3, in silico prediction tools showed a significantly higher frequency of damaging variants among the CPVT-associated variants not identified in the ESP database (83%) compared with those variants identified in the ESP (50%; P=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a substantial overrepresentation of CPVT-associated variants in a large exome database, suggesting that these variants are not necessarily the monogenic cause of CPVT.
