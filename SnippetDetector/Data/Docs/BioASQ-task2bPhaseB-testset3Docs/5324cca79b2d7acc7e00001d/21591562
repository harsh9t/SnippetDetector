More than 17,000 mHealth apps now are available for smart phones and other devices, and they do everything from monitoring urine flow for patients with enlarged prostates to reminding people prone to kidney stones to drink more water. And that's just on the consumer side. Countless apps are avail-able for use by clinicians and hospitals. Mobile apps are changing health care in dramatic ways.
