Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is an autosomal dominant intellectual disability syndrome characterised by unique facial features and congenital anomalies such as Hirschsprung disease, congenital heart defects, corpus callosum agenesis and urinary tract anomalies. Some cases also present epilepsy, growth retardation and microcephaly. The syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of the ZEB2 gene at chromosome 2q22-q23. MWS was first described in 1998 and until now approximately 180 cases have been reported worldwide. We report the first three molecularly confirmed Danish cases with MWS.
