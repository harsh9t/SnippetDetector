Variations in major thyroid hormone transport proteins may be inherited or acquired and may be associated with changes in serum concentration of the proteins or their affinity for thyroid hormones. These variations most frequently involve thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), but changes in transthyretin and albumin are also observed. The consequent alteration of thyroid hormone-binding capacity in serum is associated with variations in total thyroid hormone concentration. Increased serum total thyroid hormone levels are found in subjects with TBG excess, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and transthyretin-associated hyperthyroxinemia. Conversely, diminished serum thyroid hormone values are observed in subjects with TBG deficiency, and decreased concentration or affinity of transthyretin and albumin is not associated with variations in serum concentrations of thyroid hormones. The transport protein-associated variations in serum total thyroid hormone concentrations do not reflect a change in thyroid status. Euthyroidism can be easily established in subjects with transport protein abnormalities by the normal free thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations. It is, however, crucial to select methods for free thyroid hormone measurement that are not affected by abnormalities of transport proteins. Some assays, such as the analog method, often provide artifactual and misleading results, which may lead to inappropriate and even detrimental treatments. The evolutionary advantage of TBG (and albumin) in terms of thyroid homeostasis still remains to be elucidated.
