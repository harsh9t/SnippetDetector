Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome characterized by reduced tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone. Subjects have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels in association with a nonsuppressed TSH. Goiter and thyroid test abnormalities have most often led to further investigation, underscoring the paucity of specific clinical manifestations of RTH. Hypothyroidism has been considered when growth or mental retardation was the presenting symptom and thyrotoxicosis when dealing with attention deficit or hyperactivity. Failure to recognize the inappropriate persistence of TSH secretion, in spite of elevated thyroid hormone levels, has commonly resulted in erroneous diagnosis leading to treatment aimed to normalize the thyroid hormone level. More than 400 subjects with this syndrome have been identified. The mode of inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant in the majority of families. It has long been suspected that RTH is most likely caused by an abnormal thyroid hormone receptor (TR), but this hypothesis could not be directly tested until the isolation of two TR genes, TR alpha and TR beta, located in chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively. TR beta gene mutations have been recently identified in 68 families with RTH. All mutations are located in the T3-binding domain, straddling the putative TR-dimerization region. Mutant TRs exhibit hormone-binding impairment, the degree of which does not correlate with the severity of clinical manifestations. This finding, and the fact that heterozygous subjects with complete TR deletion are not affected, while those with point mutations are, indicated that interactions of the mutant TRs with normal TRs and with other factors, are responsible for the dominant inheritance of RTH and its clinical heterogeneity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
