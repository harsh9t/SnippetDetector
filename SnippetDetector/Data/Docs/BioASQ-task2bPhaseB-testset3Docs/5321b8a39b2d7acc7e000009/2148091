Changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and albumin, and blood hematocrit (Hct) during treadmill exercise were studied in 6 healthy men before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. Plasma ANP levels increased during exercise and then gradually decreased. There was a concomitant increase in both Hct and plasma albumin concentrations. Prior administration of a long-acting propranolol, 160 mg daily for 3 consecutive days, markedly elevated plasma ANP levels before, during and after exercise. In addition, the mean basal Hct increased significantly and further rose during exercise after propranolol administration. When increments in plasma ANP concentrations during exercise in individual subjects were compared with those in Hct, there was a significant positive correlation between the two variables before and after propranolol administration. The results indicate a close relationship between the changes in plasma ANP and those in Hct during exercise at different ANP levels, and suggest that ANP may be at least one of the factors involved in the hemoconcentration associated with exercise.
