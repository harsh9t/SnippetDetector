OBJECTIVE: To study the regulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in obese and lean women with a swelling syndrome. PATIENTS: Thirty-four obese women and 12 lean women with a swelling syndrome and an abnormal isotopic test of capillary permeability to albumin were investigated. MEASUREMENTS: After 10 nocturnal hours of fluid restriction, subjects were asked at 8am to ingest a tap water load of 20 ml/kg within 10 min and to remain strictly recumbent until twelve noon on the first day, and to remain standing and to walk around until twelve noon on the second day. Free water clearance and the cGMP/creatinine and albumin/creatinine ratios were determined hourly in the morning. RESULTS: The total 4 h-urinary volume/ingested water volume ratio was significantly lower on the second day both in the lean and the obese patients, the differences being slightly larger in the obese patients. The increase in free water clearance was significantly less on the second day in the obese patients. The increase in cGMP/creatinine ratio was also significantly lower on the second day in the obese patients. The maximum level of the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly higher on the second day in the obese patients. CONCLUSION: In obese women with a swelling syndrome: (1) The higher increase in the urinary albumin excretion rate after water loading followed by a sustained upright position suggests a widespread alteration in capillary function, which is also indicated by the isotopic test of capillary permeability to albumin. (2) The water load-induced inhibition of ADH secretion and stimulation of ANP secretion or ANP activity, more defective in the upright position than in the recumbent one, is probably another major contributing factor to orthostatic oedema.
