<abstract>
Synthetic human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (102-126) 0.01 microgram/kg per minute or vehicle was intravenously infused for 2 h in 10 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria (albumin excretion, 20 to 200 micrograms/min) and in 10 healthy subjects. In the diabetic group, the immunoglobulin G clearance was higher, but both size index and charge index as calculated from albumin and immunoglobulin clearances were equal compared with normal values. The fractional clearances of small dextrans (< 3.6 nm) were lower in diabetics, which was compatible with a depressed hydraulic permeability (Kf). During ANP infusion, the excretion of albumin and immunoglobulin G increased in the diabetic subjects (189 +/- 12 to 521 +/- 84 and 7.1 +/- 3.5 to 21 +/- 8.1 micrograms/min, respectively; both P < 0.05) only. In the diabetics, the clearance of dextrans > 54 A increased and our calculations indicated an increase in "shut-flow" (omega o). The transcapillary escape rate of albumin, which was elevated in the diabetics at baseline, increased in the diabetic group only. Thus, ANP uncovers altered size selectivity of the filtration barrier in a phase that is otherwise characterized by charge-selective changes only. Moreover, the increased susceptibility of the glomerular capillaries in diabetics to ANP seems to be part of a more generalized capillary abnormality, because ANP also increases the transcapillary escape of albumin.
