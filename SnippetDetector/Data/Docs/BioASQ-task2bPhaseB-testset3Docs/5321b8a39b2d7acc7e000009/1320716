Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone with natriuretic and diuretic effects. To better define the ANP hormonal system in the nephrotic syndrome, a condition associated with renal sodium retention, we undertook a study of glomerular ANP receptors in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and in pair-fed controls. Nephrotic rats had significantly decreased serum albumin and total protein and significantly increased serum cholesterol, triglycerides and 24 hour urinary protein excretion. Plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide was similar in both groups of rats. Competition binding inhibition studies in isolated glomeruli demonstrated one binding site in both groups of rats. The density of ANP binding sites in isolated glomeruli was similar in nephrotic and pair-fed rats while the binding affinity was increased significantly in the nephrotic rats. This is the first study to demonstrate alterations in renal ANP receptors in the nephrotic syndrome. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether alterations in glomerular ANP receptors contribute to renal sodium retention in the nephrotic syndrome.
