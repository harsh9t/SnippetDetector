Indirect systemic and direct oral factor Xa and direct oral factor IIa inhibitors with improved pharmacologic profiles compared with heparins and vitamin K antagonists are currently in clinical development. This overview focuses on the indirect antithrombin dependent pentasaccharide derivatives of idraparinux and on the most advanced oral direct inhibitors to factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and IIa (dabigatran). Specifically, the results of dose-finding studies for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective orthopedic surgery, the results of dose-finding studies for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism including prolonged prophylaxis of recurrent events, and the designs of ongoing clinical trials are reviewed.
