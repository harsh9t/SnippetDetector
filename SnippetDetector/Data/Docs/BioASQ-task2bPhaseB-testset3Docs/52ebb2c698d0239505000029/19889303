We present 2 new cases of cutaneous angiomyolipomas with very similar characteristics, located in the postauricular region of 2 women aged 58 and 52 years. The lesions measured 1.5 cm and 1 cm across and had been present for 5 and 2 years, respectively. Both presented a previously unreported clinical sign: change in size according to the ambient temperature. They had well defined borders and a predominance of smooth muscle and vessels, particularly arteries. In contrast to renal angiomyolipomas, which are often associated with tuberous sclerosis, these angiomyolipomas were negative for melanocytic immunohistochemical markers (human melanoma black-45 antigen and melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1). The clinical characteristics of the 32 cases published until present are reviewed. The relationship of these tumors with angioleiomyomas and renal angiomyolipomas is discussed.
