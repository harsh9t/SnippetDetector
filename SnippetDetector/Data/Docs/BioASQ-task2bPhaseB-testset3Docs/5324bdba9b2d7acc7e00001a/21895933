OBJECTIVE: To identify measurements of ultrasonography (US)-derived bladder wall thickness (BWT) and bladder weight in community-dwelling men with presumably normal bladder function. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 male volunteers underwent transabdominal US measurements of BWT and bladder weight, using the BVM 9500 bladder scanner (Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, USA), at a variety of bladder filling volumes. The data were explored for any correlation between measurements of BWT and US-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) with subject age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ M-LUTS) score, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and IPSS Quality of Life index (IPSS QoL). RESULTS: Several statistically significant but weak correlations were observed: BWT and weight (r = 0.216, P = 0.032); BWT and BMI (r = 0.246, P = 0.014); UEBW and weight (r = 0.304, P = 0.002); and UEBW and BMI (r = 0.260, P = 0.009). Bladder filling volume appeared to have a greater effect on BWT than on UEBW, although this could not be determined accurately. There was a substantial difference in measurements of BWT and UEBW in the assessment of inter- and intra-observer reliability testing. CONCLUSION: Further studies are required to validate automated measurements of BWT and UEBW and to investigate such measurements in the symptomatic and asymptomatic male population.
