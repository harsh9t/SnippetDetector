PURPOSE: Fibromyalgia is a syndrome of unknown origin with a high prevalence. Multimodal approaches seem to be the treatment of choice in fibromyalgia. A multidisciplinary program was developed and implemented for patients with fibromyalgia in the primary care setting. The program included education (seven sessions) and physical therapy (25 sessions). METHOD: Patients were referred to the program by their general practitioner or by a medical specialist. A prospective non-controlled treatment study was performed, patients were evaluated before, after and three months after the program (single group time series design). The following measurements were performed: The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, RAND 36, the Pain Coping and Cognition List, the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia, two physical tests and a qualitative evaluation. Data of 65 patients with fibromyalgia were analysed, of whom 97% were female. The mean age was 44 and the mean duration of pain was nine years. RESULTS: Data of 65 patients with fibromyalgia were analysed, patients significantly improved on the domains feeling good, pain, fatigue, stiffness, quality of life, catastrophizing and on the physical tests. CONCLUSION: The multidisciplinary program fibromyalgia implemented in primary care seems feasible and the results are promising.
