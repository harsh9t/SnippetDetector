A previous study indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) played pivotal roles in mediating cytotoxicity of evodiamine in human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. This study suggested that G2/M cell cycle arrest was triggered by ROS/NO productions with regulations of p53, p21, cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), Cdc2 and cyclin B1, which were able to be prevented by protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity inhibitor genistein or JNK inhibitor SP600125. The decreased JNK phosphorylation by addition of Ras or Raf inhibitor, as well as the increased cell viability by addition of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), Ras, Raf or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, further demonstrated that the Ras-Raf-JNK pathway was responsible for this PTK-mediated signalling. These observations provide a distinct look at PTK pathway for its suppressive effect on G2/M transition by inductions of ROS/NO generations.
