Some patients with nickel (Ni) allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) suffer from systemic symptoms after ingestion of Ni-rich foods, a condition termed Systemic Nickel Allergy Syndrome (SNAS). The aim of this study is to investigate in children the relationship between Ni ACD and lymphocyte subsets or susceptibility to infections. Nineteen children with Ni ACD and 18 controls matched for sex and age were enrolled. All participants underwent patch test, skin prick test and clinical assessment. Serum immunoglobulins and flow cytometry for lymphocyte subset study were also evaluated. In children with Ni ACD a higher incidence of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and recurrent otitis media were detected. Serum levels of immunoglobulins and lymphocyte subsets did not show significant changes (p>0.05) between the two groups studied. We can hypothesize that in children with Ni ACD the risk of recurrent infections is increased. Although the clinical manifestations of SNAS are still controversial, we can suppose that recurrent infections may be considered a clinical symptom of this syndrome.
