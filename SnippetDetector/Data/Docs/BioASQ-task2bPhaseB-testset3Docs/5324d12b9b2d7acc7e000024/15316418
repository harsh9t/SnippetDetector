OBJECTIVES: Oesophagitis and gastro-oesophageal reflux have been implicated recently in the manifestations of coeliac disease. The aim was to investigate this association in a primary-care setting. METHODS: First, the prevalence of coeliac disease was calculated in 1198 adults with oesophagitis, in 2541 adults with reflux symptoms and in 200 adults suffering from dysphagia; 5459 patients with a history consistent with dyspepsia and 709 patients with a suspicion of coeliac disease served as controls. Second, the prevalence of oesophagitis was estimated in 382 untreated and 232 treated coeliac patients; controls here comprised 5404 patients with dyspeptic symptoms and 2525 patients with reflux symptoms. Third, oesophagitis and oesophageal reflux symptoms were investigated before and after a gluten-free diet was followed in 67 adults with coeliac disease. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was based on small-bowel histology; histological exclusion of the disease was unambiguous in all controls. Oesophagitis was identified by endoscopic inspection. RESULTS: Altogether, 0.9% of patients with oesophagitis and 0.6% of those with oesophageal reflux symptoms had coeliac disease. The corresponding percentages were 1.0% in patients with dyspepsia and 12% with suspicion of coeliac disease. The prevalence of oesophagitis was 5.2% in untreated coeliac disease, 5.6% in treated coeliac disease, 7.0% in patients with dyspepsia, and 27% in symptomatic reflux disease. In coeliac patients, the reflux symptoms were mild but nevertheless were alleviated on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the conception that patients with reflux oesophagitis should be screened vigorously for coeliac disease. The association between these two conditions is, at most, weak, but a gluten-free diet may still bring symptomatic relief for reflux symptoms in coeliac disease.
