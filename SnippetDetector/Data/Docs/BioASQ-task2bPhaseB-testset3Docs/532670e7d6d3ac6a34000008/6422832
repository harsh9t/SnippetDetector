The effect of a surgical stress on serum TSH, T4, free T4, T3, rT3 and TBG was measured before, during and after a coronary bypass operation. Precautions were taken to age, sex, pre-operative nutritional state, anamnestic illness, pre- and post-operative medication. Compared to the pre-operative period TSH increased during operation and normalized at the first post-operative day, while only minor alterations for total and free serum T4 were observed. T3 and rT3 declined at the start of extracorporal circulation, T3 remained reduced during the post-operative period, while rT3 reached its pre-operative value at the first post-operative day. It is concluded that the coronary bypass operation evokes a rapid decline in T3, which is not normalized by the TSH induced response of the thyroid gland, while the post-operative period is characterized by a "low T3 state". The clinical relevance of this finding is discussed with respect to the cardiovascular and the nutritional state of the patients in the post-operative period.
