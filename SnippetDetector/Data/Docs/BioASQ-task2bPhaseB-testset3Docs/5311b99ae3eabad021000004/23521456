OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to review and evaluate the various parameters used in determining renal status. CONCLUSION: The physiologic determination of renal status is the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR). Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and estimated GFR (eGFR), based on serum creatinine have failed to replace mGFR. All physicians should be aware of limitations of substituted mGFR.
