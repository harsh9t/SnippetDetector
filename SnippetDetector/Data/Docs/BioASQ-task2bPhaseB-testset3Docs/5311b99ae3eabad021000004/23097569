To estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in conscious rabbits, a single-sample method using the non-ionic contrast medium iodixanol was compared with a three-sample method using the standard agent inulin. Iodixanol and inulin were co-administered intravenously to male New Zealand White rabbits at 60 mg I/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively, and blood was collected 30, 60, 90 and 120 min later. Serum iodixanol and inulin concentrations were separately determined by high performance liquid chromatography and colorimetry, respectively. Serum urea nitrogen (UN) and creatinine concentrations were also determined. Based on the data from healthy and cisplatin-treated rabbits, the GFR estimated by iodixanol was well consistent with that by inulin. Further, when the GFR decreased to more than 60% of the reference value, serum creatinine concentrations became elevated. However, serum UN concentrations exhibited wide fluctuations, presumably due to a difference in renal handlings. The single-sample method using iodixanol was considered to be an expedient tool in both clinical and research settings, because the stress due to a multi-sample method was reduced.
