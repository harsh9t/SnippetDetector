Male Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) is an increasingly recognized problem particularly after the treatment of prostate cancer. Postprostatectomy incontinence is a major problem that needs to be solved, since it has great impact on quality of life affecting the patient's physical activity and social well-being. The initial treatment for SUI that persists after 12 months consists of conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle exercises and behavioral therapy. Properly selected and informed patients can also be treated efficiently with minimally invasive procedures such as the implantation of a male suburethral sling, although the experience with such devices is not extensive. However, the implantation of artificial urinary sphincter is the gold standard therapy.
