OBJECTIVES: To evaluate retrospectively the objective and subjective parameters in 42 male patients who underwent bone anchored sub-urethral sling positioning (BAUS) for SUI (stress urinary incontinence) due to ISD (intrinsic sphincter deficiency). METHODS: Patients with SUI due to radical retropubic prostatectomy (36 patients), transurethral resection of prostate (5 patients) and open simple prostatectomy (1 patient) underwent BAUS positioning between July 1999 and September 2005 (mean FU = 41 months). Before and after surgery, the patients were evaluated by physical examination, urethrocystoscopy, urodynamics, 1 h pad test and QoL questionnaire. Surgical technique involved perineal implantation to the pubic rami using four anchors of a sub-urethral sling made of synthetic (26 patients), biological (4 patients) or mixed (12 patients) material. Patients were stratified into three groups: (1) Cured: dry patients at stress test, pad weight 0-1 g. (2) Improved: patients with mild-moderate incontinence, pad weight 2-50 g. (3) Failed: unchanged patients, pad weight > 50 g. RESULTS: At the final follow-up visit cured, improved and failed patients were 26 (62%), 4 (8%) and 12 (30%), respectively. Mean pad weight significantly decreased from 104.6 to 47.3 g (55%) and mean total questionnaire score significantly increased to 50.7 (66%). Mean ALPP significantly increased to 50.4 cmH2O (44.8%). Better results were seen with synthetic slings. Main complications were perineal pain (76%), detrusor overactivity (12%) and sling infection (4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: BAUS implantation is a safe, effective, minimally invasive option for iatrogenic male incontinence due to ISD. It compares favourably with AUS.
