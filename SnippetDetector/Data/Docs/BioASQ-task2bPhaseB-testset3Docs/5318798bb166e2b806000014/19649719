The purpose of this study is to investigate in vitro and ex vivo effects of matrine on the growth of human lung cancer and hepatoma cells and the cancer cell migration as well as the expressions of related proteins in the cancer cells. Matrine significantly inhibited the in vitro and ex vivo growth of human non-small cell lung cancer A549 and hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. Matrine induced the apoptosis in A549 and SMMC-7721 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that matrine dose-dependently down-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up-regulated the level of pro-apoptotic protein bax, eventually leading the reduction of ratios of Bcl-2/Bax proteins in A549 and SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, matrine significantly suppressed the A549 cell migration without reducing the cell viability. In addition, matrine dramatically reduced the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A in A549 cells. More importantly, matrine markedly enhanced the anticancer activity of anticancer agent trichostatin A (the histone deacetylase inhibitor) by strongly reducing the viability and/or the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein in A549 cells. Our findings suggest that matrine may have the broad therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic application in the treatment of human non-small cell lung cancer and hepatoma.
