INTRODUCTION: Rho-kinase (ROCK) is a serine/threonine kinase and is one of the major downstream effectors of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rho. In the past few years, evidence has been accumulating to suggest that the RhoA/ROCK system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of a number of cardiovascular and urogenital disorders. AIM: The aim of this study is to review the literature pertaining to the role of the RhoA/ROCK system in male urogenital function. METHODS: Comprehensive literature review was performed using PubMed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inhibitors of ROCK may have potential therapeutic applications, as derived from preclinical and a few clinical studies. RESULTS: Published reports suggest that elevated RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling plays a role in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, kidney failure, ejaculation disorders, prostate and bladder cancer initiation, and eventual metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: This review focuses on our current understanding of the role of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway in the regulation of the male urogenital system. Rho-kinase inhibitors may evolve into an important pharmacologic option in the future treatment of urogenital system disorders.
