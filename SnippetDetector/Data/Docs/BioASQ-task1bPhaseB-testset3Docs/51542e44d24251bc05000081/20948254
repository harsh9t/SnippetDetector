BACKGROUND: EGFR-TKI yields a long survival period in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially those with EGFR gene mutations, but the effect is limited. The later treatment strategy is still a large problem. Efficacy by re-treatment with EGFR-TKI is sometimes reported, but its clinical significance is not clear. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 22 cases (gefitinib 11 cases and erlotinib 11 cases) of NSCLC re-treated with EGFR-TKI in our hospital from August 2004 to August 2009. RESULTS: After re-treatment with gefitinib, four cases showed disease control. Efficacy of erlotinib was recognized in the cases in which disease control was obtained by initial treatment with gefitinib. The disease control rate was 36% (4/11) in the gefitinib group and 45% (5/11) in the erlotinib group. Median survival time was 212 days and 292 days from re-treatment with EGFR-TKI, respectively. CONCLUSION: Re-administration of EGFR-TKI was effective, and therefore is considered one of the treatment options for patients who once respond to gefitinib, until new anti-cancer drugs are available.
