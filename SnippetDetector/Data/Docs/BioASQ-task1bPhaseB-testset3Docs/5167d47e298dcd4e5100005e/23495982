BACKGROUND: Advances in the treatment of breast cancer have led to a reduction in breast-cancer-related mortality. However, these therapies are known to be associated with toxicities. Thus there is a crucial need to accurately define the populations of women with an excellent prognosis who may safely avoid the risks of systemic therapy. Recent developments utilizing novel technologies that incorporate our growing understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of breast cancer strive to better identify these patients. OBJECTIVE: To provide a review of newer prognostic markers with a focus on the 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX(™)), 70-gene prognosis profile (Mammaprint(®)), and Adjuvant! Online. CONCLUSION: These techniques differ in their execution and application and have been demonstrated to provide further data on risk stratification as compared with conventional breast-cancer-risk factors.
