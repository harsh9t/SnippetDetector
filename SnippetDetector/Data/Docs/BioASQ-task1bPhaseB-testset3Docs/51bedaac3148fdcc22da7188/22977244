Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a degradative cellular pathway that protects eukaryotic cells from stress, starvation, and microbial infection. This process must be tightly controlled because too little or too much autophagy can be deleterious to cellular physiology. The phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase Vps34 is a lipid kinase that regulates autophagy, but the role of other PtdIns kinases has not been examined. Here we demonstrate a role for PtdIns 4-kinases and PtdIns4P 5-kinases in selective and nonselective types of autophagy in yeast. The PtdIns 4-kinase Pik1 is involved in Atg9 trafficking through the Golgi and is involved in both nonselective and selective types of autophagy, whereas the PtdIns4P 5-kinase Mss4 is specifically involved in mitophagy but not nonselective autophagy. Our data indicate that phosphoinositide kinases have multiple roles in the regulation of autophagic pathways.
