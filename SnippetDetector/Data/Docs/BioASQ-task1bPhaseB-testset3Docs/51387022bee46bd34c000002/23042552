Microsynteny and enomic egulatory omains
he two main mechanisms considered to underlie microsynteny in metazoans are the presence of fragile regions at the edges of chromosomal rearrangements (evzner and esler 2003) and the presence of constraints that influence where breakpoints cannot be accommodated (urst et al. 2004). tudies in the genus rosophila indicate that although fragile regions seem to have prevailed in shaping gene organization over time, constraints have prevented the occurrence of chromosomal breakpoints in at least β�15% of the intergenic regions (von rotthuss et al. 2010). nalysis of the top 1% largest microsynteny blocks, or ultraconserved regions (s), revealed that the genomic feature most prominently found was an unusually high presence of nucleotide sequences that are 98% identical over at least 50 bp in all pairwise species comparisons, which are otherwise known as highly conserved noncoding elements (s) (ngstrom et al. 2007; von rotthuss et al. 2010).
xperimental evidence has revealed a role for s in regulating gene expression, sometimes over long distances (de la alle-ustienes et al. 2005; hin and ho 2005; oolfe et al. 2005; ennacchio et al. 2006). n addition, dense clusters of s (s peaks hereafter) have been found around genes regulating development (indblad-oh et al. 2005). ecause  peaks predominantly reside in microsynteny blocks that contain developmental regulatory genes both in vertebrates and insects (ngstrom et al. 2007; ikuta et al. 2007), it has been proposed that the pressure to maintain these regulatory interactions would be the major constraint that explains microsynteny. erturbation of these interactions might result in gene misexpression with a corresponding fitness cost (oode et al. 2005; pitz et al. 2005; eong et al. 2006).
icrosynteny blocks harboring 164  peaks have been documented in comparative analyses of the genus rosophila (ngstrom et al. 2007). ome of these same microsynteny blocks were found to include genes involved in development as inferred by their ene ntology () term annotation. hese genes preferentially possess initiator-type (nr) core promoters, thus reinforcing the notion that s might be selectively targeting a particular class of genes and that the microsynteny blocks where s reside encompass genomic regulatory domains (s). owever, this early characterization of microsynteny blocks harboring putative s was hampered for several reasons. irst, the physical limits of the microsynteny blocks could not be precisely delineated because several rosophila lineages that have accumulated multiple chromosomal breakpoints were not included. n addition, the gene expression profile used in the study was confined to embryogenesis in rosophila melanogaster (anak et al. 2006), and the  annotation was incomplete; other types of phenotypic information such as essentiality were not considered. herefore, a precise characterization of the microsynteny blocks that encompass putative s in the genus rosophila is still lacking.
omparative analysis of nine rosophila species that accumulate β�380 million years of divergence allowed the mapping of 145  peaks in 123 of the 2,683 microsynteny blocks that form the rosophila genome (von rotthuss et al. 2010). urther, transcriptome information from 30 developmental stages (raveley et al. 2011), and extended functional annotation and mutant phenotypic information are currently available allowing for a more refined characterization. ere, we use these more comprehensive data sets to examine the structural hallmarks of these 123 microsynteny blocks, perform a thorough characterization of the phenotypic attributes of putative  targets residing in these regions, and inspect the physical relationship between these putative targets and  peaks.Microsynteny and Genomic Regulatory Domains
The two main mechanisms considered to underlie microsynteny in metazoans are the presence of fragile regions at the edges of chromosomal rearrangements (Pevzner and Tesler 2003) and the presence of constraints that influence where breakpoints cannot be accommodated (Hurst et al. 2004). Studies in the genus Drosophila indicate that although fragile regions seem to have prevailed in shaping gene organization over time, constraints have prevented the occurrence of chromosomal breakpoints in at least β�Ό15% of the intergenic regions (von Grotthuss et al. 2010). Analysis of the top 1% largest microsynteny blocks, or ultraconserved regions (UCRs), revealed that the genomic feature most prominently found was an unusually high presence of nucleotide sequences that are 98% identical over at least 50 bp in all pairwise species comparisons, which are otherwise known as highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) (Engstrom et al. 2007; von Grotthuss et al. 2010).
Experimental evidence has revealed a role for HCNEs in regulating gene expression, sometimes over long distances (de la Calle-Mustienes et al. 2005; Shin and Cho 2005; Woolfe et al. 2005; Pennacchio et al. 2006). In addition, dense clusters of HCNEs (HCNEs peaks hereafter) have been found around genes regulating development (Lindblad-Toh et al. 2005). Because HCNE peaks predominantly reside in microsynteny blocks that contain developmental regulatory genes both in vertebrates and insects (Engstrom et al. 2007; Kikuta et al. 2007), it has been proposed that the pressure to maintain these regulatory interactions would be the major constraint that explains microsynteny. Perturbation of these interactions might result in gene misexpression with a corresponding fitness cost (Goode et al. 2005; Spitz et al. 2005; Jeong et al. 2006).
Microsynteny blocks harboring 164 HCNE peaks have been documented in comparative analyses of the genus Drosophila (Engstrom et al. 2007). Some of these same microsynteny blocks were found to include genes involved in development as inferred by their Gene Ontology (GO) term annotation. These genes preferentially possess initiator-type (Inr) core promoters, thus reinforcing the notion that HCNEs might be selectively targeting a particular class of genes and that the microsynteny blocks where HCNEs reside encompass genomic regulatory domains (GRDs). However, this early characterization of microsynteny blocks harboring putative GRDs was hampered for several reasons. First, the physical limits of the microsynteny blocks could not be precisely delineated because several Drosophila lineages that have accumulated multiple chromosomal breakpoints were not included. In addition, the gene expression profile used in the study was confined to embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster (Manak et al. 2006), and the GO annotation was incomplete; other types of phenotypic information such as essentiality were not considered. Therefore, a precise characterization of the microsynteny blocks that encompass putative GRDs in the genus Drosophila is still lacking.
Comparative analysis of nine Drosophila species that accumulate β�Ό380 million years of divergence allowed the mapping of 145 HCNE peaks in 123 of the 2,683 microsynteny blocks that form the Drosophila genome (von Grotthuss et al. 2010). Further, transcriptome information from 30 developmental stages (Graveley et al. 2011), and extended functional annotation and mutant phenotypic information are currently available allowing for a more refined characterization. Here, we use these more comprehensive data sets to examine the structural hallmarks of these 123 microsynteny blocks, perform a thorough characterization of the phenotypic attributes of putative HCNE targets residing in these regions, and inspect the physical relationship between these putative targets and HCNE peaks.

Genomic rganization of icrosynteny locks ncompassing onserved s
he frequency of s per sequence length unit is known to increase with the size of the microsynteny blocks, in stark contrast to peaks of stretches of coding  (ngstrom et al. 2007). arly estimates also indicated that only 12% of the microsynteny blocks spanning  peaks were of small size (<3 protein-coding genes). ollectively, these observations suggested a positive correlation between the size of the microsynteny blocks, which can be thought of as a proxy for genome stability, and the presence of  peaks. o analyze this with a more comprehensive data set, we retrieved the coordinates and gene content of the 123 microsynteny blocks delineated based on comparative information of nine rosophila species and known to harbor  peaks (von rotthuss et al. 2010). hese 123 microsynteny blocks include 1,321 protein-coding genes inferred to be present in the ancestor of the species analyzed. our rosophila species not previously included in the previous analysis (. erecta, . yakuba, . willistoni, and . grimshawi) were included here. hey represent lineages that have accumulated β�40% of the total number of chromosomal breakpoints (von rotthuss et al. 2010). his increase in the number of chromosomal breakpoints did not result in a substantial difference in the proportion of microsynteny blocks that were small; eight (or 6.5%) microsynteny blocks were found to include <3 protein-coding genes (supplementary data set 1, upplementary aterial online). n accordance with this, the 123 microsynteny blocks spanning  peaks were of a larger than expected size when tested against a random distribution of s across the genome (onte arlo simulations,  < 0.01). his result was robust regardless of the unit used to measure the size of the microsynteny blocks (table 1). e also examined whether the larger size trend holds when the s are excluded because unlike these, other microsynteny blocks harboring  peaks can have a much more limited size (supplementary data set 1, upplementary aterial online). e found this to be the case (onte arlo simulations,  < 0.01; table 1). herefore, the association between  density and genome stability over evolutionary time, using the size of microsynteny blocks as a proxy, is a general property of the fraction of the genome represented by all microsynteny blocks harboring  peaks and not exclusive of s.

We next explored the genome distribution of HCNE peaks; 14.6% (18/123) of the microsynteny blocks contained more than one HCNE peak. This colocalization of HCNE peaks in the same microsynteny block was significantly higher than expected by chance, because Monte Carlo simulations indicated that a random distribution would result in 145 HCNE peaks being scattered over 131β€“144 microsynteny blocks, with only 1β€“13 of these harboring more than one HCNE peak (0.5thβ€“99.5th percentiles). Further, HCNE peaks were found to be randomly distributed along the main chromosomal elements that make up the Drosophila genome (Muller's elements Aβ€“E; Muller 1940) (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Together, these results indicate that HCNE peaks are located in genomic regions that are more refractory to disruption by chromosomal rearrangements, tend to colocalize more often than expected by chance, and are evenly distributed across Drosophila chromosomes.

Functional ttributes of  argets
wo proxies have been used to identify the genes that are regulated by  peaks (ngstrom et al. 2007). he first is their association with diagnostic  terms related to the regulation of developmental processes (i.e., with regulation of transcription, :0006355 and/or multicellular organismal development, :0007275). he second is the presence of specific types of core promoters that might be selectively regulated by  enhancers. pproximately 95% of developmental regulators present in microsynteny blocks harboring  peaks contained some kind of nr motif: nr alone; nr/ (initiator followed by a downstream promoter element); or /nr ( box followed by initiator) (ngstrom et al. 2007). e inspected genes encompassed in the 123 microsynteny blocks harboring  peaks and found reliable core promoter predictions for β�42.1% (556/1,321) of genes, which were distributed across all but one of the microsynteny blocks (see aterials and ethods and supplementary data set 2, upplementary aterial online). urthermore, β�20.5% (271/1,321) of the genes were found to be annotated with at least one diagnostic  term. he new data included in this analysis led to a redistribution of the proportions of genes found both with specific promoter types and with the regulation of development  terms, compared with the previous analysis (supplementary fig. 1a and b, upplementary aterial online).
o better characterize the genes that are most likely to be targeted by  peaks, we further examined 176 genes that had both core promoter predictions and were associated with diagnostic  terms (supplementary table 2, upplementary aterial online). enes with core promoters spanning the motifs nr alone and nr/ were more tightly associated (β�10.8% and β�7.6%, respectively, more than expected by chance) with diagnostic  terms than other types of promoter motifs (randomization test of goodness-of-fit, adjusted = 6.0 — 10β�’5; table 2; fig. 1). his led us to group genes with these two types of promoters in downstream analyses. mportantly, and unlike in a previous study (ngstrom et al. 2007), for our downstream analyses, we considered genes associated with at least one diagnostic  term and did not limit our analyses to those associated with both, that is, developmental regulator genes. here are two other patterns of expression that are also compatible with regulation mediated by s. irst, genes involved in developmental and differentiation tasks that are not transcription factors, for example, those encoding ligands and protein receptors, can have comparable complex regulatory inputs as inferred by the size of the downstream and upstream regions where their regulatory sequences reside (elson et al. 2004). econd, genes associated with only one diagnostic  term often showed a pattern of expression developmentally regulated during the life cycle (supplementary fig. 2, upplementary aterial online), which was further supported by the observation that β�43% of these genes exhibited precise spatial expression in the embryo (:0006355: 11/29; :0007275: 67/151; supplementary data set 2, upplementary aterial online). sing these criteria, we considered genes with core promoter motif nr alone or nr/ and associated with at least one diagnostic  term as the best candidates to be targets of  peaks. n the basis of this definition, we found at least one putative target gene in 63 of the 123 microsynteny blocks harboring  peaks.

Subsequently, the Benjaminiβ€“Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) correction for multiple testing was applied.bHigher than a given percentile in at least one timepoint during embryogenesis (E), pupa stage (P), or both and, if it is the case, lower than a given percentile in at least one timepoint in at least two stages among larva (L), adult male (AM), and adult female (AF). Genes examined: with Inr only or Inr/DPE promoter types, 185; with TATA/Inr promoter type, 135; with Motif 1/6 promoter type, 101; and with DRE promoter type, 135.
For many genes, there are now data available on associated mutant phenotypes (Tweedie et al. 2009) and time series expression profiles (Graveley et al. 2011). We evaluated how this new functional information could also refine current proxies for the identification of targets of HCNE peaks. With the mutant phenotype data, we hypothesized that these targets would be more likely to have a severe detrimental mutant phenotype, signifying a functional role during development. Therefore, there would be a tighter association between genes spanning core promoter types Inr alone or Inr/DPE and severe phenotypes (lethal, sterile, or both) than between those same genes and nonsevere phenotypes (viable, fertile, or both), when compared with genes with other core promoters. We could confirm severe and nonsevere detrimental phenotypes for 180 and 93 genes (of 556), respectively. We found a significantly higher ratio of severe to nonsevere detrimental phenotypes for genes with core promoters type Inr alone or Inr/DPE (β�Ό2.4-fold) than for genes with types DRE (DNA replication element binding factor; β�Ό2.1-fold), TATA/Inr (β�Ό1.6-fold), and Motif 1/6 (Motif 1 followed by Motif 6; β�Ό1.2-fold) (randomization test of goodness-of-fit, Padjusted = 1.6 Γ— 10β�’2; table 2). We further examined this relationship between mutant phenotypes and different types of core promoters by focusing on the genes associated with the diagnostic GO terms that reflect a specific, essential role within the developmental program of Drosophila and thus presumably those genes likely regulated by HCNE peaks. We found that the mutant phenotypes of this refined group of genes were less likely to be severe when they had core promoters types TATA/Inr, Motif 1/6, and DRE (i.e., likely non-HCNE targets), compared with genes with core promoter types Inr only or Inr/DPE (two-tailed Fisher's exact test, FET; Inr only or Inr/DPE, Padjusted = 1.5 Γ— 10β�’8; e.g., Motif 1/6, Padjusted = 1.3 Γ— 10β�’3, the closest one; table 3). Therefore, when we confined our analysis to the best candidate genes to be targets of HCNE peaks, we found that they are more likely to be essential compared with genes with other core promoter types.

For mutant phenotypes, the total number of genes for the two categories (severe vs. nonsevere) is 81/34 (Inr only and Inr/DPE), 29/18 (TATA/Inr), 43/20 (Motif 1/6), and 26/21 (DRE). For expression data, the total number of genes for the two categories is 91/94 (Inr only and Inr/DPE), 32/103 (TATA/Inr), 18/83 (Motif 1/6), and 35/100 (DRE).bHigher than a given percentile in at least one timepoint during embryogenesis (E), pupa stage (P), or both and, if it is the case, lower than a given percentile in at least one timepoint in at least two stages among larva (L), adult male (AM), and adult female (AF).
We next examined expression profiles during the Drosophila life cycle. We extracted expression levels across 30 timepoints within five stages (embryo, larva, pupa, adult male, and adult female) and assessed the relationship between expression profiles and particular types of promoters. Genes with Inr only or Inr/DPE promoter types showed the strongest association with expression levels above the 95th percentile in at least one timepoint within embryogenesis, pupa stage, or both (randomization test of goodness-of-fit, Padjusted = 5.7 Γ— 10β�’3; fig. 2 and table 2). Thus, β�Ό89.2% (165/185) of the genes with core promoter type Inr alone or Inr/DPE, as opposed to a β�Ό77.2% (78/101) among genes with core promoter type Motif 1/6, the closest one, exhibit a developmentally specific expression profile. When this demanding expression threshold is relaxed (80th percentile), no differences were found across genes with different promoters (Padjusted = 6.9 Γ— 10β�’1; table 2). Further, coupling the requirement of being expressed above the 95th percentile in at least one timepoint within embryogenesis, pupa stage, or both with a limited expression (i.e., <40th percentile) in at least two timepoints among the other three stages (larva, adult male, and adult female) was of similar significance to expression levels above the 95th percentile in at least one timepoint within embryogenesis, pupa stage, or both (table 2). This result stresses that the most robust pattern associated with the expression profile of genes with core promoter type Inr alone or Inr/DPE is their high expression level during key developmental transitions in Drosophila regardless of their magnitude of expression in other life stages. However, if we analyze only the genes associated with the diagnostic GO terms, being expressed above the 95th percentile in at least one timepoint within embryogenesis, pupa stage, or both, coupled with limited expression (<40th percentile) in at least one timepoint within at least two of the other three stages (larva, adult male, and adult female), is now more commonly found in genes with promoter type Inr only or Inr/DPE than in genes with different promoter motifs. Under this combination of requirements, genes with promoter type Inr only or Inr/DPE are clearly more tightly associated with this temporal expression profile (FET; Inr only or Inr/DPE, Padjusted = 3.2 Γ— 10β�’7; e.g., Motif 1/6, Padjusted = 7.0 Γ— 10β�’3, the closest one; table 3). This pattern now does hold when the expression threshold during key developmental transitions is decreased from the 95th percentile to the 80th percentile. This result substantiates that genes with promoter type Inr only or Inr/DPE, and also associated with diagnostic GO terms, are more often developmentally regulated than genes with those same GO terms but that posses a different type of promoter.
Fig. 2.β€”Two-way hierarchical clustering of the levels of expression for genes with core promoter type Inr alone or Inr/DPE, and associated with either one or both diagnostic GO terms, across 30 timepoints of the life cycle of D. melanogaster. Red, overexpession; green, underexpression. High levels of expression are common at some point during embryogenesis, and intermediate to high levels of expression are often observed during the larvalβ€“pupal transition. A more reduced number of genes show additionally substantial expression in adult males and females.
In sum, the best candidate genes to be targets of HCNE peaks present in the 123 microsynteny blocks analyzed are characterized by an expression profile more markedly regulated throughout development and by a tendency to show severe mutant phenotypes as opposed to the rest of genes considered. These patterns agree well with the role thought to be played by genes targeted by HCNEs peaks during key developmental transitions although this is not incompatible with being expressed in other life stages.

Internal rganization of icrosynteny locks ncompassing onserved s
e next evaluated the location of  peaks within microsynteny blocks. he median distance between  peaks and the closest outermost markers equaled 32% of the size of the microsynteny blocks examined (supplementary fig. 3, upplementary aterial online), in good agreement with previous estimates (ngstrom et al. 2007). sing . melanogaster as a reference, we find that  peaks are separated from their putative targets by β�65 ± β�55/β�53 kb (average ± standard deviation []/median) or β�32 ± β�42/β�26% of the size of the microsynteny block where both reside. pproximately 3 ± β�5/β�2 intervening protein-coding genes were found between  peaks and their putative target genes, although for β�37% of these targets there was no intervening protein-coding gene (fig. 3 and supplementary fig. 4, upplementary aterial online).

e also explored the patterns of colocalization between  peaks and their putative targets on individual microsynteny blocks. e found no correlation between them (earsonβ€™s correlation coefficient, r = β�’0.0054; >1 putative target and >1  peak on the same microsynteny block occurred in 4 of 63 cases). n fact, onte arlo simulations showed that finding a correlation equal or lower than that observed was unlikely ( = 0.0039). his raises the possibility that a single  peak might regulate more than one putative target gene in some microsynteny blocks, whereas in others, several  peaks might cooperatively regulate a single target. e found 18 and 3 cases out of 63 following these tentative organizational patterns, respectively.
ith the criteria used, we have extracted the main patterns of the architecture of genomic regions with gene arrangement conserved across species harboring  peaks and their putative targets. evertheless, these emerging patterns are not based on the 123 microsynteny blocks, because in 49% (60/123) of them, we did not find a reliable prediction for the presence of at least one putative target. his can result from two nonmutually exclusive possibilities. he first is that a large fraction of genes associated with one or both of the proxies used for the identification of targets of  peaks still remain to be characterized. he second is that the regulation of  peaks may not be as restrictive as previously presumed and may involve genes with core promoter motifs other than nr only and nr/. he use of genome engineering techniques (pitz et al. 2005; iaz-astillo et al. 2012) to perturb the interactions between  peaks and their putative targets, coupled with expression assays (oolfe et al. 2005), will help to more precisely dissect the role of  peaks in impacting gene function within the context of chromosome repatterning. his kind of experimental framework will also generate valuable information that can be used to develop improved computational pipelines for the identification of targets of  peaks, especially in regions where none have been predicted. n the whole, this integrative approach will enable to generate an ultimate portrait of the structural and functional organization of this fraction of the rosophila euchromatin with distinctive evolutionary dynamics.Internal Organization of Microsynteny Blocks Encompassing Conserved GRDs
We next evaluated the location of HCNE peaks within microsynteny blocks. The median distance between HCNE peaks and the closest outermost markers equaled 32% of the size of the microsynteny blocks examined (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online), in good agreement with previous estimates (Engstrom et al. 2007). Using D. melanogaster as a reference, we find that HCNE peaks are separated from their putative targets by β�Ό65 Β± β�Ό55/β�Ό53 kb (average Β± standard deviation [SD]/median) or β�Ό32 Β± β�Ό42/β�Ό26% of the size of the microsynteny block where both reside. Approximately 3 Β± β�Ό5/β�Ό2 intervening protein-coding genes were found between HCNE peaks and their putative target genes, although for β�Ό37% of these targets there was no intervening protein-coding gene (fig. 3 and supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online).

Below, median distance between the HCNE peak and the closest outermost marker expressed as a fraction of the total length of the microsynteny block.

We also explored the patterns of colocalization between HCNE peaks and their putative targets on individual microsynteny blocks. We found no correlation between them (Pearsonβ€™s correlation coefficient, r = β�’0.0054; >1 putative target and >1 HCNE peak on the same microsynteny block occurred in 4 of 63 cases). In fact, Monte Carlo simulations showed that finding a correlation equal or lower than that observed was unlikely (P = 0.0039). This raises the possibility that a single HCNE peak might regulate more than one putative target gene in some microsynteny blocks, whereas in others, several HCNE peaks might cooperatively regulate a single target. We found 18 and 3 cases out of 63 following these tentative organizational patterns, respectively.
With the criteria used, we have extracted the main patterns of the architecture of genomic regions with gene arrangement conserved across species harboring HCNE peaks and their putative targets. Nevertheless, these emerging patterns are not based on the 123 microsynteny blocks, because in 49% (60/123) of them, we did not find a reliable prediction for the presence of at least one putative target. This can result from two nonmutually exclusive possibilities. The first is that a large fraction of genes associated with one or both of the proxies used for the identification of targets of HCNE peaks still remain to be characterized. The second is that the regulation of HCNE peaks may not be as restrictive as previously presumed and may involve genes with core promoter motifs other than Inr only and Inr/DPE. The use of genome engineering techniques (Spitz et al. 2005; Diaz-Castillo et al. 2012) to perturb the interactions between HCNE peaks and their putative targets, coupled with expression assays (Woolfe et al. 2005), will help to more precisely dissect the role of HCNE peaks in impacting gene function within the context of chromosome repatterning. This kind of experimental framework will also generate valuable information that can be used to develop improved computational pipelines for the identification of targets of HCNE peaks, especially in regions where none have been predicted. On the whole, this integrative approach will enable to generate an ultimate portrait of the structural and functional organization of this fraction of the Drosophila euchromatin with distinctive evolutionary dynamics.

Materials and ethods
ynteny nformation and  eaks. We used synteny maps constructed under the requirement of conservation of gene order but not orientation (GO synteny definition in von Grotthuss et al. 2010) across the species D. ananassae, D. erecta, D. grimshawi, D. melanogaster, D. mojavensis, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, D. willistoni, and D. yakuba. Coordinates of the 145 HCNEs peaks in the D. melanogaster genome (release 4.3) were retrieved from Engstrom et al. (2007).Promoter AnalysisCore promoter predictions for transcripts associated with protein-coding genes in microsynteny blocks were performed with McPromoter using the most stringent parameter values (Ohler 2006). We inspected 500 nt upstream of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) start of each transcripts as annotated in FlyBase (Tweedie et al. 2009). In the absence of an annotated 5β€™-UTR, a stretch of DNA of equal length upstream of the first annotated nucleotide was examined.Per Gene Phenotypic and Functional DataExpression profiles during the life cycle of D. melanogaster (Graveley et al. 2011) were retrieved from FlyBase (Tweedie et al. 2009). Reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads across 30 timepoints were log transformed, their relative level of expression per life stage quantified relative to each gene, and compared by unsupervised hierarchical clustering using Wardβ€™s minimum variances as a distance metric. The first principal component was used to assist in the ordering of expression levels. Spatial patterns of expression were obtained from FlyExpress (Kumar et al. 2011). Severe (lethal and/or sterile alleles) and nonsevere (viable and/or fertile alleles) phenotypes were obtained from FlyBase (Tweedie et al. 2009). GO annotations for the category biological process were retrieved from modMine (http://intermine.modencode.org/; last accessed February 2012).Statistical AnalysesWith the exception of the Monte Carlo simulations, all statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute).
