Sequence conservation has traditionally been used as a means to target functional regions of complex genomes. In addition to its use in identifying coding regions of genes, the recent availability of whole genome data for a number of vertebrates has permitted high-resolution analyses of the noncoding "dark matter" of the genome. This has resulted in the identification of a large number of highly conserved sequence elements that appear to be preserved in all bony vertebrates. Further positional analysis of these conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the genome demonstrates that they cluster around genes involved in developmental regulation. This chapter describes the identification and characterization of these elements, with particular reference to their composition and organization.
