Introduction
 homeobox gene hx2 is a member of the  homeobox family of
                transcription factors that are characterized by a -type tandem zinc finger known
                as the  domain and a -binding homeodomain. he hx2 and its
                family member hx9 are the vertebrate homologs of the fruit fly
                    (rosophila) apterous gene.
                    pterous is required for wing development, dorsoventral
                compartmentalization [1], [2] and neuronal pathway selection [3] in
                rosophila. he murine hx2 was identified through
                a screen for early markers of -lymphocyte differentiation and determined to be
                involved in the differentiation of lymphoid and neural cell types [4].
                    hx2-null mice exhibit dorsal telencephalic patterning defects
                that involve an expansion of the choroid plexus and cortical hem at the expense of
                the hippocampus and neocortex [5], [6], ventral diencephalic defects that involve the
                infundibulum and pituitary gland [7], an absence of eyes [8], incomplete development of
                olfactory sensory neurons [9], liver fibrosis [10] and defective erythropoiesis
                resulting in death at 15.5 β€“ 16.5 due to severe anemia [8]. ence, hx2 is
                essential for the normal development of the forebrain, eyes, olfactory system and
                liver. ecent studies have suggested that hx2 acts as a classic
                β€�selectorβ€� gene that induces cortical stem cells to adopt hippocampal or
                neocortex identities [11]. hx2 also plays an important role in
                maintaining hair follicle stem cells in an undifferentiated state [12], and the
                progression of anagen (growth phase) and morphogenesis of hair follicles [13].
n mouse, the expression of hx2 begins at 8.5 in the optic vesicle
                    [8], extending
                to a wide range of tissues by 10.5 including the telencephalon, diencephalon, optic
                cup, midbrain, hindbrain, future spinal cord [14] and liver [15]. t 11.5,
                    hx2 is localized in the walls of the lateral ventricles and
                third ventricle of the brain, the neural retina and optic stalk, the dorsal
                commissural interneurons of the neural tube and additionally expresses in limb bud
                mesenchyme [16]. y 15.5, hx2 expression in the
                cerebral cortex becomes restricted to the ventricular layer and intermediate zone
                    [5] and
                extends to the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity [17]. y 17.5,
                    hx2 expression in the cerebral cortex becomes restricted to
                the superficial layers of the entire cerebral cortex and the hippocampus (except for
                the subiculum) [5]. he restricted embryonic expression pattern of
                    hx2 is closely related to its function during development. or
                example, hx2 has a graded expression pattern in the cortical
                ventricular zone (highest expression in the medial regions and lowest in the lateral
                regions) and is normally absent in the dorsal midline region [6]. his expression gradient is
                crucial for the role of hx2 in specifying cortical cell fate, in
                particular by determining the regional fate (to either neocortex or olfactory
                cortex) in dorsal telencephalic progenitors [18]. n zebrafish, ix3, which is
                required for the formation of the entire rostral prosencephalon, acts upstream of
                hx2 suggesting that ix3 establishes the rostral forebrain field within which hx2
                specifies cortical cell fate [11]. n enopus, transcription factors such
                as ax6 and ix3 regulate the restricted expression of hx2 in the
                developing eye. ogether, these transcription factors form a gene regulatory network
                that helps specify the vertebrate eye field [19]. t has been proposed that
                    hx2 plays a central role in coordinating the various pathways
                that lead to optic cup formation [20]. lthough the spatially and temporally restricted
                expression of hx2 is crucial for proper development of the
                cerebral cortex and the eye, and that previous studies have indicated several
                potential upstream regulators of hx2, no attempt has been made to
                identify and characterize cis-regulatory elements in the
                    hx2 locus.
uman 2 has been reported to be overexpressed in chronic
                myelogenous leukemia () [21], but downregulated in small -cell lymphoma [22] and lung
                cancer [23]. ittle
                is known about the mechanisms by which changes in 2 expression
                occur. he overexpression of 2 in  cells is postulated to be
                caused by decreased  methylation that results from a -
                gene fusion event [24]
                brought about by a translocation between chromosomal regions 22q11 and 9q34 [25]. owever,
                    2 (9q33.3) and  (9q34.12) are separated
                by a chromosomal distance as large as 7 b (human 36 assembly). t remains to be
                seen if there exist cis-regulatory elements in the vicinity of
                    2, whose disruption could account for changes in
                    2 expression.
n this study we have used evolutionary constraint as an indicator of putative
                enhancers in the vertebrate hx2 locus. ue to selective pressure,
                noncoding functional elements such as enhancers tend to evolve slowly compared to
                their neighboring sequences and hence can be identified as conserved noncoding
                elements in comparisons of related genomes. his strategy has been effectively used
                to identify a large number of putative enhancers conserved in distantly related
                vertebrates such as mammals and teleost fishes [26], [27], [28], [29]. unctional assay of such
                elements in transgenic mouse and zebrafish have indeed indicated that a large number
                of them function as transcriptional enhancers directing tissue-specific expression
                of reporter genes during embryonic development [26], [28], [29]. e have aligned sequences
                of the hx2 locus from human, mouse and pufferfish (fugu) genomes
                and predicted conserved noncoding elements (s) in the locus. unctional assay of
                these s in a transgenic mouse assay system showed that half of them function as
                tissue-specific enhancers at embryonic day 11.5.Introduction
LIM homeobox gene Lhx2 is a member of the LIM homeobox family of
                transcription factors that are characterized by a LIM-type tandem zinc finger known
                as the LIM domain and a DNA-binding homeodomain. The Lhx2 and its
                family member Lhx9 are the vertebrate homologs of the fruit fly
                    (Drosophila) apterous gene.
                    Apterous is required for wing development, dorsoventral
                compartmentalization [1], [2] and neuronal pathway selection [3] in
                Drosophila. The murine Lhx2 was identified through
                a screen for early markers of B-lymphocyte differentiation and determined to be
                involved in the differentiation of lymphoid and neural cell types [4].
                    Lhx2-null mice exhibit dorsal telencephalic patterning defects
                that involve an expansion of the choroid plexus and cortical hem at the expense of
                the hippocampus and neocortex [5], [6], ventral diencephalic defects that involve the
                infundibulum and pituitary gland [7], an absence of eyes [8], incomplete development of
                olfactory sensory neurons [9], liver fibrosis [10] and defective erythropoiesis
                resulting in death at E15.5 β€“ E16.5 due to severe anemia [8]. Hence, Lhx2 is
                essential for the normal development of the forebrain, eyes, olfactory system and
                liver. Recent studies have suggested that Lhx2 acts as a classic
                β€�selectorβ€� gene that induces cortical stem cells to adopt hippocampal or

                    Lhx2 is localized in the walls of the lateral ventricles and
                third ventricle of the brain, the neural retina and optic stalk, the dorsal
                commissural interneurons of the neural tube and additionally expresses in limb bud
                mesenchyme [16]. By E15.5, Lhx2 expression in the
                cerebral cortex becomes restricted to the ventricular layer and intermediate zone
                    [5] and
                extends to the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity [17]. By E17.5,
                    Lhx2 expression in the cerebral cortex becomes restricted to
                the superficial layers of the entire cerebral cortex and the hippocampus (except for
                the subiculum) [5]. The restricted embryonic expression pattern of
                    Lhx2 is closely related to its function during development. For
                example, Lhx2 has a graded expression pattern in the cortical
                ventricular zone (highest expression in the medial regions and lowest in the lateral
                regions) and is normally absent in the dorsal midline region [6]. This expression gradient is
                crucial for the role of Lhx2 in specifying cortical cell fate, in
                particular by determining the regional fate (to either neocortex or olfactory
                cortex) in dorsal telencephalic progenitors [18]. In zebrafish, Six3, which is
                required for the formation of the entire rostral prosencephalon, acts upstream of
                Lhx2 suggesting that Six3 establishes the rostral forebrain field within which Lhx2
                specifies cortical cell fate [11]. In Xenopus, transcription factors such
                as Pax6 and Six3 regulate the restricted expression of Lhx2 in the
                developing eye. Together, these transcription factors form a gene regulatory network
                that helps specify the vertebrate eye field [19]. It has been proposed that
                    Lhx2 plays a central role in coordinating the various pathways
                that lead to optic cup formation [20]. Although the spatially and temporally restricted

                identify and characterize cis-regulatory elements in the
                    Lhx2 locus.
Human LHX2 has been reported to be overexpressed in chronic
                myelogenous leukemia (CML) [21], but downregulated in small B-cell lymphoma [22] and lung
                cancer [23]. Little
                is known about the mechanisms by which changes in LHX2 expression
                occur. The overexpression of LHX2 in CML cells is postulated to be
                caused by decreased DNA methylation that results from a BCR-ABL
                gene fusion event [24]
                brought about by a translocation between chromosomal regions 22q11 and 9q34 [25]. However,
                    LHX2 (9q33.3) and ABL (9q34.12) are separated
                by a chromosomal distance as large as 7 Mb (human NCBI36 assembly). It remains to be
                seen if there exist cis-regulatory elements in the vicinity of
                    LHX2, whose disruption could account for changes in
                    LHX2 expression.
In this study we have used evolutionary constraint as an indicator of putative
                enhancers in the vertebrate Lhx2 locus. Due to selective pressure,
                noncoding functional elements such as enhancers tend to evolve slowly compared to

                of the Lhx2 locus from human, mouse and pufferfish (fugu) genomes
                and predicted conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the locus. Functional assay of
                these CNEs in a transgenic mouse assay system showed that half of them function as
                tissue-specific enhancers at embryonic day 11.5.

Methods
thics statement. All animals were cared for in strict accordance with National Institutes of
                    Health (USA) guidelines. The protocol was approved by the BRC Institutional
                    Animal Care and Use Committee, Singapore (permit number 080338).Riboprobes for in situ hybridizationPrimers that would produce 300-500 bp riboprobes were designed for murine genes
                        Lhx2, Crb2 and Dennd1a.
                    PCR products were cloned into pBluescript II KS vector and sequenced to verify
                    sequence identity and transcription orientation. The synthesis of digoxygenin
                    (DIG)-labeled riboprobe was carried out based on published protocols [30] with the
                    following modification: transcription was stopped by adding 1 Βµl of
                    RNase-free DNase I (10 units/Βµl; Roche, Germany) and incubating at
                    37Β°C for 15 min. RNA concentration was in the range of 300β€“400
                    ng/Βµl. The riboprobes were designed to target the 5th (last), 7th and 22nd
                    (last) coding exons of the mouse Lhx2, Crb2
                    and Dennd1a genes respectively, and spanned 490 bp, 319 bp and
                    488 bp respectively.Whole-mount in situ hybridizationWhole-mount in situ hybridization of riboprobes was carried out as per published
                    protocols [30],
                    with the following modifications. For the Proteinase K step, concentration used
                    was 10 Βµg/ml for 15 min; for hybridization, concentration of riboprobe
                    used was 1 Βµg/ml; for post-hybridization washes, TBST instead of MABT was
                    used; and for antibody incubation, embryos were incubated overnight in
                    10% heat-inactivated horse serum/1% blocking reagent (Roche,
                    Germany)/TBST with 1β�¶2000 anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
                    antibody (Roche, Germany). Before photo-taking, embryos were cleared in
                    50% glycerol/PBT and 80% glycerol/PBT (both times till embryos
                    sunk). Pictures of the embryos were taken under 16Γ— magnification using an
                    Olympus SZX16 stereomicroscope (fitted with Olympus DP20 camera) and dark-field
                    illumination.Lhx2 locus sequence and alignmentRepeat-masked sequences for Lhx2 locus from human, mouse and
                    fugu genomes were downloaded from Ensembl release 48 (http://www.ensembl.org/) (human NCBI36 assembly, mouse NCBIM37
                    assembly and fugu v4.0 assembly). The sequences were aligned using MLAGAN [31]. CNEs were
                    predicted using VISTA [32] based on the conservation criteria of β‰¥65%
                    identity over 50 bp. Protein-coding and ncRNA sequences were identified and
                    excluded based on searches against NCBI NR protein database, human and mouse EST
                    databases (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/), Rfam (http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/) and mirBase (http://www.mirbase.org/).Transgene constructsTransgene constructs were prepared by linking CNEs upstream of a mouse
                        hsp68 minimal promoter (denoted as
                        β€�pHsp68β€� in this report) and bacterial
                    Ξ²-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ). The
                        pHsp68-lacZ-pBluescript vector was originally designed by
                    Kothary et al. [33] and later modified by Nadav Ahituv (Lawrence Berkeley
                    National Laboratory, USA) to incorporate a GatewayΒ® cassette
                        (attR1-ccdB-attR2) upstream of pHsp68 for
                    efficient cloning by GatewayΒ® Technology (Invitrogen, USA). The
                        hsp68 minimal promoter alone has been shown to drive no
                        lacZ expression in transgenic mice from E6.5 to E15.5 [33]. For PCR
                    amplification of CNEs, primers were designed with 100β€“200 bp of additional
                    flanking sequence on each side of the CNE with leading attB1/attB2 sequences for
                    GatewayΒ® DNA recombination. PCR was carried out using mouse genomic DNA as a
                    template. β€�BPβ€™ and β€�LRβ€™ recombination reactions were
                    carried out to clone the PCR product upstream of pHsp68. For
                    both reactions, vector PCR was conducted to confirm that recombination was
                    successful and the clones were sequenced to verify sequence identity. To
                    generate constructs with base substitutions, QuikChangeΒ® Site-Directed
                    Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, USA) was used.Transgenic miceTo prepare the transgene DNA for pronuclear microinjection, a restriction digest
                    using SalI (or double digest using HindIII and
                        NotI) was performed to remove the
                        pBluescript backbone. The transgene DNA was gel-purified
                    (β�Ό5 kb fragment) from vector backbone DNA (β�Ό2.9 kb) using GenecleanΒ®
                    II Kit (Qbiogene, USA) and its concentration was estimated by running against
                    known amounts of 1 Kb Plus DNA ladder (Invitrogen, USA). The DNA was diluted
                    with filtered TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) to a final
                    concentration of 4 ng/Βµl and centrifuged twice at full speed for 15 min
                    each to remove impurities, each time transferring 80% of the supernatant
                    to a new tube. Transgenic mice were generated as per the standard protocol [34] using FVB/N
                    mice as the host strain. DNA was extracted from the visceral yolk sac of embryos
                    and used for genotyping by PCR using primers that amplify a 416-bp region which
                    spans nucleotides 568 to 983 of the lacZ gene (GenBank

                    photo-taking, embryos were cleared in 50% glycerol/PBT and 80%
                    glycerol/PBT (both times till embryos sunk).Expression analysis of human TF-encoding genesGNF Human GeneAtlas v2 data (MAS5-condensed) were downloaded from GNF SymAtlas
                        [36].
                    Expression values derived from cell lines and pathogenic tissues were removed,
                    leaving behind expression values for 62 normal human tissues. To eliminate
                    probes that showed very low expression and insufficient variance in expression
                    levels across all tissues, probes with mean expression values less than 100 and
                    standard deviation less than 50 were excluded [37]. Probe identifiers were mapped
                    to human Ensembl gene identifiers using Ensembl BioMart (for HG-U133A probes)
                        (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) and the annotation
                    table from GNF SymAtlas (for GNF1H probes). Each gene's expression value in
                    each tissue was computed by averaging expression values of all probes
                    corresponding to that gene and normalizing the resulting value across 62 normal
                    tissues such that mean expression is 0 and standard deviation is 1. Following
                    this procedure, expression data were available for 17,210 human genes.
                        K-means clustering was then performed on the normalized
                    gene expression values with Cluster [38] and visualized with
                    TreeView (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). To test the alternative
                    hypothesis that the average number (and length) of human-fugu CNEs associated
                    with genes grouped into a cluster varies from that of genes grouped into other
                    clusters, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied. Two-tailed
                    P-values were calculated.Motif findingStatistically over-represented motifs were searched in human-fugu CNEs of
                    TF-encoding genes using Weeder Version 1.3.1 [39]. Using oligomer frequencies
                    in human intergenic regions as background, we searched both sequence strands for
                    over-represented 8-mers with at most 2 substitutions, which appeared in at least
                    50% of the sequences and could occur more than once per sequence. Our
                    search for 10-mers and 12-mers yielded no significant motifs. Interesting motifs
                    with many close variants among the best 100 reported motifs were found using the
                    program β€�adviser.outβ€� in the Weeder package [39]. A chi-squared test (2-by-2
                    contingency table with Yates' correction for continuity; one-tailed
                        P-values adjusted with Bonferroni correction) was used to
                    determine which of these interesting motifs were over-represented
                        (P<0.01) with respect to the complementary set of CNEs
                    (e.g., CNEs of cluster #3 genes versus CNEs of non-cluster #3 genes).

Results
rganization of the hx2 locus in vertebrates. We analyzed the Lhx2 locus in the completely sequenced genomes
                    of human, mouse, chicken and fugu. In human, mouse and chicken, the linkage of
                        Lhx2 and the two genes located upstream,
                        DENN/MADD-domain containing protein 1A
                        (Dennd1a) and Crumbs homolog 2
                        (Crb2), is conserved (Figure 1). In fugu, Lhx2 and
                        Crb2b are syntenic on scaffold_334 but
                        Dennd1a is missing. Incidentally, the single remaining copy
                    of Dennd1a in fugu is located on scaffold_128
                    and is linked to Crb2a. In addition, the genomic sequence on
                    fugu scaffold_334 is incomplete β�Ό58 kb downstream of
                        Lhx2.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.g001Figure 1Lhx2 gene loci in human, mouse, chicken and
                            fugu.Rectangles above the line indicate genes on the forward strand, while
                            rectangles below the line indicate genes on the reverse strand. Genes in
                            blue are syntenic in the 4 species. Not drawn to scale.The conserved synteny of the locus encompassing Crb2 and
                        Lhx2 in vertebrates such as tetrapods and fish, led us to
                    postulate that there may exist cis-regulatory elements in this
                    syntenic block of Crb2 and Lhx2 that regulate
                    the spatiotemporal expression of Lhx2 and also
                        Crb2 and Dennd1a located upstream. As
                    described by Kikuta et al. [40], genes that encode developmental TFs tend to be
                    embedded in regions of extensive conserved synteny known as β€�genomic
                    regulatory blocksβ€�, and their cis-regulatory elements can
                    be located far away, within or beyond neighbouring genes that are functionally
                    unrelated. Based on this concept, it was necessary to examine the expression
                    patterns of the adjacent genes Crb2 and
                        Dennd1a and investigate the possibility that
                        Crb2 and Dennd1a are regulated by CNEs
                    within the Crb2-Lhx2 conserved syntenic block.
                        Crb2 encodes two alternative isoforms, a transmembrane
                    protein and a secreted protein, that are calcium-ion binding and are implicated
                    in response to stimulus and visual perception. CRB2 is
                    expressed in adult human retina, brain, kidney, fetal eye and at lower levels in
                    the lung, placenta and heart [41]. In zebrafish, there
                    are two paralogs of the mammalian Crb2, oko
                        meduzy (ome) and crb2b. The
                        ome gene expresses in the developing brain and retina from
                    24β€“72 hpf and is essential for determining apico-basal polarity of neural
                    tube epithelial cells [42]. The crb2b gene expresses in the
                    immediate proximity of yolk sac and the pineal gland (epiphysis) from
                    24β€“48 hpf, and is highly enriched in the photoreceptor cell layer and
                    pronephros at 72 hpf. It determines apical surface size in photoreceptors and is
                    required for differentiation and motility of renal cilia [42]. Hence, because
                        Lhx2 and Crb2 express similarly in the
                    developing vertebrate brain and eye, there may also exist shared enhancers
                    within the Crb2-Lhx2 genomic region that direct expression of
                    these two genes. On the other hand, Dennd1a encodes connecdenn,
                    a component of the endocytic machinery with functions in synaptic vesicle
                    endocytosis [43]. Connecdenn possesses an N-terminal DENN domain that
                    is present in various signaling proteins involved in Rab-mediated processes or
                    the regulation of MAP kinase signaling pathways [44], and other domains that
                    enable it to bind clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and synaptic Src homology 3
                    (SH3)-domain proteins. Recent work has shown that connecdenn's DENN domain
                    acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab35 GTPase, enabling it to
                    promote cargo-selective recycling from early endosomes [45]. The expression of
                    connecdenn is preferentially high in the adult rat brain and testis, in
                    particular the membranes of neuronal clathrin-coated vesicles [43], and
                    relatively lower in liver, kidney, lung, heart and epididymis [46]. The
                    expression domains shared with Lhx2 (brain, liver) and
                        Crb2 (brain, kidney, lung, heart) might suggest that
                        Dennd1a could be co-regulated with Lhx2
                    and Crb2. However, Dennd1a has been lost from
                    the Crb2-Lhx2 conserved syntenic block in fugu, which implies
                    that it does not fall under the control of cis-regulatory
                    elements in the Crb2-Lhx2 region.Expression patterns of Lhx2, Crb2 and
                        Dennd1a in E11.5 mouse embryosWe determined the expression patterns of Lhx2,
                        Crb2 and Dennd1a genes in E11.5 mouse
                    embryos by whole-mount in situ hybridization. While the
                    expression pattern of mouse Lhx2 at E11.5 has been previously
                    been determined [16], [47], [48], to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of
                    the expression patterns of Crb2 and Dennd1a
                    genes in E11.5 mouse embryos. Our in situ hybridization showed
                    that at E11.5, Lhx2 is expressed in the telencephalon,
                    diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain, eye, dorsal neural tube and distal regions of
                    the limb buds (Figure 2A).
                    This is in accordance with what has been previously reported about
                        Lhx2 expression [14], [16], [47]. Crb2 and
                        Dennd1a are expressed in the forebrain, midbrain, and
                    hindbrain, which is strikingly similar to Lhx2. In addition,
                        Crb2 expresses in the eye. However, compared with
                        Lhx2, both genes are expressed more highly in the medial
                    regions of the telencephalon than in the lateral regions (Figure 2B and C) and do not express in the
                    neural tube or the distal region of the limb buds.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.g002Figure 2Expression of Lhx2, Crb2,

                            each gene and all embryos gave essentially the same results as these

                        Lhx2, we aligned the entire region of conserved synteny
                    beginning from the end of the gene upstream of Crb2 to the
                    start of the gene downstream of Lhx2 in human and mouse and the
                    end of scaffold_334 in fugu (see Figure 1) using MLAGAN [31] and predicted CNEs using
                    VISTA [32].
                    The length of this region is 989 kb in human, 808 kb in mouse and 186 kb in fugu
                        (Figure 3). Ten
                    human-fugu and mouse-fugu CNEs were identified using criteria β‰¥65%
                    identity over 50 bp and were numbered CNE1 to
                        CNE10 (Figure
                        4), beginning from the CNE that is located furthest from the
                    transcription start site of Lhx2. The CNEs are 51 bp to 243 bp
                    in length (average 115 bp), possess 65% to 90% sequence identity
                    (average 72% identity) and reside 219 kb to 619 kb upstream of human
                        LHX2, within the introns of the upstream gene

                    flanking sequence on either end of the CNE, and cloned upstream of a
                        lacZ reporter gene whose expression is driven by a mouse
                        hsp68 minimal promoter
                    (β€�pHsp68β€�). Transgenic mouse embryos were generated
                    and harvested at E11.5. The details of the CNE constructs tested in transgenic
                    mice are given in Table 1
                    and Table
                        S1. We studied the lacZ (Ξ²-galactosidase)
                    expression patterns that were directed under the control of each CNE. A CNE was
                    classified as a transcriptional enhancer if it directed reproducible reporter
                    gene expression in the same anatomical structure in at least three independent
                    transgenic mouse embryos.CNE1CNE1 is a 76-bp sequence located approximately 619 kb upstream
                    of human LHX2 within the 20th intron of
                        DENND1A. Altogether seven transgenic embryos were obtained
                    for CNE1 construct, of which four (57%) showed no
                        lacZ expression while three (43%) showed varying
                    patterns of lacZ expression (Figure S1).
                    Although two independent embryos showed similar expression in the dorsal root
                    ganglia (marked with red arrows in Figure S1), the number of transgenic embryos
                    displaying this pattern of expression is not sufficient for this CNE to be
                    classified as an enhancer. We therefore concluded that CNE1
                    does not act as a transcriptional enhancer at stage E11.5.CNE2/3CNE2/3 is a combination of two CNEs, CNE2 and
                        CNE3, which were tested together due to their close
                    proximity to each other (41 bp apart). These CNEs have a combined length of 210
                    bp, and are situated approximately 516 kb upstream of human
                        LHX2 in the 13th intron of
                        DENND1A. A total of six E11.5 transgenic embryos were
                    obtained for CNE2/3 construct, four (67%) of which
                    displayed reproducible expression in the neural tube and dorsal root ganglia
                        (Figure 6A and Figure S2)
                    while the remaining two embryos (33%) showed no expression. We therefore
                    conclude that CNE2/3 directs expression to neural tube and dorsal root ganglia
                    at E11.5. However, it should be noted that this expression pattern differs from
                        Lhx2 expression in the neural tube; while
                        lacZ appears to express in the ventral region of the neural

                    expresses in the dorsal region at E11.5. Furthermore, the dorsal root ganglion
                    is not a domain of Lhx2 expression.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.g006Figure 6Lhx2-associated CNEs direct expression to various

                                lacZ expression was detected in the diencephalon
                            for this embryo. Scale bar denotes 1 mm in length. M: midbrain; H:

                    of LHX2, within the fifth intron of DENND1A. A
                    total of five transgenic embryos were obtained for E11.5, but none of them
                    showed lacZ expression (data not shown). Hence,
                        CNE4 is not an enhancer at E11.5.CNE5/6CNE5/6 is a combination of two CNEs, CNE5 and
                        CNE6, that are 38 bp apart and are located approximately
                    269 kb upstream of human LHX2 within the fifth intron of
                        DENND1A. A 719-bp genomic fragment was amplified and cloned
                    for this construct, making it the longest element among all the constructs
                    tested. A total of five E11.5 transgenic embryos were obtained. Four
                    (80%) of these embryos had two lacZ-expressing
                    anatomical features in common - the hindbrain and the neural tube (Figure 6B and Figure S3A
                    β€“ C) while the fifth embryo showed nearly ubiquitous expression throughout
                    the entire head and the dorsal part of the embryo (Figure
                    S3D). CNE5/6 is classified as a transcriptional
                    enfhancer at E11.5 because it directs reproducible reporter gene expression to
                    similar embryonic regions in independent transgenic embryos. Although
                        CNE5/6 does not recapitulate the expression of
                        Lhx2 in the dorsal region of the neural tube, it does
                    partially recapiftulate the expression of Lhx2,
                        Crb2 and Dennd1a in the hindbrain.CNE7The 51-bp CNE7 is the shortest among all the 10 CNEs tested. The
                    orthologous sequences in human and fugu share 65% identity.
                        CNE7 is located in the third intron of
                        DENND1A, approximately 242 kb upstream of
                        LHX2 in human. When assayed in transgenic mice, this
                    construct directed reporter gene expression in the hindbrain and neural tube at
                    E11.5. Among a total of four transgenic embryos that were obtained, three
                    (75%) showed similar lacZ expression in the hindbrain
                    and neural tube (Figure 6C
                    and Figure
                        S4) while the remaining embryo did not display any expression. Hence,
                        CNE7 acts as a transcriptional enhancer at stage E11.5.
                    While CNE7 does not recapitulate Lhx2
                    expression in the dorsal region of the neural tube, it does partially
                    recapitulate Lhx2, Crb2 and
                        Dennd1a expression in the hindbrain.CNE8CNE8, like CNE7, resides in the third intron of
                        DENND1A, approximately 234 kb upstream of human
                        LHX2 gene. This CNE does not act as an enhancer at E11.5,
                    because no lacZ expression was detected in four out of the six
                    (67%) transgenic embryos obtained for this developmental stage. The
                    remainfing two embryos (33%) exhibited ectopic lacZ
                    expression in various anatomical structures with no reproducible similarities
                        (Figure
                        S5).CNE9CNE9 is a 53-bp element, the second shortest CNE after
                        CNE7, that is also located in the third intron of
                        DENND1A, approximately 222 kb upstream of human
                        LHX2. CNE9 was amplified and cloned as
                    part of a 261-bp insert fragment. When assayed in transgenic mice, a total of
                    eight transgenic embryos were obtained, half of which showed no expression (data
                    not shown) while three embryos showed ectopic expression in various tissues and
                    the final embryo expressed lacZ ubiquitously (Figure S6).
                    Hence, CNE9 does not act as an enhancer at E11.5.CNE10CNE10 is a 145-bp element that has the highest percentage
                    identity (β�Ό90%) in human and fugu among all the CNEs assayed.
                        CNE10 is located approximately 219 kb upstream of human
                        LHX2, immediately upstream of the third exon of
                        DENND1A. Because CNE10 encompasses a
                    splice site of DENND1A, it may be involved in the regulation of
                        DENND1A mRNA splicing. Nevertheless, we assayed this
                    element for enhancer activity in transgenic mice because the ortholog of
                        DENND1A is absent from the genomic region upstream of fugu
                        Lhx2 on scaffold_334 suggesting that the
                    CNE may have been retained during evolution due to selective pressure that arose
                    from an underlying cis-regulatory function. Indeed,
                        CNE10 was found to act as a transcriptional enhancer. Of
                    the total seven transgenic embryos obtained, three embryos (43%) showed
                    reproducible lacZ expression in essentially the same anatomical
                    features, the most rostral part of the midbrain, the hindbrain and the neural
                    tube (Figure 6D and Figure S7)
                    while two embryos showed ubiquitous lacZ expression throughout
                    the whole embryo and the remaining two embryos did not display any
                        lacZ expression. Although CNE10 does not
                    recapitulate Lhx2 expression in the dorsal region of the neural
                    tube at E11.5, it does partially recapitulate Lhx2,
                        Crb2 and Dennd1a expression in the
                    midbrain and hindbrain.Summary of the expression patterns of CNEsIn summary, four out of the eight elements (50%) that we assayed for
                    enhancer activity in transgenic mouse embryos, directed reproducible reporter
                    gene expression in specific tissues at E11.5 (Table 2). Elements CNE2/3,
                        CNE5/6, CNE7 and CNE10
                    directed lacZ expression to the neural tube with the latter
                    three also directing lacZ expression to the hindbrain. Thus
                    there was clear overlap in their domains of expression. In addition,
                        CNE2/3 induced lacZ expression in the
                    dorsal root ganglia while CNE10 extended lacZ
                    expression from the hindbrain into the ventral and most rostral regions of the
                    midbrain. Overall, these four elements partially recapitulate
                        Lhx2 expression in the midbrain and hindbrain, but do not
                    recapitulate the expression of Lhx2 in the forebrain, eye, limb
                    buds and dorsal neural tube at E11.5.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.t002Table 2Summary of the expression patterns directed by CNE

                    genes that express in central nervous systemTranscriptional enhancers typically comprise clusters of binding sites for
                    transcription factors (TFs). Since four of the Lhx2-associated
                    CNEs (CNE2/3, CNE5/6, CNE7 and CNE10) function as enhancers directing expression
                    to the central nervous system, we reasoned that they might be enriched for
                    motifs (binding sites of TFs) that mediate expression in the central nervous
                    system. Since four is a small number for predicting motifs, we decided to use
                    the large set of human-fugu CNEs (β�Ό3,000 elements that are at least
                    65% identical over 50 bp) that we have previously predicted in the
                    TF-encoding gene loci in human and fugu [49]. This is a comprehensive set
                    of CNEs associated with 718 human TF-encoding genes that have orthologs in fugu.
                    We first extracted the expression data for 718 human-fugu TF orthologs across 62
                    human tissues from GNF Human GeneAtlas v2 [36]. The gene expression profiles
                    were then clustered using the k-means clustering algorithm,
                    Cluster [38].
                    We experimented with different values of k and selected the
                    value kβ€�=β€�6 (resulting in six clusters)
                    for subsequent analysis because it performed best qualitatively. Figure 7A shows the heat maps
                    generated using TreeView (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm) and Figure 7B the corresponding average gene
                    expression levels for each of the 62 human tissues across the six clusters. The
                    CNE densities of genes in expression clusters #1, #3, #4 and #6 (Figure 7C) are higher than,
                    but not significantly different (P>0.01; Wilcoxon rank-sum
                    test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing) from, those in other
                    expression clusters. However, when the number of CNEs and total length of CNEs
                    per gene are considered, genes in cluster #3 have a significantly higher number
                    of CNEs (5.90 CNEs per gene, Pβ€�=β€�0.00983)
                    than genes in other clusters, although their total length is not significantly
                    high (total length 800 bp per gene,
                    Pβ€�=β€�0.0124) (Figure 7C). This cluster consists mainly of
                    genes that express highly in different regions of the brain (e.g., prefrontal
                    cortex, amygdala, whole brain) and spinal cord, which make up the central
                    nervous system. This suggests that TF-encoding genes that predominantly express
                    in the central nervous system contain higher numbers of CNEs compared to
                    TF-encoding genes that express in other tissues. This inference is in agreement
                    with our previous findings that genes that are involved in development, in
                    particular development of the central nervous system, are enriched with CNEs
                        [49]. In
                    addition, these results are consistent with the findings of Sironi et al. [50] that
                    central nervous system-expressed genes tend to be rich in CNEs while Pennacchio
                    et al. [29] who had verified β�Ό80 transcriptional enhancers in
                    developing mouse embryos, found that the enhancers directed reporter expression
                    most frequently in the brain and neural tube. More recently, a similar
                    association between ultraconserved noncoding elements (noncoding sequences
                    exceedingly conserved in human, chimp and mouse) and genes that preferentially
                    express in the central nervous system has been described [51]. Using the GNF Human
                    GeneAtlas, this study found that nine out of the ten tissues that express genes
                    most significantly associated with ultraconserved noncoding elements constitute
                    various members of the central nervous system.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.g007Figure 7TF-encoding genes predominantly expressed in the central nervous

                            respectively. (B) Each graph represents the average gene expression

                            of genes that predominantly express in the central nervous system. (C)
                            The table pertains to the CNE density (CNE bases per kb of noncoding
                            sequence in a human gene locus), the number and total length of CNEs per
                            TF-encoding gene in different expression clusters.The identification of a large number of CNEs (810 CNEs) associated with genes
                    that express in the central nervous system (cluster #3) (Figure 7B) allowed us to search for
                    over-represented motifs using the motif finding program, Weeder [39]. Comparison
                    of CNEs associated with cluster #3 genes and non-cluster #3 genes (810 CNEs of
                    117 genes vs. 1,684 CNEs of 601 genes) resulted in the detection of four
                    over-represented 8-mer motifs (P<0.01) (Table 3). These
                    over-represented motifs in CNEs of cluster #3 genes presumably represent binding
                    sites for TFs that are involved in directing expression of the target gene to
                    the central nervous system. Interestingly, all the four motifs contain the
                    β€�TAATβ€� motif characteristic of homeodomain TF binding sites (TFBS)
                        [52]. Two
                    of the motifs (motif #1, β€�ATTAACCGβ€™ and motif #4,
                    β€�TGATTACGβ€™) coincide with two pentamer motifs (β€�ATTAAβ€™
                    and β€�GATTAβ€™) previously reported to be enriched in four human-fugu
                    CNEs that drove reporter gene expression in the mouse forebrain [29]. Motif
                    #2 (β€�CTAATTAGβ€™) shares the β€�TAATTβ€™ sequence of
                    homeodomain TFBS, whose co-occurrence with SOX and POU TFBS in highly conserved
                    mammal-fugu CNEs was proposed to be associated with gene expression in the
                    central nervous system [53]. However, the motifs identified by Pennacchio et al.
                        [29]
                    and Bailey et al. [53] that coincide with our motifs, were not
                    experimentally tested for functional activity in the central nervous system.
                    Finally, a third study searched 13 forebrain enhancers conserved in human and
                    zebrafish and identified five hexamer motifs that were enriched [54]. Mutation of
                    the 5 motifs in some forebrain enhancers significantly reduced or altered
                    enhancer activity and hence these motifs were deduced to be critical for
                    forebrain enhancer activity. Our motif #3 (β€�CATTAGCGβ€™) partially
                    corresponds to one of their motifs β€�AATGGAβ€™.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.t003Table 3Over-represented 8-mer motifs in CNEs of cluster #3 genes.Known TFBSNo.Motif (and reverse-complement)No. of instancesP-valueSequenceTFReferences1ATTAACCG (CGGTTAAT)1591.1Γ—10β�’12ATGYTAATBrn2[64]2CTAATTAG (palindromic)2766.8Γ—10β�’8GCATAATTAATBrn3[65]TAATTAHoxB1, HoxB3[66]3CATTAGCG (CGCTAATG)985.2Γ—10β�’4CYYNATTAKYHoxA5[67]CATTAGIsl-1[68]4TGATTACG (CGTAATCA)1244.2Γ—10β�’3AATTAATCAAPit-1[69]Human-fugu CNEs of cluster #3 human transcription factor-encoding

                        3) which are implicated in the development of the nervous system
                        [55],
                        [56], [57], [58]. Thus, the
                    motifs we have found in the central nervous system CNEs are likely to be the
                    binding sites for TFs that mediate expression of genes in the central nervous
                    system. These motifs are putative targets for experimentally verifying TFBS in
                    CNEs and for identifying upstream regulators of the associated TF-encoding
                    gene.Besides cluster #3, genes of clusters #1 and #6 also display relatively high
                    numbers of CNEs although the association of these genes to presence of CNEs is
                    not statistically significant. Cluster #1 genes are expressed highly in the
                    human lung, placenta, prostate, thyroid and uterus (top five expression domains)
                        (Figure 7B). To the best
                    of our knowledge, these expression domains have not been previously associated
                    with enrichment of CNEs. Cluster #6 genes are expressed highly in the human
                    skeletal muscle, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, appendix and
                    uterus corpus (top five expression domains) (Figure 7B). Among the top 10 expression
                    domains, four tissues (superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, adrenal
                    cortex and ciliary ganglion) are derived from the neural crest. TF-encoding
                    genes such as Sox10
                    [59] and
                        Pax3
                    [60] are
                    known to be associated with conserved enhancers that mediate gene expression in
                    the neural crest or its derivatives. Despite having no significant enrichment of
                    CNEs, the genes in the expression clusters other than cluster #3 may still be
                    enriched for motifs that direct expression to the tissues characteristic of each
                    cluster. To obtain a more complete list of motifs enriched in all TF-encoding
                    genes, we searched the CNEs associated with the genes of the remaining
                    expression clusters and identified two to twelve motifs enriched in CNEs of each
                    cluster (Table
                        S2).Site-directed mutagenesis of a predicted motif in
                    CNE2/3Among the 10 CNEs predicted by us in the Lhx2 locus,
                        CNE2 contained 1 instance each of motifs #2 (with 1 base
                    mismatch) and #4 (2 mismatches) (Table 3); and CNE4 contained 1 instance each of
                    motifs #1 (2 mismatches) and #4 (2 mismatches). No other motif instance could be
                    found in these or the other CNEs. The locations of these putative motif
                    instances are shown in Figures S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S6, S17.
                    Interestingly, while CNE2 is part of the
                        CNE2/3 construct that directed expression to neural tube
                    and dorsal root ganglia, CNE4 did not drive expression of
                    reporter gene in transgenic mouse embryos at E11.5. This suggests that
                        CNE4 may be active in the central nervous system at some
                    other stage of development. Alternatively, motif #1 has occurred in this CNE by
                    chance and is not acting as a transcription factor binding site. The latter
                    hypothesis is more likely because the motif #1 instance is not conserved in fugu
                    (see Figure
                        S9). To determine if the motifs predicted in CNE2
                    are functional, we selected CNE2/3 construct, which directed
                    expression to the neural tube and dorsal root ganglia. This construct has two
                    motif instances β€�AGTAATTAβ€™ and
                        β€�GTAATTAGβ€™ that overlap each other (bases
                    that match motifs #4 and #2 are underlined) and are located at the 5β€² end
                    of CNE2 (Figure S9). We mutated the
                    β€�TAATTAβ€™ subsequence to β€�GGGGGGβ€™ (Figure 8A). We then tested the mutant
                    construct in transgenic mice at stage E11.5. A total of 13 transgenic embryos
                    were obtained. The expression in 3 embryos (23%) displayed
                        lacZ expression patterns that are faintly similar to but
                    significantly truncated compared with the expression pattern of the wild-type
                    construct (Figure
                    8Bβ€“F). Two embryos (15%) showed ubiquitous
                        lacZ expression throughout the entire embryo and notably,
                    while 8 embryos (62%) showed no lacZ expression. Hence,
                    through the mutation of the predicted motif, the enhancer activity of
                        CNE2/3 was either significantly reduced or completely
                    abolished.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.g008Figure 8Site-directed mutagenesis of overlapping motifs in

Discussion
n this study, we have used evolutionary constraint as an indicator for identifying
                conserved enhancers directing the expression of hx2 gene. y
                aligning hx2 locus from distantly related vertebrates such as
                human and fugu, we identified 10 s in the greater hx2 locus
                that encompasses three genes. e tested the 10 s as a set of eight constructs in
                transgenic mice and found that four elements confer restricted expression patterns
                in transgenic mouse embryos at 11.5. hese four s directed reporter gene
                expression to mainly the hindbrain and the neural tube, partially recapitulating the
                endogenous expression pattern of hx2 at 11.5. n addition, one of
                these s (10) directed reporter expression to the
                rostroventral midbrain while another  (2/3) induced reporter
                expression in the dorsal root ganglia. s for the four s that did not display
                specific spatiotemporal reporter gene expression, they may direct expression at
                other stages of development or they may act as transcriptional silencers instead of
                enhancers, and therefore would not be detected by the minimal promoter-reporter
                construct used.
hx2 is located within a conserved syntenic block that spans at
                least 14 genes in tetrapods (igure
                    1). owever, the conserved syntenic block covers only three genes in
                mammals and fish, namely rb2, ennd1a and
                    hx2. urthermore, the duplicated copy of the intervening gene
                    ennd1a has been lost in the fugu
                    rb2-hx2 locus. he
                    rb2-hx2 is reminiscent of β€�genomic regulatory
                blocksβ€� (s) previously described by ikuta et al. (2007) based on conserved
                syntenic blocks of genes and s in mammals and teleost fishes. s are long-range
                conserved syntenic regions characterized by the presence of s and their target
                genes in addition to β€�bystanderβ€� genes that are specifically not under
                the control of the s. onsequently, the bystander genes can be β€�lostβ€�
                from the s in some species such as teleosts that have experienced a
                β€�fish-specificβ€� whole-genome duplication. he loss of the duplicated
                    ennd1a in the fugu rb2-hx2 locus indicates
                that this could be a bystander gene in this locus. he four s that were showed to
                be functional enhancers in our transgenic mouse assay directed expression, among
                other domains, to the midbrain and hindbrain. ince both rb2 and
                    hx2 are expressed in these domains in mouse embryos at 11.5,
                it is possible that these s may be directing the expression of
                    hx2 and/or rb2. nterestingly all four
                functional s have one expression domain in common β€“ the full length of the
                neural tube, in particular the ventral region. ince both hx2 and
                    rb2 are not expressed in this domain, the possibility remains
                that these enhancers may be directing the expression of other genes, possibly those
                located downstream of hx2 for which we have not yet determined to
                be syntenic in fishes and mammals. n alternative possibility is that the hx2 locus
                may contain silencers that repress the expression of hx2 and
                    rb2 in the ventral region of the neural tube.
y identifying a large number of s associated with  encoding-genes that
                predominantly express in the central nervous system, we predicted motifs that are
                over-represented in such s. e then hypothesized that motifs may represent
                -binding sites that are essential for directing expression to the central nervous
                system. e tested this hypothesis through site-directed mutagenesis of a predicted
                motif instance, motif #2, in 2/3, that directed expression to
                the neural tube. utation of the motif β€�β€™ in this  resulted in
                the abolition of reporter gene expression in the neural tube. his indicates that
                the motif is necessary for the 2/3 enhancer to direct gene
                expression to the neural tube. his motif shares the β€�β€™ sequence
                with the homeodomain binding model by ailey et al. [53] and a forebrain-associated
                motif of ennacchio et al. [29]. owever in these studies, the motifs were not tested for
                functional activity in the central nervous system. e have now tested and provided
                experimental evidence that motif #2 is indeed necessary for expression in the neural
                tube. nterestingly, 2/3 also directed expression to the dorsal
                root ganglia which is part of the peripheral nervous system, and mutation of motif
                #2 in this construct resulted in abolition of expression in this domain. hese
                results suggest that motif #2 also plays a role driving expression in the peripheral
                nervous system in the embryo.
ut of the four s that showed expression in the central nervous system and the
                dorsal root ganglia, three showed overlapping expression in the hindbrain and all
                showed similar expression in the neural tube. hese overlapping expression patterns
                of the different enhancers suggest that they are either associated with different
                genes in this locus or alternatively, redundant enhancers of the same gene. imilar
                enhancers showing overlapping patterns of expression have been previously identified
                in the screening of mammal-chicken s in the ox10 locus [59] and in a 1-b
                region surrounding the hh locus [61]. uch apparently redundant
                enhancers are believed to be retained to ensure robust and high levels of expression
                of target genes and/or to serve as templates for evolution of novel enhancers.
                nterestingly, based on studies in rosophila, some apparently
                redundant enhancers have been found to be essential for survival in extreme
                conditions because they maintain optimal levels of target gene expression and confer
                phenotypic robustness [62], [63]. or example, deletion of two enhancers that direct
                    shavenbaby expression in overlapping domains in
                    rosophila results in only minor defects in trichome
                development under normal conditions, whereas a significant loss of trichomes is
                observed at extreme temperatures [62]. uch apparently redundant enhancers have been termed as
                β€�shadowβ€� or secondary enhancers which function in concert with primary
                enhancers that reside closer to the target gene. t remains to be seen if the
                apparently redundant enhancers identified in the hx2 locus act as
                shadow enhancers.
s the four functional s that we have identified in the hx2
                locus do not direct expression to the forebrain, eye, limb buds and dorsal neural
                tube in which hx2 normally expresses at 11.5, additional analyses
                have to be conducted to identify the complete repertoire of
                cis-regulatory elements that recapitulate the full expression
                pattern of hx2. t is possible that some
                cis-regulatory elements that direct specific spatiotemporal
                expression of hx2 lie outside the locus studied. lternatively,
                the cis-regulatory elements present within the genomic region we
                have analyzed are divergent in mammals and fish and cannot be detected by human-fish
                sequence comparisons. omparisons among several mammalian species may help to
                identify such lineage-specific enhancers.Discussion
In this study, we have used evolutionary constraint as an indicator for identifying
                conserved enhancers directing the expression of Lhx2 gene. By
                aligning Lhx2 locus from distantly related vertebrates such as
                human and fugu, we identified 10 CNEs in the greater Lhx2 locus
                that encompasses three genes. We tested the 10 CNEs as a set of eight constructs in
                transgenic mice and found that four elements confer restricted expression patterns
                in transgenic mouse embryos at E11.5. These four CNEs directed reporter gene
                expression to mainly the hindbrain and the neural tube, partially recapitulating the
                endogenous expression pattern of Lhx2 at E11.5. In addition, one of
                these CNEs (CNE10) directed reporter expression to the
                rostroventral midbrain while another CNE (CNE2/3) induced reporter
                expression in the dorsal root ganglia. As for the four CNEs that did not display
                specific spatiotemporal reporter gene expression, they may direct expression at
                other stages of development or they may act as transcriptional silencers instead of
                enhancers, and therefore would not be detected by the minimal promoter-reporter
                construct used.
Lhx2 is located within a conserved syntenic block that spans at
                least 14 genes in tetrapods (Figure
                    1). However, the conserved syntenic block covers only three genes in
                mammals and fish, namely Crb2, Dennd1a and
                    Lhx2. Furthermore, the duplicated copy of the intervening gene
                    Dennd1a has been lost in the fugu
                    Crb2-Lhx2 locus. The
                    Crb2-Lhx2 is reminiscent of β€�genomic regulatory
                blocksβ€� (GRBs) previously described by Kikuta et al. (2007) based on conserved
                syntenic blocks of genes and CNEs in mammals and teleost fishes. GRBs are long-range
                conserved syntenic regions characterized by the presence of CNEs and their target
                genes in addition to β€�bystanderβ€� genes that are specifically not under
                the control of the CNEs. Consequently, the bystander genes can be β€�lostβ€�
                from the GRBs in some species such as teleosts that have experienced a
                β€�fish-specificβ€� whole-genome duplication. The loss of the duplicated
                    Dennd1a in the fugu Crb2-Lhx2 locus indicates
                that this could be a bystander gene in this locus. The four CNEs that were showed to
                be functional enhancers in our transgenic mouse assay directed expression, among
                other domains, to the midbrain and hindbrain. Since both Crb2 and
                    Lhx2 are expressed in these domains in mouse embryos at E11.5,
                it is possible that these CNEs may be directing the expression of
                    Lhx2 and/or Crb2. Interestingly all four
                functional CNEs have one expression domain in common β€“ the full length of the
                neural tube, in particular the ventral region. Since both Lhx2 and
                    Crb2 are not expressed in this domain, the possibility remains
                that these enhancers may be directing the expression of other genes, possibly those
                located downstream of Lhx2 for which we have not yet determined to
                be syntenic in fishes and mammals. An alternative possibility is that the Lhx2 locus
                may contain silencers that repress the expression of Lhx2 and
                    Crb2 in the ventral region of the neural tube.
By identifying a large number of CNEs associated with TF encoding-genes that
                predominantly express in the central nervous system, we predicted motifs that are
                over-represented in such CNEs. We then hypothesized that motifs may represent
                TF-binding sites that are essential for directing expression to the central nervous
                system. We tested this hypothesis through site-directed mutagenesis of a predicted
                motif instance, motif #2, in CNE2/3, that directed expression to
                the neural tube. Mutation of the motif β€�TAATTAβ€™ in this CNE resulted in
                the abolition of reporter gene expression in the neural tube. This indicates that
                the motif is necessary for the CNE2/3 enhancer to direct gene
                expression to the neural tube. This motif shares the β€�TAATTβ€™ sequence
                with the homeodomain binding model by Bailey et al. [53] and a forebrain-associated
                motif of Pennacchio et al. [29]. However in these studies, the motifs were not tested for
                functional activity in the central nervous system. We have now tested and provided
                experimental evidence that motif #2 is indeed necessary for expression in the neural
                tube. Interestingly, CNE2/3 also directed expression to the dorsal
                root ganglia which is part of the peripheral nervous system, and mutation of motif
                #2 in this construct resulted in abolition of expression in this domain. These
                results suggest that motif #2 also plays a role driving expression in the peripheral
                nervous system in the embryo.
Out of the four CNEs that showed expression in the central nervous system and the
                dorsal root ganglia, three showed overlapping expression in the hindbrain and all
                showed similar expression in the neural tube. These overlapping expression patterns
                of the different enhancers suggest that they are either associated with different
                genes in this locus or alternatively, redundant enhancers of the same gene. Similar
                enhancers showing overlapping patterns of expression have been previously identified
                in the screening of mammal-chicken CNEs in the Sox10 locus [59] and in a 1-Mb
                region surrounding the Shh locus [61]. Such apparently redundant
                enhancers are believed to be retained to ensure robust and high levels of expression
                of target genes and/or to serve as templates for evolution of novel enhancers.
                Interestingly, based on studies in Drosophila, some apparently
                redundant enhancers have been found to be essential for survival in extreme
                conditions because they maintain optimal levels of target gene expression and confer
                phenotypic robustness [62], [63]. For example, deletion of two enhancers that direct
                    shavenbaby expression in overlapping domains in
                    Drosophila results in only minor defects in trichome
                development under normal conditions, whereas a significant loss of trichomes is
                observed at extreme temperatures [62]. Such apparently redundant enhancers have been termed as
                β€�shadowβ€� or secondary enhancers which function in concert with primary
                enhancers that reside closer to the target gene. It remains to be seen if the
                apparently redundant enhancers identified in the Lhx2 locus act as
                shadow enhancers.
As the four functional CNEs that we have identified in the Lhx2
                locus do not direct expression to the forebrain, eye, limb buds and dorsal neural
                tube in which Lhx2 normally expresses at E11.5, additional analyses
                have to be conducted to identify the complete repertoire of
                cis-regulatory elements that recapitulate the full expression
                pattern of Lhx2. It is possible that some
                cis-regulatory elements that direct specific spatiotemporal
                expression of Lhx2 lie outside the locus studied. Alternatively,
                the cis-regulatory elements present within the genomic region we
                have analyzed are divergent in mammals and fish and cannot be detected by human-fish
                sequence comparisons. Comparisons among several mammalian species may help to
                identify such lineage-specific enhancers.
