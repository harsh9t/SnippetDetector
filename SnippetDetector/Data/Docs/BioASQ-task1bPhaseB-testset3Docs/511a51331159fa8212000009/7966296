KP4 is a virally encoded and highly specific toxin that kills fungi closely related to the fungus Ustilago maydis. The toxin was purified and crystals were formed using ammonium sulfate as precipitant. The crystals belong to the space group P6(1)(5)22 and diffracted to approximately 2.2 A resolution. Circular dicroism spectroscopy suggests that the protein is predominantly comprised of beta-strands.
