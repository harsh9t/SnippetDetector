We describe a case of quick recovery of myocardium damage in a 15-year-old adolescent with subacute thyroiditis. After 1 week of admission, his cardiovascular status began to show signs of improvement accompanied by the recovery of electrocardiogram and indicators of myocardial damage. We speculate that myocardium damage associated with subacute thyroiditis is a complication of common virus, although we did not detect any abnormal virus antibody and deoxyribonucleic acid in the patient's serum.
