The present study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of human recombinant interferons (r-Hu-IFN) alpha and gamma, and that of highly purified natural human interferon beta on the replication of simian foamy virus type 1 (SFV1) in human AV3-cell cultures. All IFN led to strong inhibition of the SFV1 cytopathic effect. Electron microscopy showed a 70 to 95% decrease in viral particles. Significant inhibition of virus-associated reverse transcriptase activity was found in supernatant fluids of infected IFN-treated cultures. Metabolic labelling of the virus confirmed the inhibition of extracellular release of SFV1. PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitates indicated a reduction in viral-specific protein bands. Altogether, these results indicate that the mechanism of inhibition of Spumavirinae infection by interferon differs from that described for the other Retroviridae, and particularly for types B, C and D viruses. Our data is of therapeutic interest since Spumavirinae have been linked to pathological processes such as de Quervain thyroiditis.
