Chronic hepatitis C virus infection may be associated with extrahepatic manifestations. Thyroid disease related to chronic hepatitis C virus infection has been associated with interferon-alpha treatment. We present the case of a 40-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, who developed subacute thyroiditis during treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin.
