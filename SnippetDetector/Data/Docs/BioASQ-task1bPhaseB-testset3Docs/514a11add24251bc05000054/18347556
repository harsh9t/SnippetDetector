Advances in breast cancer research have confirmed that this malignancy is not a single disease, but rather a collection of genetically distinct diseases with different treatment requirements. In recent years, several studies have confirmed the clinical validity of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay, not only as a way to predict recurrence but also as a tool for determining therapeutic benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Recently, Drs. Terry Mamounas, G. Thomas Budd, and Kathy Miller answered questions about the Oncotype DX assay that are particularly relevant to routine clinical practice. This expert dialog provides a useful update and essential clinical insights about how, why, and when community oncologists may want to incorporate this multi-gene assay into their care of breast cancer patients. In addition, sample case studies offer tangible examples of the practical application of Oncotype DX.
