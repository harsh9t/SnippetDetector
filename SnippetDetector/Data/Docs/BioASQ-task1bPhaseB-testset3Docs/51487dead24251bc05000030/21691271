Pharmacogenomic tests offer a promising strategy to improve the safety and efficacy of drug treatment. Compelling examples, such as HLA-B*5701 testing to identify patients at risk for abacavir-associated hypersensitivity, are already changing clinical care. However, the level of evidence required to establish clinical utility is often the subject of debate. Determining the most efficient and effective pathway to benefit for a given test is therefore both a practical and an ethical concern.
