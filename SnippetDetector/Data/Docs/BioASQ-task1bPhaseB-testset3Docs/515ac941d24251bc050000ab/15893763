Thyroid hormone (TH) induces marked changes in the biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle affecting its bioenergetics, contractility and structure. Using a time-course analysis of in vitro treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with triiodothyronine (T3), mitochondrial biogenesis, functional bioenergetics and cardiomyocyte hypertrophic phenotype were assessed. Activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha), were significantly elevated with 72 h T3 treatment. A time-course analysis showed an early increase (between 3 and 12 h) in activity and levels of subunits of complex IV and V, mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and a late increase (at 72 h) in complex II and CS activities, mitochondrial protein content and mitochondrial respiration. Based on overall protein content and specific peptide levels (e.g. actin or myosin) only mild cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was detected. T3 mediates an early stimulation of enzymes containing mtDNA encoded subunits (e.g. complex IV and V) in contrast to a different regulatory pattern for the entirely nuclear-encoded enzymes (e.g. CS and complex II). T3-regulation was similar in both neonatal and young adult cardiomyocytes (ARCM) but absent in the senescent cardiomyocytes. This model offer an opportunity to study the rapid timing of events involved in myocardial cell signaling, bioenergetics and growth dynamics in a timeframe not available with whole animal studies.
