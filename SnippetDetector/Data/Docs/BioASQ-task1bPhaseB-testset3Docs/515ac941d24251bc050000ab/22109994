In vertebrates, skeletal muscle myofibers display different contractile and metabolic properties associated with different mitochondrial content and activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) regulating mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. When overexpressed in skeletal muscle, it increases mitochondrial DNA content, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, and induces a shift in the metabolic and contractile features of muscle fibers toward a slower and more oxidative phenotype. Here we show that a p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle in association with the induction of a more glycolytic muscle phenotype and a decrease of capillary density. In addition, p43(-/-) mice displayed a significant increase in muscle mass relative to control animals and had an improved ability to use lipids. Our findings establish that the p43 mitochondrial receptor strongly affects muscle mass and the metabolic and contractile features of myofibers and provides evidence that this receptor mediates, in part, the influence of thyroid hormone in skeletal muscle.
