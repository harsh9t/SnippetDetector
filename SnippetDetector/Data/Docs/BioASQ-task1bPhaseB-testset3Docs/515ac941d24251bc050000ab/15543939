Changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle impacting metabolic rate, contractility and structural hypertrophy. Using an in vivo model of chronic treatment with thyroid hormone (T4, 0.3 mg/kg/day), we evaluated how mitochondria are regulated in response to T4, and assessed the relationship of T4-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics to overall cardiac hypertrophy. The role of thyroid hormone in cardiac bioenergetic remodeling was addressed in rats treated with T4 for 5, 10 and 15 days. Over that time, myocardial oxygen consumption substantially increased as did cardiac hypertrophy. Myocardial levels of mitochondrial enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), specific proteins and transcript were assessed. Activity levels of respiratory complexes I-V and citrate synthase significantly increased with 15 but not with 5 or 10-day T4 treatment. Myocardial levels of mtDNA, mitochondrial proteins (e.g. cytochrome c, cytochrome b, ATPase subunits, MnSOD) and the global transcription factor PPARalpha were significantly elevated with 15-day T4. Transcript analysis revealed increased expression of transcription factors and cofactors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis including PPARalpha, mtTFA, ErbAalpha and PGC-1alpha. Our findings indicate parallel increases in myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis with 15-day T4; these changes were not present with 10-day T4 even with significant cardiac hypertrophy. The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.
