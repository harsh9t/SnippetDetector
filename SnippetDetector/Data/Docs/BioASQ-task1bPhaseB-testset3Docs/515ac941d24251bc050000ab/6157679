The purpose of this investigation was to study the effects of thyroid hormone treatment on the levels of DNA, RNA, and protein in hepatocytes and hepatocyte mitochondria. A preliminary investigation was conducted to establish an effective dosage of thyroid hormone. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given daily subcutaneous injections of L-thyroxine (20, 40, or 60 micrograms/100 g body weight) and the following determinations made over a 14-day period: (1) body weight; (2) total body respiration; and (3) the activities of the mitochondrial enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. Dosages of 20 and 40 micrograms L-thyroxine/200 g body weight produced significant stimulation of (a) total body respiration and (b) succinate dehydrogenase and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities without any inhibitory effects on normal weight gain of the animals. Injections of 40 micrograms L-thyroxine/100 g body weight were utilized for subsequent studies. Hepatic DNA levels of treated animals were greater than age-paired control values by 28% on day 7 and 43% by day 14. Total liver RNA levels of thyroid-treated animals were 17% greater than those of controls by day 7 and 47% greater by day 14. Analyses were also performed on mitochondria quantitatively collected by rate zonal centrifugation. Total liver mitochondrial DNA levels in thyroid-treated animals were greater than age-paired controls by 79% at 7 days but only 67% at 14 days since a small gain occurred in control animals and no further increase occurred in treated rats during the second week. Mitochondrial RNA and protein from treated livers were 26% and 16% higher, respectively, than age-paired controls at day 7 and 40% and 58% higher, respectively, at day 14. The results of this study indicated that thyroid hormone treatment produces hyperplasia and an increase in mitochondrial number and mass in rat liver.
