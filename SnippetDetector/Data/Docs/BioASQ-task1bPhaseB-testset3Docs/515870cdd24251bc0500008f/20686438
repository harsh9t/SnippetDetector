Pediatric patients are rarely infected with metallo-β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We describe 3 cases of children infected with VIM-1-producing clonal Enterobacter cloacae. Patients were treated with amikacin and cotrimoxazole. The blaVIM-1 gene was carried into a class 1 integron and an IncHI2 incompatibility group plasmid. Emergence of pediatric infections caused by carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a critical issue as they are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics.
