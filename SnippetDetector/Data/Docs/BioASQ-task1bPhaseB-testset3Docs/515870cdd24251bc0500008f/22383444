The Check-MDR CT102 DNA microarray enables detection of the most prevalent carbapenemases (NDM, VIM, KPC, OXA-48 and IMP) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) gene families (SHV, TEM and CTX-M). The test performance of this microarray was evaluated with 95 Enterobacteriaceae isolates suspected of being carbapenemase producers, i.e. with meropenem MICs ≥0.5 mg l(-1). The collection of isolates contained 70 carbapenemase-producing isolates, including 37 bla(KPC)-, 20 bla(VIM)-, five bla(OXA-48)-, four bla(KPC)/bla(VIM)- and four bla(NDM)-positive isolates; and 25 carbapenemase-gene-negative isolates. ESBLs were produced by 51 of the isolates. PCR and sequencing of β-lactamase genes was used as reference test. For detection of carbapenemases, the sensitivity of the microarray was 97% (68/70), with 100% specificity. The two negative isolates tested positive when the microarray test was repeated; these isolates were an OXA-48- and a KPC-producing isolate. For ESBL detection, the sensitivity was 100% (51/51) and the specificity was 98% (43/44), although 20% of the SHV-12 ESBLs were categorized as SHV-2-like ESBLs. In conclusion, the CDT102 microarray is a rapid and accurate tool for the detection of carbapenemase and ESBL genes, although the array seems less suitable for epidemiology of ESBL genes.
