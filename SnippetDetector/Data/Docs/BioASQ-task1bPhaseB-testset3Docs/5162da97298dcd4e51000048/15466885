The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 receptor (5-HT4R) is involved in learning, feeding, respiratory control and gastrointestinal transit. This receptor is one of the G-protein-coupled receptors for which alternative mRNA splicing generates the most variants that differ in their C-terminal extremities. Some 5-HT4R variants (a, e and f) express canonical PDZ ligands at their C-termini. Here, we have examined whether some mouse 5-HT4R variants associate with specific sets of proteins, using a proteomic approach based on peptide-affinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. We have identified ten proteins that interact specifically with the 5-HT4(a)R and three that only associate with the 5-HT4(e)R. Most of them are PDZ proteins. Among the proteins that associated specifically with the 5-HT4(a)R variant, NHERF greatly modified its subcellular localization. Moreover, NHERF recruited the 5-HT4(a)R to microvilli, where it localized with activated ezrin, consistent with the role of 5-HT4(a)R in cytoskeleton remodelling. The 5-HT4(a)R also interacted with both the constitutive and inducible (upon methamphetamine treatment) forms of the recently cloned sorting nexin 27 (SNX27a and b, respectively). We found that SNX27a redirected part of 5-HT4(a)R to early endosomes. The interaction of the 5-HT4R splice variants with distinct sets of PDZ proteins might specify their cellular localization as well as their signal transduction properties.
