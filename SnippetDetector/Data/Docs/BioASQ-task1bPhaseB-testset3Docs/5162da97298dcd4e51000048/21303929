Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) belongs to the sorting nexin family of proteins, which participate in vesicular and protein trafficking. Similarly to all sorting nexin proteins, SNX27 has a functional PX domain that is important for endosome binding, but it is the only sorting nexin with a PDZ domain. We identified SNX27 as a partner of diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), a negative regulator of T cell function that metabolises diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid. SNX27 interacts with the DGKζ PDZ-binding motif in early/recycling endosomes in resting T cells; however, the dynamics and mechanisms underlying SNX27 subcellular localisation during T cell activation are unknown. We demonstrate that in T cells that encounter pulsed antigen-presenting cells, SNX27 in transit on early/recycling endosomes polarise to the immunological synapse. A fraction of SNX27 accumulates at the mature immunological synapse in a process that is dependent on vesicular trafficking, binding of the PX domain to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and the presence of the PDZ region. Downmodulation of expression of either SNX27 or DGKζ results in enhanced basal and antigen-triggered ERK phosphorylation. These results identify SNX27 as a PDZ-containing component of the T cell immunological synapse, and demonstrate a role for this protein in the regulation of the Ras-ERK pathway, suggesting a functional relationship between SNX27 and DGKζ.
