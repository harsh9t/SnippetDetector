Iodothyronine deiodinase in vitro activity studies in the chicken showed the presence of type I and type III iodothyronine deiodinase activity in both liver and kidney. Due to the lack of a specific antiserum the cellular localization of the deiodinase proteins could not be revealed until now. In the present study, specific antisera were used to study the renal and hepatic distribution of type I and type III iodothyronine deiodinase protein in the chicken. Immunocytochemical staining of liver tissue led to an immunopositive signal in the hepatocytes in general. Moreover, a zonal distribution could be detected for both enzymes. Maximum protein expression was shown in a thin layer of hepatocytes bordering the blood veins. Although pericentral localization of type I deiodinase protein has been previously reported in the rat, no data were given concerning type III deiodinase protein. In the present study, we report the co-localization of both enzymes in the chicken. Co-expression of the deiodinases was also found in the kidney. Expression of both proteins was associated with the tubular epithelial cells and with the transitional epithelium, and the inner longitudinal and outer circular muscle layers of the ureter. No staining could be detected in the lamina propria or in the fat tissue surrounding the ureter.
