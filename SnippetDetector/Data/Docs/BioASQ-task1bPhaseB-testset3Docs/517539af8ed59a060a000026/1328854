In order to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the muscle-specific subunit of the human phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-M) gene, chimeric genes composed of the upstream region of the PGAM-M gene and the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were constructed and transfected into C2C12 skeletal myocytes, primary cultured cardiac muscle cells, and C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. The expression of chimeric reporter genes was restricted in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. In C2C12 myotubes and primary cultured cardiac muscle cells, the segment between nucleotides -165 and +41 relative to the transcription initiation site was sufficient to confer maximal CAT activity. This region contains two E boxes and one MEF-2 motif. Deletion and substitution mutation analysis showed that a single MEF-2 motif but not the E boxes had a substantial effect on skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific enhancer activity and that the cardiac muscle-specific negative regulatory region was located between nucleotides -505 and -165. When the PGAM-M gene constructs were cotransfected with MyoD into C3H10T1/2, the profile of CAT activity was similar to that observed in C2C12 myotubes. Gel mobility shift analysis revealed that when the nuclear extracts from skeletal and cardiac muscle cells were used, the PGAM-M MEF-2 site generated the specific band that was inhibited by unlabeled PGAM-M MEF-2 and muscle creatine kinase MEF-2 oligomers but not by a mutant PGAM-M MEF-2 oligomer. These observations define the PGAM-M enhancer as the only cardiac- and skeletal-muscle-specific enhancer characterized thus far that is mainly activated through MEF-2.
