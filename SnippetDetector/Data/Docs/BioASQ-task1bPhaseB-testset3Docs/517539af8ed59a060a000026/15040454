The changes in the expression of muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene in the heart and skeletal muscle of mice during aging were studied. Its expression declines as a function of age in the heart, however, no age-related change is observed in the skeletal muscle. The cis-acting elements, MEF-2, E boxes and A/T rich elements present in the enhancer region of the mouse MCK gene are known to regulate the expression of the gene. Hence, these elements were subcloned and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out to investigate the changes in the binding of the nuclear trans-acting protein factors of the heart with these elements as a function of age. These factors showed specificity for the respective cis-acting elements. Furthermore, the binding of these factors was found to decrease during aging which may contribute to the age-related decline in the expression of the MCK gene and activity of the heart.
