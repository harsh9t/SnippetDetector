BACKGROUND: RET germline mutations predispose to the development of inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Several variants of the RET proto-oncogene including G691S and S904S have been suggested to act as genetic modifiers at the age of onset ofMEN2. AIM: The aim of this study is to characterize clinically and molecularly 7 Cypriot patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and 1 with MEN2A and also to determine the allelic frequencies of the RET variants G691S and S904S. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven probands from FMTC families and 1 from MEN2A were screened for the presence of RET mutations and the G691S and S904S variants. Additionally, 226 healthy Cypriots, who served as controls were analysed in an attempt to compare the frequencies of G691S and S904S RET variants to those observed in the 8 patients. RESULTS: The clinical diagnosis of the probands was based on clinical presentation and supported with biochemical findings. The germline C618R mutation of exon 10 was identified in all 8 probands and in 15 relatives from 7 different families. No significant difference in the G691S/S904S variants allele frequencies between patients (4/16 or 25%) and controls (124/452 or 27.4%) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) unrelated Cypriot patients which may be explained by a founder effect. Additionally, no association of the G691S/S904S variants was linked with the disease.
