Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by deleterious mutations within the RET protooncogene. MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16. Our group has developed the publicly available, searchable MEN2 RET database to aid in genotype/phenotype correlations, using Human Genome Variation Society recommendations for sequence variation nomenclature and database content. The MEN2 RET database catalogs all RET sequence variation relevant to the MEN2 syndromes, with associated clinical information. Each database entry lists a RET sequence variation's location within the RET gene, genotype, pathogenicity classification, MEN2 phenotype, first literature reference, and comments (which may contain information on other clinical features, complex genotypes, and additional literature references). The MEN2 phenotype definitions were derived from the International RET Mutation Consortium guidelines for classification of MEN2 disease phenotypes. Although nearly all of the 132 RET sequence variation entries initially cataloged in the database were from literature reports, novel sequence variation and updated phenotypic information for any existing database entry can be submitted electronically on the database website. The database website also contains links to selected MEN2 literature reviews, gene and protein information, and RET reference sequences. The MEN2 RET database (www.arup.utah.edu/database/MEN2/MEN2_welcome.php) will serve as a repository for MEN2-associated RET sequence variation and reference for RET genotype/MEN2 phenotype correlations.
