A requirement for integrin-mediated adhesion in cardiac physiology is revealed through targeted deletion of integrin-associated genes in the murine heart. Here we show that targeted ablation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression results in spontaneous cardiomyopathy and heart failure by 6 wk of age. Deletion of ILK results in disaggregation of cardiomyocytes, associated with disruption of adhesion signaling through the beta1-integrin/FAK (focal adhesion kinase) complex. Importantly, the loss of ILK is accompanied by a reduction in cardiac Akt phosphorylation, which normally provides a protective response against stress. Together, these results suggest that ILK plays a central role in protecting the mammalian heart against cardiomyopathy and failure.
