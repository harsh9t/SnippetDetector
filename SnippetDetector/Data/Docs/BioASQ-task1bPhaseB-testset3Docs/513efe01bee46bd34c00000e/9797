New data on viruses isolated from patients with subacute thyroiditis de Quervain are reported. Characteristic morphological, cytological, some physico-chemical and biological features of the isolated viruses are described. A possible role of these viruses in human and animal health disorders is discussed. The isolated viruses remain unclassified so far.
