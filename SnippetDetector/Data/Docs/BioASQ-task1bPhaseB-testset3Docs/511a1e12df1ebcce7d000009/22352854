Introduction
roteomics has emerged as a valuable tool
for the identification
of biomarkers associated with human disease1 including those resulting from very subtle changes in normal cell
functions and signaling pathways. roteomic technology has advanced
to a state where thousands of proteins can be identified within complex
samples,2β�’6 yet disease-based studies using fresh or frozen tissues are limited
by a lack of available specimens for longitudinal clinical investigations.
n contrast, there are millions of archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
() tissues for which the clinical course of disease and response
to therapy has been established.  tissue studies are affected
greatly by sample collection, tissue processing, and archival time.7 hough these factors are difficult to control
in archival samples, improvements in techniques such as m. TRAQ have
made relative quantitation of disease biomarkers in FFPE tissue possible.8,9 Improving protein extraction and detection of less abundant protein
biomarkers is also of critical importance in proteomic analysis. Protein
modifications by formaldehyde treatment and histological processing10,11 significantly limit the use FFPE tissues for proteomic analyses.
This has prevented proteomic studies of the clinical course of diseases,
such as prostate and breast cancer, that evolve slowly or where the
time between treatment and recurrence is long. Coupling proteomic
investigations with the retrospective pathology information available
from archival FFPE tissues would produce a wealth of practical information
on human diseases.
A variety of methods for profiling FFPE tissue
have been employed
recently. Some are practical for slide-mounted FFPE tissue, such as
quantitative fluorescence imaging analysis (QFIA), which is reproducible
and sensitive for specific standardized proteins,12β�’14 or MALDI-imaging
mass spectrometry (MS).15β�’17 Other encouraging mass spectrometry
(MS)-based proteomic studies of FFPE tissues have appeared in the
recent literature;2β�’7,9,18β�’20 however, these investigations have typically been
restricted to minute tissue specimens, such as those obtained by laser
capture microdissection. Further, some studies report high rates of
false-positive protein identification and are limited to the analysis
of tryptic digests of FFPE tissues by liquid chromatographyβ€“MS
(LCβ€“MS).
Our laboratory has been studying the reactions
of formaldehyde
with proteins and ways to reverse these reactions.21 Using proteins in aqueous solution, we demonstrated that
the majority of protein formaldehyde adducts and cross-links were
consistently reversed with mild heating following the removal of excess
formaldehyde by dialysis.22 We then developed
a tissue surrogate, which consists of one or more proteins that form
a gel-like plug when treated with formaldehyde at protein concentrations
exceeding 75 mg/mL. These tissue surrogates have sufficient physical
integrity to be processed using normal histological methods.23 A variety of extraction buffers and heating
protocols were examined for their ability to recover proteins from
tissue surrogates. Protein recovery was generally modest, and studies
with multiprotein tissue surrogates revealed extraction bias, meaning
that the composition of the solubilized proteins did not match that
of the corresponding tissue surrogate. Subsequent studies showed that
the ethanol dehydration step of histology caused most formaldehyde-treated
proteins to adopt conformations enriched in Ξ²-sheets, leading
to the formation of protein aggregates where the Ξ²-sheets form
a dense network of intermolecular formaldehyde cross-links.11 We proposed that the difficulty of rehydrating
these stabilized protein aggregates was the primary impediment to
recovering proteins from FFPE tissue.
Pressure promotes water
penetration into the inner core of proteins,
causing denaturation, whereas heat alone causes protein unfolding
followed by aggregation.24 Consequently,
we hypothesized that the combined effects of heat and elevated pressure
would facilitate the rehydration of the highly cross-linked protein
aggregates in FFPE tissues. The increased exposure to water should
greatly improve protein solubilization while simultaneously promoting
the reversal of proteinβ€“formaldehyde adducts and cross-links.
Initial physical studies on tissue surrogates supported this hypothesis25 and suggested that the effect of pressure was
to reduce the size of protein aggregates through increased water penetration,
rather than to increase the rate of reversal of proteinβ€“formaldehyde
adducts and cross-links directly.26
Encouraged by these results, we extracted FFPE mouse liver tissues
with heat augmented by elevated hydrostatic pressure, with the goal
of reducing extraction bias, improving the recovery of intact proteins,
and obtaining tryptic digests that more closely resemble those from
matched fresh-frozen tissue. This manuscript describes these efforts.

Materials and ethods
aterials. Tissue Tek OCT compound was purchased from
Sakura, USA, Amicon Ultra 3K centrifugal filters were purchased from
Millipore, and 37% formaldehyde and Pierce Detergent Removal columns
were obtained from Thermo Fisher. Precast NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4β€“12%
gels, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidβ€“SDS
running buffer, and the SilverQuest staining kit were purchased from
Life Technologies. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
unless stated otherwise.High-Pressure InstrumentationTissue extracts were
heated under a pressure of 40,000 psi (276 MPa) using both home-built
and commercial instruments. The home-built instrument consisted of
a 2-mL capacity MS-1 stainless steel reaction vessel coupled to a
manually operated high pressure piston screw pump available from High
Pressure Equipment Company (Erie, PA). The temperature of the pressure
vessel was regulated by a Eurotherm 2132 temperature controller (Leesburg,
VA) connected to an aluminum heating collar surrounding the reaction
vessel. The tissue extract (2 mL) was added directly to the reaction
vessel using a syringe. The construction and operation of this pressure
system has been described in detail previously.25,26 The commercial instrument was a model NEP 2320 barocycler (Pressure
Biosciences) modified by the manufacturer to hold isobaric pressure
and to provide temperature control up to 95 Β°C. The tissue extract
(2 mL) was added to a FT500 sample tube, which was capped and placed
in the pressure vessel of the Barocycler. The proteomic analyses were
independent of which pressure instrument was used.Mouse Liver HistologyThe liver from a female BALB/c
mouse was obtained under the secondary use provision from the Department
of Laboratory Animal Medicine of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
(USA). Half of the liver was immediately frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT
compound, divided into several equal-sized pieces, and stored at β�’80
Β°C. The other half was fixed for 48 h at 4 Β°C in 10% formalin.
The fixed liver tissue was washed for 30 min with distilled water
and dehydrated through a graded series of alcohols (70, 85, and 100%
by volume) and two changes of xylene, 30 min each. The tissue was
then embedded in paraffin using established histology protocols.25,27 The FFPE tissue block was stored at room temperature. For protein
recovery experiments, 10 ΞΌm sections of FFPE mouse liver were
cleared of paraffin by incubating the sections through two changes
of xylene for 10 min each. The sections were rehydrated through a
series of graded alcohols for 10 min eachβ€”2 changes each of
100% ethanol, 85% ethanol, and 70% ethanolβ€”and then incubated
in distilled water for a minimum of 30 min, as described previously.25 Matched fresh-frozen and FFPE liver tissue sections
were analyzed after 30 days, and again after 1 year, of storage.Pressure-Assisted Extraction of FFPE TissueThe ability
of elevated hydrostatic pressure combined with heat to improve the
recovery of proteins from FFPE mouse liver tissue was evaluated using
two heat-based FFPE proteomic protocols recently reported in the literature.2,3 For each protocol, the experimental procedure was followed exactly
as published, but with the heating step divided into two arms, or
variations. In the first arm, the FFPE tissue extract was heated at
the temperature and for the length of time reported in the original
method. In the second experimental arm, the temperature and length
of time was identical, but the experiment was performed under a pressure
of 40,000 psi. The two experimental arms were then analyzed using
identical gel electrophoresis and LC/MS conditions. The protein content
of the tissue extracts was determined using a BCA protein assay kit
(Pierce).Protocol-1Five 10 ΞΌm sections were cut from
the mouse liver FFPE tissue block. Following deparaffinization and
rehydration, the tissue was cut into small pieces and suspended in
3β€“6 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 2% SDS (extraction buffer 1,
EB1) as described by Shi et al.2 The tissue
suspension was homogenized with three 5-s cycles of sonication on
ice using a probe-tip sonicator, and the resulting homogenate was
split into two equal fractions. One fraction (protocol-1A) was incubated
at 100 Β°C for 30 min followed by 80 Β°C for 2 h at atmospheric
pressure (14.7 psi) in a sand bath. The second fraction (protocol-1P)
was incubated at 100 Β°C for 30 min followed by 80 Β°C for
2 h at 40,000 psi using our hand-built pressure instrument. A 750
ΞΌm section (approximate thickness) of matched fresh-frozen liver
was cut with a razor blade and homogenized in 22.5 mL of EB1 by sonication
as described above. Proteins were extracted using two methods: incubation
of the homogenate in an ice bath for 2.5 h (protocol-1FI) or incubation
at 100 Β°C for 30 min followed by 80 Β°C for 2 h at atmospheric
pressure using a sand bath (protocol-1FH). Protocol-2. Five 10 ΞΌm sections were cut from the mouse liver
FFPE tissue block. Following deparaffinization and rehydration, the
tissue was cut into small pieces and suspended in 3β€“6 mL of
100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mM DTT, 4% SDS (extraction buffer 2, EB2)
as described by Ostasiewicz et al.3 and
homogenized with three 5-s cycles of sonication on ice using a probe-tip
sonicator. One fraction (protocol-2A) was incubated at 95 Β°C
for 1 h at atmospheric pressure in a sand bath. The second fraction
(protocol-2P) was incubated at 95 Β°C for 1 h at 40,000 psi using
the Barocycler instrument. A 750 ΞΌm section of matched fresh-frozen
liver was cut with a razor blade and homogenized in 22.5 mL of EB2
by sonication as described above. Proteins were extracted by incubating
the homogenate at 95 Β°C for 3 min at atmospheric pressure using
a sand bath (protocol-2FH).Preparation of Samples for MSAll FFPE and matched
fresh-frozen mouse liver tissue extracts (40 ΞΌg each) were separated
by SDS-PAGE on precast NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4β€“12% gels using 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidβ€“SDS running buffer.
The gels were stained using the SilverQuest silver staining kit and
documented using an Epson V500 photoscanner and annotated in Adobe
Photoshop, version 7.1. Each gel lane was then divided into 10 bands
and placed into microcentrifuge tubes. In-gel tryptic digestion was
carried out as previously described.25Mass Spectrometry and Data AnalysisSeparation of the
digested peptides was performed using nanocolumns prepared in-house
(75 ΞΌm i.d. packed with Jupiter C18 particles, 5 ΞΌm, 300
ΗΊ) connected to an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system, which
was used to deliver binary gradient solvents A (0.1% formic acid (FA)
in water) and B (0.1% FA in acetonitrile). Reversed-phase chromatography
was performed by solubilizing the lyophilized tryptic peptides in
10 ΞΌL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and injecting 7 ΞΌL
of sample per analysis. After sample injection, a 20-min wash with
98% mobile phase A was used to remove any remaining salts from the
sample. Peptide elution was accomplished using a linear gradient of
2% solvent B to 42% solvent B over 45 min at a constant flow rate
of 250 nL/min.The nanoflow reversed-phase LC column was coupled
online to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoElectron)
using the manufacturerβ€™s nanoelectrospray source with an applied
electrospray potential of 1.75 kV and a capillary transfer tube temperature
of 185 Β°C. The LTQ-MS was operated in a data-dependent mode where
each full MS scan was followed by seven tandem MS scans in which the
seven most abundant peptide molecular ions detected were dynamically
selected for MS/MS analysis using a normalized CID energy of 35%.
A dynamic exclusion of 60-s was applied to reduce redundant selection
of peptides.The MS/MS spectra were analyzed using SEQUEST (ThermoElectron)
against a combined UniProt nonredundant mouse proteome database containing
36,799 protein sequences. Only peptides with conventional tryptic
termini (allowing for up to two internal missed cleavages) possessing
delta-correlation scores (Ξ”Cn) > 0.08 and charge state-dependent cross-correlation (Xcorr) criteria as follows were considered as
legitimate identifications: >1.9 for +1 charged peptides, >2.2
for
+2 charged peptides, and >3.1 for +3 charged peptides. A reverse-database
search, performed using the respective databases, resulted in a calculated
false-positive rate of <2% for all samples analyzed.

Results and iscussion
xtraction of  ouse iver: lectrophoresis. FFPE
and matched fresh-frozen mouse liver tissue stored for 30 days were
extracted using protocol-1. The fresh liver tissue was completely
solubilized in the extraction buffer (EB1) using extraction either
on ice (protocol-1FI) or at elevated temperature (protocol-1FH). The
quantity of protein solubilized in the buffer was designated as 100%
protein recovery in Table 1. FFPE mouse liver
tissue extracted at atmospheric pressure (protocol-1A) resulted in
a protein recovery of only 17%, and a large plug of remaining tissue
was observed in the extraction vial. In contrast, when the extraction
was performed at 40,000 psi (protocol-1P), the solubilized protein
increased to 77% and only a small amount of tissue residue remained
in the vial. FFPE and matching fresh-frozen liver tissue stored for
1 year were extracted using protocol-2. The fresh liver tissue was
completely solubilized in the extraction buffer (EB2) when extracted
at elevated temperature (protocol-2FH). The quantity of protein solubilized
in the buffer was designated as 100% protein recovery in Table 1. The advantage of using elevated pressure was again
evident, as 79% of the FFPE liver protein was solubilized at elevated
hydrostatic pressure (protocol-2P) while only 18% was recovered at
ambient pressure (protocol-2A).Table 1MS Analysis for FFPE and Matched Fresh-Frozen

in extraction buffer and heated with or without elevated pressure.
Fresh-frozen tissue was extracted either at atmospheric pressure using
the indicated extraction condition or on ice for 2.5 h.bProtocol used for protein extraction
(see Materials and Methods).cTissue was heated at 100 Β°C
for 30 min; then the temperature was lowered to 80 Β°C for 2 h.dThe amount of protein extracted
from fresh frozen tissue was set to 100%.Previous studies using FFPE tissue surrogates containing
several
proteins23 indicated that failure to completely
solubilize the tissue surrogate led to extraction bias, such that
the composition of the solubilized protein solution differed significantly
from that of the original surrogate. The extraction bias became less
significant as the percentage of total protein solubilized from the
tissue surrogate increased.23 Thus, the
4-fold improvement in protein solubilization realized when the extraction
was performed at elevated pressure is likely to lead to a protein
extract that more accurately represents the composition of the original
FFPE tissue. Further, the increased amount of recovered protein allows
a greater number of analytical techniques to be performed. While most
published proteomic studies of FFPE tissue analyze only a few thousand
cells from microdissected tissue,3β�’5,28 the use of elevated pressure has the advantage of improving protein
extraction from whole tissue sections. This ability is particularly
useful in instances where tissue microdissection is not practical
or when a more global proteomic analysis is desired. Unbiased protein
extraction and standardized protocols are particularly important with
techniques such as reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs), where the
protein components of cell signaling pathways are quantified to direct
clinical treatment of cancer.29The
30-day-old FFPE mouse liver extracted at 40,000 psi (protocol-1P)
exhibited a number of well resolved high and low molecular weight
protein bands by SDS-PAGE, corresponding to β�Ό87% of those seen
in the matched fresh-frozen tissue extracted on ice (Figure 1, lanes 2 and 1, respectively). The FFPE samples
extracted at ambient pressure (protocol-1A) contained relatively few
well-resolved protein bands equivalent to β�Ό25% of those seen
in frozen mouse liver (Figure 1, lane 3). Similar
results were seen with 1-year-old FFPE mouse liver extracted at 40,000
psi (protocol-2P) with well resolved high and low molecular weight
protein bands corresponding to 74% of those seen in the matched fresh-frozen
tissue (not shown). When the extraction was performed ambient pressure
(protocol-2A) this value was reduced to 25%.Figure 11D SDS-PAGE of fresh-frozen
and FFPE mouse liver extracts: lane
1, fresh-frozen tissue (protocol-1FI); lane M, molecular weight marker;
lane 2, FFPE tissue extracted with heat at 40,000 psi (protocol-1P);
lane 3, FFPE tissue extracted with heat alone (protocol-1A).As top-down MS sequencing technology improves,
the ability to extract
and analyze intact proteins from FFPE tissue will become more important.
Top-down sequencing facilitates the measurement of combinations of
modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, and the
direct quantitation of specific protein isoforms and splice variants.
Few of these measurements are directly obtainable using bottom-up
proteomic approaches in which proteins are digested into peptides.
The ability to extract intact proteins from the seemingly inexhaustible
source of FFPE tissues will increase the diagnostic and prognostic
efficacy of proteomic-based biomarker discovery by allowing biomarker
validation using orthogonal methods such as Western blotting, immunohistochemistry,
immunoassays, and structural and interaction proteomics. In this context,
the >3-fold increase in the recovery of intact proteins from FFPE
tissue achieved by using elevated pressure represents a significant
breakthrough.Extraction of FFPE Mouse Liver: LC-MS/MS AnalysisFFPE
and matched fresh-frozen liver tissue stored for 30 days were extracted
using protocol-1. FFPE tissue was extracted at ambient pressure (protocol-1A)
or 40,000 psi (protocol-1P), while the matched fresh-frozen liver
tissue was extracted using protocol-1FI and protocol-1FH. The solubilized
proteins were separated by 1D-PAGE, and each gel lane was excised,
digested with trypsin, desalted, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The total
unique peptide and protein identifications for each tissue type and
extraction condition are shown in Table 1.
FFPE tissue extracted with heat alone resulted in the identification
of 5565 unique peptides and 3449 unique proteins. The addition of
elevated hydrostatic pressure significantly improved both the number
of unique peptides (9621) and proteins (5192) identified. The number
of proteins identified from the high pressure-extracted sample was
comparable to the number of unique proteins identified from fresh-frozen
tissue, which ranged from 4932 for tissue extracted on ice to 4451
for frozen tissue extracted with heat (Table 1).The MS results for the 30-day-old FFPE mouse liver extracted
under elevated pressure (protocol-1P) and the matched fresh-frozen
tissue extracted on ice (protocol-1FI) were searched using GOMiner,
a gene ontology program. The identified proteins were categorized
by their subcellular compartment and their biological function. The
results of the gene ontology classification are shown in Figure 2. The percentages of nuclear, membrane, intracellular,
and extracellular proteins identified in fresh-frozen and FFPE liver
were virtually identical (Figure 2A), as were
the results for classification by biological function (Figure 2B).Figure 2Gene ontology analysis of proteins identified by LC-MS/MS.
Proteins
identified using fresh-frozen mouse liver (protocol-1FI) or FFPE liver
extracted with heat and elevated pressure (protocol-1P) were categorized
by subcellular localization (A) or biological process (B), using GoMiner
gene ontology software.To address the effect of long-term storage of the
FFPE specimens,
the mouse liver samples were investigated after an additional 11 months
of storage (1-year-old sample). FFPE tissue was extracted at ambient
pressure (protocol-2A) or 40,000 psi (protocol-2P), while the matched
fresh-frozen liver tissue was extracted at high temperature (protocol-2FH).
The solubilized proteins were separated by 1D-PAGE, and each gel lane
was excised, digested with trypsin, desalted, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
From the 1-D gel, we were able to identify 3492 nonredundant proteins
in the 1-year-old FFPE liver extracted under elevated pressure, which
was comparable to the 3415 nonredundant proteins identified in the
matched fresh-frozen mouse liver extracted at high temperature. In
contrast, only 107 unique proteins were identified in the FFPE tissue
extracted at ambient pressure.Figure 3 shows Venn diagrams of the unique
and common (overlapping) proteins identified in mouse liver tissue
extracts prepared by different methods. Figure 3A compares 30-day-old fresh-frozen liver tissue extracted on ice
(protocol-1FI) versus 100 Β°C for 30 min followed by 80 Β°C
for 2 h (protocol-1FH). Figure 3B compares
30-day-old FFPE liver tissue extracted under pressure (protocol-1P)
versus matched fresh-frozen liver extracted at elevated temperature
(protocol-1FH). Figure 3C compares 1-year-old
FFPE liver tissue extracted under pressure (protocol-2P) versus matched
fresh-frozen liver extracted at elevated temperature (protocol-2FH).
Notably, the common proteins, expressed as a percentage of either
the FFPE or matched fresh-frozen mouse liver tissue, were β�Ό50%
for all three tissue pairs.Figure 3Venn diagrams showing the number of unique and
common proteins
identified using LC MS/MS analysis: panel A, fresh-frozen tissue extracted
on ice (protocol-1FI) or with heat (protocol-1FH); panel B, fresh-frozen
tissue extracted with heat (protocol-1FH) and FFPE mouse liver extracted
with elevated pressure (protocol-1P); panel C, fresh-frozen tissue
extracted with heat (protocol-2FH) and FFPE mouse liver extracted
with elevated pressure (protocol-2P).Figure 4A is a pie chart
showing the number
of unique proteins identified by two or more fully tryptic peptides
for 30-day-old FFPE mouse liver extracted under pressure (protocol-1P).
The results reveal that 49% of the proteins were identified by two
peptides, 51% were identified by three or more peptides, and 21% of
the proteins were identified by five or more peptides. Figure 4B shows similar results for 1-year-old FFPE mouse
liver extracted under pressure (protocol-2P), with 57% of the proteins
identified by two peptides, 41% by three or more peptides, and 15%
identified by five or more peptides. These results are similar to
those for the matched fresh-frozen mouse liver tissue (not shown).

Conclusion
irtually all protocols reported in the
literature for the extraction
of proteins from  tissue use a variation of the heat-induced antigen
retrieval technique developed by hi and aylor30 for the recovery of antigenicity in immunohistochemical
studies. his method involves exposing  tissue sections to a buffer
solution containing a detergent and/or protein denaturant and elevated
temperatures of 90β€“120 ° for a period of 10β€“30
min.31 ptimal antigen recovery varies
with the host  tissue, with each type requiring different buffers,
p. H values, buffer additives, and incubation temperatures.32,33 Although the FFPE proteomic literature is still quite limited, it
is not unreasonable to propose that the same situation applies to
the proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues. Elevated hydrostatic pressure
is not a technique unto itself but rather an adjuvant method that
can be applied to existing or future FFPE protein extraction protocols.
While it remains to be shown that this method is useful with every
tissue fixation and protein extraction protocol, elevated pressure
acts through purely physical means26 and
should be compatible with FFPE protein extraction buffers of any pH
and containing any detergent, protein denaturant, or other additive.25 This should allow its integration into a wide
range of protein extraction protocols for MS-based proteomics with
little to no alteration to downstream sample preparation and analysis.
This was demonstrated in this report by the successful application
of elevated pressure to two very different published FFPE protein
extraction protocols. An increase in pressure to 40,000 psi, to augment
heat treatment, improved protein extraction efficiency from FFPE mouse
liver tissue by approximately 4-fold and increased the number of unique
proteins identified by up to 30-fold over the published methods used
at ambient pressure. Further, the tryptic digests of these pressure-extracted
tissues resulted in protein profiles that more closely resembled those
from matched fresh-frozen tissue when analyzed by LC/MS than did those
extracted with heat alone, while maintaining a false-identification
rate of <2%. The ability of elevated pressure to significantly
improve the recovery of intact proteins from FFPE tissues over the
use of heat alone has great potential for broad application to top-down
proteomic studies for the identification of disease biomarkers.
