This unit describes a method of isolating of proteins from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue for mass spectrometry analysis. Heat-induced antigen retrieval is the basis of the protein extraction strategy presented in this protocol. This protocol may be used to identify nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane proteins from FFPE tissues extracted from tissue blocks or slides.
