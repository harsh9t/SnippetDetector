Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue archives and their associated diagnostic records represent an invaluable source of proteomic information on diseases where the patient outcomes are already known. Over the last few years, advances in methodology have made it possible to recover peptides from FFPE tissues that yield a reasonable representation of the proteins recovered from identical fresh or frozen specimens. These new methods, based largely upon heat-induced antigen retrieval techniques borrowed from immunohistochemistry, have developed sufficiently to allow at least a qualitative analysis of the proteome of FFPE archival tissues. This chapter describes the approaches for performing proteomic analysis on FFPE tissues by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
