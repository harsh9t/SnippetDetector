The purpose of the present study was to compare endocrine parameters reflecting reproductive function and metabolism in ten amenorrheic (AR) and eumenorrheic (ER) adolescent female runners and seven untrained controls (SE). Additionally, responses to diagnostic criteria for eating disorders (DSM-III) were compared among groups. AR ran more miles/day and consumed fewer kcal/d to support energy expenditure compared to ER (p < 0.05). Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE. AR indicated they were very concerned about their weight and were fearful of gaining fat mass. Female adolescents who participate in strenuous training exhibit alterations in hormone levels reflecting reproductive function and metabolism.
