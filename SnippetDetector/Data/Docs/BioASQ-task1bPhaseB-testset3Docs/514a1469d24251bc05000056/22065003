There have been several success stories in the field of pharmacogenetics in recent years, including the analysis of HER2 amplification for trastuzumab selection in breast cancer and VKORC1 genotyping for warfarin dosing in thrombosis. Encouraging results from these studies suggest that genetic factors may indeed be important determinants of drug response and toxicity for at least some drugs. However, to apply pharmacogenetics appropriately, a thorough understanding of the scope and limitations of this field is required. The challenges include an appreciation of biological variability, logistical issues pertaining to the proper management of information, the need for robust methods and adequate sample quality with well-designed workflows. At the same time, the economics of pharmacogenetic testing from the perspective of clinicians, patients, governments, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies will play an important role in determining its future use. Ethical considerations such as informed consent and patient privacy, as well as the role of regulatory bodies in addressing these issues, must be fully understood. Only once these issues are properly dealt with can the full benefits of pharmacogenetics begin to be realised.
