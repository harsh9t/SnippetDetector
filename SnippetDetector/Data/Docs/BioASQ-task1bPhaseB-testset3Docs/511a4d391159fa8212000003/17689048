A detailed analysis of the structure and function, along with evolutionary aspects, of the main plant cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases (C5-MTases) is presented. The evolutionary relationships between the already known and four candidate plant C5-MTases identified in this work were investigated using the distance, maximum-parsimony, and maximum-likelihood approaches. The topologies of the trees were overall congruent: four monophyletic groups corresponding to the four plant C5-MTase families were clearly distinguished. In addition, sequence analyses of the plant C5-MTase target recognition domain sequences were performed and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed showing that there is good conservation among but not within the plant C5-MTase families. Furthermore, a conserved dipeptide that plays an important role in flipping the target base into the catalytic site of the C5-MTases was identified in all plant C5-MTases under study.
