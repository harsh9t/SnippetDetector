Using the 1kb 3' terminal DNA fragment of the mouse methyltransferase cDNA as a probe and low stringent hybridisation conditions, a new potential methyltransferase (MTase) gene family was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA library. One clone (MTase-11), which gave the strongest signal at the Northern blot, was entirely sequenced (11483 bp) and further characterised. Under consideration of the likely open reading frames and our preliminary cDNA experiments we propose that the clone 11 gene encodes for an approximately 90 kD protein. As deduced form the DNA sequence this protein contains all conserved sequence motifs specific for the 5m cytosine MTases. MTase-11 gene expression was demonstrable in callus and during germination but not in one month old plants or in leaves.
