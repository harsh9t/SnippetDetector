The lysosomal matrix is estimated to contain about 50 different proteins. Most of the matrix proteins are acid hydrolases that depend on mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPR) for targeting to lysosomes. Here, we describe a comprehensive proteome analysis of MPR-binding proteins from mouse. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts defective in both MPR (MPR 46-/- and MPR 300-/-) are known to secrete the lysosomal matrix proteins. Secretions of these cells were affinity purified using an affinity matrix derivatized with MPR46 and MPR300. In the protein fraction bound to the affinity matrix and eluted with mannose 6-phosphate, 34 known lysosomal matrix proteins, 4 candidate proteins of the lysosomal matrix and 4 non-lysosomal contaminants were identified by mass spectrometry after separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or by multidimensional protein identification technology. For 3 of the candidate proteins, mammalian ependymin-related protein-2 (MERP-2), retinoid-inducible serine carboxypeptidase (RISC) and the hypothetical 66.3-kDa protein we could verify that C-terminally tagged forms bound in an M6P-dependent manner to an MPR-affinity matrix and were internalized via MPR-mediated endocytosis. Hence these 3 proteins are likely to represent hitherto unrecognized lysosomal matrix proteins.
