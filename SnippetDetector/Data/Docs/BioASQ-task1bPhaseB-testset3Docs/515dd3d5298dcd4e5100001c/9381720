Angiotensin convertase inhibitor (Enalapril) was used in 51 children aged 4 days up to 18 years (mean 4.3 +/- 5.5, years). As many as 27 subjects were newborns (4) and infants (23). The patients suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congestive cardiomyopathy (13 cases). 6 treated subjects suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congenital heart malformations before cardiac surgery and 22 after it (including complex malformations operated according to Fontan method). 10 children were treated because of arterial hypertension. 4 subjects suffered form life-threatening arrhythmias coexisting with circulatory insufficiency. (These subjects were already mentioned among the patients suffering from circulatory insufficiency). Enalapril (mainly as a drug named Benalapril) was used in the mean dose of 0.21 mg/kg of body mass daily. 4 patients (8%) died during treatment but their deaths can not be related to angiotensin convertase inhibitor therapy. In the other children (82%) the beneficial influence of angiotensin convertase inhibitor use was found (improvement in comparison with the state before convertase inhibitor introduction). In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect. According to authors' opinion enalapril use is exceptionally profitable in the subjects surgically treated for complex heart malformations (Fontan operation). The beneficial effect was also found in majority of children suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy. Convertase inhibitor was always successfully used as the unique antihypertensive drug in children suffering from arterial hypertension. In the other cases treatment was combined (mainly with digitalis). This combination seems to be exceptionally useful in children suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy. Only in 1 case unserious side effect was found (persistent cough).
