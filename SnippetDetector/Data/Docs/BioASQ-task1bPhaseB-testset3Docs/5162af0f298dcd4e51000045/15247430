Deadenylation of mRNA is often the first and rate-limiting step in mRNA decay. PARN, a poly(A)-specific 3' --> 5' ribonuclease which is conserved in many eukaryotes, has been proposed to be primarily responsible for such a reaction, yet the importance of the PARN function at the whole-organism level has not been demonstrated in any species. Here, we show that mRNA deadenylation by PARN is essential for viability in higher plants (Arabidopsis thaliana). Yet, this essential requirement for the PARN function is not universal across the phylogenetic spectrum, because PARN is dispensable in Fungi (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and can be at least severely downregulated without any obvious consequences in Metazoa (Caenorhabditis elegans). Development of the Arabidopsis embryos lacking PARN (AtPARN), as well as of those expressing an enzymatically inactive protein, was markedly retarded, and ultimately culminated in an arrest at the bent-cotyledon stage. Importantly, only some, rather than all, embryo-specific transcripts were hyperadenylated in the mutant embryos, suggesting that preferential deadenylation of a specific select subset of mRNAs, rather than a general deadenylation of the whole mRNA population, by AtPARN is indispensable for embryogenesis in Arabidopsis. These findings indicate a unique, nonredundant role of AtPARN among the multiple plant deadenylases.
