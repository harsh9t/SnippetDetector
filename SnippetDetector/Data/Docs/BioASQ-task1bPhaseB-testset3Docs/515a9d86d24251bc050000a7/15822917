Today, proteomics is an exciting approach to discover potential biomarkers of different disorders. One challenge with proteomics experiments is the wide concentration range of proteins in various tissues and body fluids. The most abundant component in human body fluids, human serum albumin (HSA), is present at concentrations corresponding to approximately 50% of the total protein content in, e.g., plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If this component could be selectively removed, then the chances of observing lower-abundance component of clinical interest would be greatly improved. There are today several approaches of varying specificity available for depletion. In this study, the properties of two commercially available kits, for the removal of HSA and HSA and immunoglobulin G (IgG), respectively, were compared, and the benefits of using depletion steps prior to on-line LC-FTICR MS were evaluated. Both methods were applied on plasma and CSF. To our knowledge, these are the first results reported for CSF. Also, the combination with electrospray LC-FTICR MS is novel. The proportion of depleted HSA and IgG was estimated using global labeling markers for peptide quantification. Both depletion-methods provided a significant reduction of HSA, and the identification of lower abundant components was clearly facilitated. A higher proportion of HSA was removed using the affinity-based removal kit, and consequently more proteins could be identified using this approach.
