<abstract>
Although most hypothyroid patients do well with one single tablet of thyroxine daily, approximately 10% are dissatisfied and another important group of patients is difficult to control. We reviewed the most common causes for frequent-dose adjustment or high-dose requirement, including poor compliance with therapy and inadequate medication. Since these two causes have been ruled out, drug interaction and other concomitant diseases need to be investigated. Requirements of thyroxine increase in all conditions characterized by impaired gastric acid secretion. Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids and a long list of drugs may decrease thyroxine absorption. In addition, a series of diseases including celiac disease and chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases, as well as nutritional habits may be important in patient control. Finally, we mention the effects of a growing list of drugs and thyroid disruptors that may also affect thyroid hormone metabolism at many levels.
