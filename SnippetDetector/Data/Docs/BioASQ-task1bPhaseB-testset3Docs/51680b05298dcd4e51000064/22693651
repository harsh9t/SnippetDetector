1. ntroduction
iastolic heart failure () is most commonly seen in elderly patients and women with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac ischemia, and so on. xisting research revealed that elevated oxidative stress, () oxidase expression, protein carbonyl formation, protein oxidation, and protein modification as well as enhanced  level have been found in aged cardiac myocytes [1]. he major cause for  is cardiac aging, which is referred to as a dramatic decline in cardiac pump function with advanced age and resulted in diastolic dysfunction [2, 3]. ue to lack of understanding the mechanism of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, current clinical treatment for patients with  is disappointing [4β€“6]. herefore, understanding mechanism of aging myocardial diastolic dysfunction in molecular level is especially important for the specific therapeutic targets of  association with aging. 
-galactose is a reducing sugar that reacts readily with the free amines of amino acids in proteins and peptides both in vitro and in vivo to form advanced glycation endproducts (s) [4].  is increased during aging and has been linked to the pathogenesis of many age-associated pathologies such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, nephropathy, infection, and lzheimer's disease [5]. ur previous study demonstrated that -galactose injection led to accelerated aging phenotypes manifested by an increased s level, and aging rats fed with -galactose present significant cardiac remodeling compared with adult rats, which was manifested by increased left ventricular posterior wall and interventricular septal thickness and by increased left ventricular weight and impaired diastolic function. he contents of , mt. DNA, and AGEs were significantly increased; however, the contents of SOD and GSH-PX were decreased. Therefore, we have simulated aging process in vivo by D-galactose intervention in order to study aging-related cardiac diastolic dysfunction.
The incidence of cardiac diastolic dysfunction is related to an elevated myocardial stiffness and the resting tension (Fpassive) which led to diastolic capacity decline. The increase in myocardial stiffness is mainly related to AGEs cross-linking with collagen deposition on myocardial interstitium, whereas the latter is mainly related to abnormal myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport regulatory proteins which led the intracellular calcium overload in diastolic phase [6]. Dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis plays a significant role in the aged myocardial cell, which leads to diastolic heart failure. An excessive increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ and impaired translocating calcium ions from the cytosol to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum would result in Ca2+ overload and thus produce myocardial diastolic dysfunction [2].
As intracellular calcium is mainly regulated by the activity of myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport regulatory proteins, removal of calcium from the cytosol may be delayed by a decrease in the activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphate (SERCA) or an increase in the level of activity of phospholamban (PLN), which is a SERCA-inhibitory protein [7]. SERCA and PLN dysfunction may lead to intracellular calcium overload, which further arouse diastolic dysfunction [8]. 
EGb761 is a standard extract from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba (Yinxing) containing 24% ginkgo-flavone glycosides (e.g., kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin derivatives) and 6% terpenoid (e.g., ginkgolides A, B, C, J and bilobalide) [9]. Numerous studies have shown that the flavonoid components scavenge superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide (NO) and protect myocardia from ischemia-reperfusion injury [10β€“13], and the terpenoid constituents also showed their cardioprotective effects independent from the free radical-scavenging properties [14].
The cardioprotective effects of EGb761 have been demonstrated in various in vivo and in vitro animal models and humans. The existing literature [12, 15], including our prophase research, has highlighted that EGb761 has particular antiaging effects on cardiomyocytes by inhibiting nonenzymatic glycation and reducing the deposition of AGEs in myocardium tissues [12, 16]. However, due to cardiac aging which is referred to diastolic dysfunction, it is unclear yet whether EGb761 can regulate myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport regulatory proteins to improve the diastolic function of aging cardiomyocytes. In this study, we then aimed to investigate the possible action and its molecular mechanisms in cultured D-galactose-induced aging rat cardiomyocytes of treatment EGB761.

2. aterials and ethods
2.1. rugs and eagents. Standard EGb761 preparation that we used mainly contains 4.2β€‰mg flavonoid from Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals (Karlsruhe, Germany); D-galactose and caffeine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Inc (G5388; C1778); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from Gibco Invitrogen (31600-034; 16000044); senescence Ξ²-galactosidase (Ξ²-gal) staining kit was purchase from Cell Signaling (no. 9860); rat AGEs ELISA kit was purchased from ADL Technology Inc (E0263r). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection kit was purchased from Pierce Rockford, IL, USA. Other materials used are specified in detail in the following sections.2.2. Primary Culture of CardiomyocytesNeonatal cardiomyocytes were obtained from 20 Sprague-Dawley rats aged 1-2 days. Cardiac tissue was harvested using previously described protocols with minor modifications [17]. The ventricles from the rats were minced and dissociated in 0.06% trypsin at 37Β°C. The dissociated myocytes were placed into DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 100β€‰U/mL penicillin and streptomycin in a 50β€‰mL Corning cell culture flask for 1.5β€‰h at 37Β°C with 5% CO2, which minimized nonmyocyte cells by adhesion to the bottom of the flask. The nonattached myocytes were then removed and plated (5β€“6 Γ— 105/mL) into a six-well culture cluster at 37Β°C in room air with 5% CO2. After incubation for 48β€‰h, 80% of the attached myocytes were beating spontaneously and were used for further experiments. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996).2.3. D-Galactose Treatment ProtocolThe treatment protocol for D-galactose induction was as previously described [18]. Once the attached myocytes were beating spontaneously, the DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum was removed, and DMEM supplemented with 5β€‰g/L D-galactose was added to the cardiomyocytes in the culture cluster for a further 48β€‰h incubation period. In addition, for the cardioprotection study, EGB761 plus D-galactose was added into the culture media at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20β€‰ΞΌgΒ·mLβ�’1 throughout the treatment.2.4. SA Ξ²-Gal StainingSenescence-associated Ξ²-gal (SA-Ξ²-gal) activity was measured with the Ξ²-gal staining kit at pH 6.0 according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 10β€“15β€‰min at room temperature with 1β€‰mL of fixative solution and incubated overnight at 37Β°C with the staining solution mix. Cells were observed for development of the blue coloration with a microscope at a magnification of Γ—400.2.5. AGEs ELISA AssayThe AGEs assay was performed with AGEs ELISA kit according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The reagents of the test kit were placed at room temperature for 30β€‰min and diluted 1β€‰:β€‰20 with distilled water. Aliquots of 100β€‰ΞΌL of the standards and samples were added to blank micropores and 50β€‰ΞΌL enzyme marker solution was added. Microtiter plates were incubated at 37Β°C for 60β€‰min and then washed five times and put aside for 10β€“20β€‰s each time. The A and B substrate solutions (50β€‰ΞΌL) were added into the microtiter plates for 15β€‰min dark reactions at 37Β°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50β€‰ΞΌL stop solution, and the optical density (OD) at 450β€‰nm was determined by an ultra microplate reader (ELX 808β€‰IU, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.). An AGEs standard curve was generated and the AGEs values of the samples were calculated from the standard curve.2.6. Measurement of Cardiac SERCA ActivitySERCA activity was determined by a modified p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) method routinely used in our laboratory [19]. Briefly, cardiomyocytes were homogenized and centrifuged at 4Β°C for 15β€‰min. A 10β€‰ΞΌL aliquot of supernatant was preincubated for 10β€‰min at 37Β°C with 80β€‰ΞΌL buffer solution containing: 10β€‰ΞΌL MgCl2, 10β€‰ΞΌL EGTA, 10β€‰ΞΌL KCl, 30 or 40β€‰ΞΌL HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10β€‰ΞΌL 0.01% TritonX-100, either with or without 10β€‰ΞΌL CaCl2. The phosphatase reaction was started by the addition of 10β€‰ΞΌL 10β€‰mM p-NPP disodium salt hexahydrate and stopped after 30β€‰min by the addition of 100β€‰ΞΌL 500β€‰mM Tris (pH 8.7) and 55β€‰mM EDTA. The liberated p-nitrophenol was measured by an ultra microplate reader (ELX 808β€‰IU) at a wavelength of 405β€‰nm and a standard curve was generated. The SERCA activity was expressed as the amount of p-nitrophenol produced per gram of protein in a minute (ΞΌmol/g/min).2.7. Measurement of [Ca2+]i and SR Ca2+ LoadField myocyte on the cell culture dishes (Corning Inc) and [Ca2+]i were measured as previously described [19], using Fura-2/AM (2.0β€‰ΞΌM, Invitrogen) for 30β€‰min at 37Β°C. SR Ca2+ load was measured as the Ξ”[Ca2+]i amplitude upon rapid exposure to 10β€‰mM caffeine. The ratio of background-corrected fluorescence at 340β€‰nm excitation to 380β€‰nm excitation (F340/F380 ratio) was regarded as [Ca2+]i. The time from the maximum concentration of Ca2+ to the baseline level was regarded as the time of SR Ca2+ uptake.2.8. Western BlotCells were lysed with ice-cold Cell Lysis Reagent containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Bi Yun Tian, China, P0013) to extract cytoplasm proteins. The protein concentrations of the cytoplasm were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein concentration determination. Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated to 16% SDS/PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Technology Inc). The membrane was blocked and probed overnight at 4Β°C with primary antibodies against SERCA2a (1β€‰:β€‰1000, ARB Inc.) and Ser16/Thr17-phosphorylated phospholamban (p-PLN) (1β€‰:β€‰1000, Abcam Inc/1β€‰:β€‰100, Santa Cruz Inc) and GAPDH (1β€‰:β€‰3000, Sigma), followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1β€‰h at room temperature. Blots were developed using an ECL detection system and exposed to X-ray film. Normalized bands densities were analyzed by Gel-pro analyzer software and expressed as ratios to GAPDH.2.9. Statistical AnalysisAll data are presented as mean Β± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA for multiple comparisons. Origin 7.0 (OriginLab, USA) was used to perform all statistical analysis. In each case, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3.1. 761 revented against ncreased umbers of  ²-al-ositive ells and ormation of s. To investigate whether cardiomyocytes-treated D-galactose showed a senescent phenotype, we examined the numbers of SA Ξ²-gal-positive cells in all groups of cardiomyocytes. In D-galactose-induced cardiomyocytes, the ratio of SA Ξ²-gal-positive cardiomyocytes was significantly increased than that of control cardiomyocytes. The addition of EGB761 significantly decreased the number of cells positive for SA-Ξ²-gal in a dose-dependent manner, with an optimal concentration of 20β€‰ΞΌgΒ·mLβ�’1 (n = 20 number of rats each group and n = 6 experimental replicates; P < 0.05 versus D-galactose).Meanwhile, AGEs are considered as one of the important markers in cardiac aging. In the present study, AGEs content was significantly increased in the D-galactose-treated group. Significantly decreased AGEs level was observed in different concentrations of EGB761 treatment groups (n = 20 number of rats each group and n = 6 experimental replicates; P < 0.05 versus D-galactose) (Table 1 and Figure 1).3.2. The Effect of EGB761 on the Intracellular [Ca2+]i and SR Ca2+ LoadIntracellular Ca2+ overload is suggested to be one of the main factors involved in DHF. We then used the Ca2+ indicator Fluo2/AM to determine the effect of AGEs on the intracellular [Ca2+]i, the time that Ca2+ uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum and SR Ca2+ load. In the D-galactose group, an increased diastolic [Ca2+]i was observed, and the time from the maximum concentration of Ca2+ to the baseline level was prolonged compared with the controls (P < 0.05). After perfusion with 10β€‰mM caffeine, the amplitude of the caffeine-induced calcium transient (Ξ”[Ca2+]i) also declined in D-galactose-treated group. However, above-mentioned effects were reversed by 20β€‰ΞΌgΒ·mLβ�’1 EGB761 (n = 20 number of rats each group and n = 6 experimental replicates; P < 0.05 versus D-galactose). Representative changes in the ratio are shown in Table 2.3.3. The Effect of EGB761 on SERCA Activity in CardiomyocytesTo investigate the mechanism of EGB761 on intracellular [Ca2+]i and SR Ca2+ load., the SR Ca 2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity in the cardiomyocytes was measured (Table 3). An obvious suppression of SERCA activity was observed in the D-galactose group, and this inhibition effect was attenuated by 20β€‰ΞΌgΒ·mLβ�’1 EGB761 treatment (n = 20 number of rats each group and n = 6 experimental replicates; P < 0.05 versus D-galactose).3.4. The Effect of EGB761 on Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Transport Regulatory Proteins Expression in CardiomyocytesIn order to investigate the underlying mechanisms of EGB761 protecting against aging-associated diastolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes, protein levels of calcium transport regulatory proteins were measured by Western blot. As shown in Figure 2, an approximately 60% downregulation of SERCA2a protein expression was observed in D-galactose-treated cardiomyocytes, while it was increased in addition of EGB761 compared with the D-galactose group (P < 0.05). Since the inhibitory effect of PLN on SERCA2a was dependent on the phosphorylation level of PLN, p- Ser16-PLN and p-Thr17-PLN protein expressions were then measured. As shown in Figure 2, the level of p-Ser16-PLN protein expression was markedly decreased by 54% in the D-galactose-treated cardiomyocytes compared with the control group, while it was increased in the EGB761 group (P < 0.05 versus D-galactose). However, the level of p-Thr17-PLN protein expression showed no significant changes in any groups (n = 20 number of rats and n = 6 experimental replicates; P < 0.05 versus D-galactose).

ith the discovery of in vivo derived s and then several cell-surface -binding proteins, much research has been devoted to studying  formation and the potential biological effects of s [20]. everal earlier reports showed that free radicals were increased in -galactose-treated animals and suggested that the increased free radicals may account for the underlining mechanism responsible for the acceleration of aging [21, 22]. owever, data in earlier study from ong et al. has shown that the aging change is not -galactose specific and aminoguanidine as an  inhibitor preventing sugar-induced aging changes suggests that glycation, rather than free radicals, is the major cause of aging in this model [4]. n our current study, myocardial cells chronical incubation with -galactose has been used as an artificially induced cardiomyocytes aging model for s formation and to further investigate potential anti-aging-associated diastolic dysfunction effects of 761 and underlying molecular mechanisms.
he senescent phenotypes are associated with a typical gene expression profile [23]; a senescent morphology increases in senescence-associated ²-galactosidase ( ²-gal) activity [24]. ur data showed that the numbers of  ²-gal-positive cells were significantly increased in all of cardiomyocytes after -galactose treatment for 48β€‰h. eanwhile, intracellular s content was significantly elevated compared with control group. t is confirmed that -galactose-induced cardiomyocytes aging model was successfully established in vitro. t is in agreement with those ideas in the previous literature that is accumulation of s may associate with aging [1]. hen 761 was included, however, the numbers of  ²-gal-positive cells and intracellular s content were significantly decreased, which may indicate that 761 can attenuate the intracellular formation of s and delay the cellular senescence.
elaxation dysfunction has been indicated in the aging myocardium [25]. t the cellular level, depressed relaxation reflects impaired removal of cytosolic a2+ and reduced cardiac  a2+ loading. ata from our present study depicted that s accumulated on cardiomyocytes lead to impaired intracellular a2+ handling, which is the main cause of increased diastolic [a2+]i and a prolonged relaxation duration in aged cardiomyocytes. eanwhile, similar with the results previous reported by etrova et al. [26]. s early as 1996, it was reported that all of these a2+ removal systems are functionally inhibited in diabetes [27]. ur results also demonstrated that caffeine-induced a2+ transients, an indication of the reserve of a2+ in the , were significantly reduced. owever, given 761 could increase reuptake of a2+ stores in the , curtailment of the time of  a2+ uptake and a decrease in the diastolic [a2+]i in cardiomyocytes. hese findings have suggested that 761 may protect against aging-associated diastolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. 
 imultaneously a2+ cycling is a critical determinant of cardiomyocyte contractility and dilation. n mammalian, during relaxation, about 70% of cytosolic a2+ is partly taken back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by 2a under the regulation of  and partly extruded to the external medium through the action of plasma membrane a2+ ase (,2%) and the a+/a2+ exchanger (, 28%) [28]. hus, changed level and/or activity of 2a protein and/or its regulatory protein  may influence the homeostasis of cardiac intracellular a2+ [29]. s the  phosphorylation status is the key factor regulating the function of , the main phosphorylation status of er16 and hr17 sites of  was investigated in our study [30]. ur data revealed a significant suppression of 2a function including the activity and protein level due to s accumulation. t is consistent with the results of idasee et al. hey have shown for the first time that prolongation of cardiac relaxation rate may be attributed to diabetes-induced increase in formation of s (crosslinking as well as noncrosslinking) on 2a in diabetic cardiomyopathy rat. n addition, they also have found that the formation of s may decrease the amount of serine-16 and threonine-17 phosphorylation of  [31].
owever, in case of 761 additive, the effect of suppression was relieved. ollowed by the next experiment, in order to determine which phosphorylation residue of  was involved in 761 protecting against aging-associated diastolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes, we determined the amount of p-er16- and p-hr17- protein. ur data showed that decreased p-er16- protein level was observed in -galactose-treated cardiomyocytes; while it was increased in the 761 group compared with the -galactose group ( < 0.05). owever, the protein level of p-hr17- showed no significant changes in any of the groups compared with the control cells ( > 0.05). hus, these results may imply that the activity and phosphorylation status of  and  are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac diastolic dysfunction. t was possible that 761 could upregulate 2a function through improvement of the amount of er16 sites  phosphorylation, further improving the homeostasis impairment of intracellular a2+.
ince standard b761 preparation that we used mainly contains 4.2β€‰mg flavonoid and other unknown complex composition, our results are consistent with the reports demonstrating that flavonoid components exhibit better effects than ginkgolides and bilobalides on protection of 2a function through increasing the amount of er16 sites  phosphorylation, which decline the intracellular calcium overload [32]. bdel-ader et al. also have confirmed that quercetin showed a similar antioxidant effect as b761, suggesting that ginkgo-flavone glycosides may be the major components of b761 and other unknown complex compositions effect on the endoplasmic reticulum, and other phenotypes tested in our paper may be multifactorial, including its antioxidant, antiglycemic and other properties [32, 33]. n our present study, we treat b761 plus -galactose incubation cardiomyocytes that can effectively and extensively counteract this action of aging-associated diastolic dysfunction. t may be indicated that 761 extract may be a hypothetical preventive therapy in ageing and - related disease and may potentially protect the heart from s formation [11].
aken together, due to cardiac diastolic dysfunction which is related to an elevated myocardial stiffness and the resting tension (passive), it is possible that 761 at least partially attenuates the nonenzymatic glycation formation s (crosslinking as well as noncrosslinking) on 2a in cardiomyocytes on one hand, so that it mitigates myocardial stiffness. n other hand, it improves 2a function through increasing the amount of er16 sites  phosphorylation, which declines the intracellular calcium overload in diastolic phase. he two hands effects of 761 may possibly protect against aging-associated diastolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. n this case, the 761 extract or some of its compounds may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the prevention of the cardiac alterations in diastolic dysfunction for the patients in clinical practice.4. Discussion
With the discovery of in vivo derived AGEs and then several cell-surface AGE-binding proteins, much research has been devoted to studying AGE formation and the potential biological effects of AGEs [20]. Several earlier reports showed that free radicals were increased in D-galactose-treated animals and suggested that the increased free radicals may account for the underlining mechanism responsible for the acceleration of aging [21, 22]. However, data in earlier study from Song et al. has shown that the aging change is not D-galactose specific and aminoguanidine as an AGE inhibitor preventing sugar-induced aging changes suggests that glycation, rather than free radicals, is the major cause of aging in this model [4]. In our current study, myocardial cells chronical incubation with D-galactose has been used as an artificially induced cardiomyocytes aging model for AGEs formation and to further investigate potential anti-aging-associated diastolic dysfunction effects of EGB761 and underlying molecular mechanisms.
The senescent phenotypes are associated with a typical gene expression profile [23]; a senescent morphology increases in senescence-associated Ξ²-galactosidase (SA Ξ²-gal) activity [24]. Our data showed that the numbers of SA Ξ²-gal-positive cells were significantly increased in all of cardiomyocytes after D-galactose treatment for 48β€‰h. Meanwhile, intracellular AGEs content was significantly elevated compared with control group. It is confirmed that D-galactose-induced cardiomyocytes aging model was successfully established in vitro. It is in agreement with those ideas in the previous literature that is accumulation of AGEs may associate with aging [1]. When EGB761 was included, however, the numbers of SA Ξ²-gal-positive cells and intracellular AGEs content were significantly decreased, which may indicate that EGB761 can attenuate the intracellular formation of AGEs and delay the cellular senescence.
Relaxation dysfunction has been indicated in the aging myocardium [25]. At the cellular level, depressed relaxation reflects impaired removal of cytosolic Ca2+ and reduced cardiac SR Ca2+ loading. Data from our present study depicted that AGEs accumulated on cardiomyocytes lead to impaired intracellular Ca2+ handling, which is the main cause of increased diastolic [Ca2+]i and a prolonged relaxation duration in aged cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, similar with the results previous reported by Petrova et al. [26]. As early as 1996, it was reported that all of these Ca2+ removal systems are functionally inhibited in diabetes [27]. Our results also demonstrated that caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients, an indication of the reserve of Ca2+ in the SR, were significantly reduced. However, given EGB761 could increase reuptake of Ca2+ stores in the SR, curtailment of the time of SR Ca2+ uptake and a decrease in the diastolic [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes. These findings have suggested that EGB761 may protect against aging-associated diastolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. 
 Simultaneously Ca2+ cycling is a critical determinant of cardiomyocyte contractility and dilation. In mammalian, during relaxation, about 70% of cytosolic Ca2+ is partly taken back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by SERCA2a under the regulation of PLN and partly extruded to the external medium through the action of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA,2%) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX, 28%) [28]. Thus, changed level and/or activity of SERCA2a protein and/or its regulatory protein PLN may influence the homeostasis of cardiac intracellular Ca2+ [29]. As the PLN phosphorylation status is the key factor regulating the function of SERCA, the main phosphorylation status of Ser16 and Thr17 sites of PLN was investigated in our study [30]. Our data revealed a significant suppression of SERCA2a function including the activity and protein level due to AGEs accumulation. It is consistent with the results of Bidasee et al. They have shown for the first time that prolongation of cardiac relaxation rate may be attributed to diabetes-induced increase in formation of AGEs (crosslinking as well as noncrosslinking) on SERCA2a in diabetic cardiomyopathy rat. In addition, they also have found that the formation of AGEs may decrease the amount of serine-16 and threonine-17 phosphorylation of PLN [31].
However, in case of EGB761 additive, the effect of suppression was relieved. Followed by the next experiment, in order to determine which phosphorylation residue of PLN was involved in EGB761 protecting against aging-associated diastolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes, we determined the amount of p-Ser16-PLN and p-Thr17-PLN protein. Our data showed that decreased p-Ser16-PLN protein level was observed in D-galactose-treated cardiomyocytes; while it was increased in the EGB761 group compared with the D-galactose group (P < 0.05). However, the protein level of p-Thr17-PLN showed no significant changes in any of the groups compared with the control cells (P > 0.05). Thus, these results may imply that the activity and phosphorylation status of SERCA and PLN are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac diastolic dysfunction. It was possible that EGB761 could upregulate SERCA2a function through improvement of the amount of Ser16 sites PLN phosphorylation, further improving the homeostasis impairment of intracellular Ca2+.
Since standard EGb761 preparation that we used mainly contains 4.2β€‰mg flavonoid and other unknown complex composition, our results are consistent with the reports demonstrating that flavonoid components exhibit better effects than ginkgolides and bilobalides on protection of SERCA2a function through increasing the amount of Ser16 sites PLN phosphorylation, which decline the intracellular calcium overload [32]. Abdel-Kader et al. also have confirmed that quercetin showed a similar antioxidant effect as EGb761, suggesting that ginkgo-flavone glycosides may be the major components of EGb761 and other unknown complex compositions effect on the endoplasmic reticulum, and other phenotypes tested in our paper may be multifactorial, including its antioxidant, antiglycemic and other properties [32, 33]. In our present study, we treat EGb761 plus D-galactose incubation cardiomyocytes that can effectively and extensively counteract this action of aging-associated diastolic dysfunction. It may be indicated that EGB761 extract may be a hypothetical preventive therapy in ageing and AGE- related disease and may potentially protect the heart from AGEs formation [11].
Taken together, due to cardiac diastolic dysfunction which is related to an elevated myocardial stiffness and the resting tension (Fpassive), it is possible that EGB761 at least partially attenuates the nonenzymatic glycation formation AGEs (crosslinking as well as noncrosslinking) on SERCA2a in cardiomyocytes on one hand, so that it mitigates myocardial stiffness. On other hand, it improves SERCA2a function through increasing the amount of Ser16 sites PLN phosphorylation, which declines the intracellular calcium overload in diastolic phase. The two hands effects of EGB761 may possibly protect against aging-associated diastolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. In this case, the EGB761 extract or some of its compounds may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the prevention of the cardiac alterations in diastolic dysfunction for the patients in clinical practice.
