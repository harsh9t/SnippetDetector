UNLABELLED: Dosage recommendations for the initial therapy of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in newborns vary between 8 microg/kg/d and 10-15 microg/kg/d. AIM: To evaluate the practicability of LT4 in liquid form and to define the initial dosage for optimal treatment. METHODS: Liquid LT4 solution was administered to 28 consecutive newborns with primary CH. We measured TSH, T3, T4, free T3 and free T4 before therapy and during follow-up up to 2 years. After 2 years a standardized developmental test (Griffith) was performed. RESULTS: The median dosage at start of therapy was 12.3 microg LT4/kg/d and decreased to about 5 microg LT4/kg/d after 9 months. The median time of normalization of TSH (< or =6 mU/l) was 2 weeks. In 21 patients, who received a median starting dosage of 12.7 microg LT4/kg (range 9.8-17.1 microg/kg), TSH levels normalized within a median of 1 week. Seven patients receiving only 10.1 microg LT4/kg normalized their TSH only after a median of 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Newborns with CH should normalize their TSH within 1-2 weeks. The initial dose necessary to normalize TSH is not lower when a liquid solution is used. The higher dose used in tablets is not due to inefficient absorption, but rather reflects the increased demand for thyroid hormone in the first weeks of life.
