To analyse the influence of thyroid status on the effect of aluminium (Al) upon intestinal calcium (Ca) absorption, adult male Wistar rats with experimentally altered thyroid hormones circulating levels, were orally treated (o.g.) with 0 (control), or 50 mg elemental Al (as chloride)/kg body weight (b.w.) per day, for a 14 d period. Hyper- and hypo-thyroid conditions were respectively achieved by means of administration of either sodium levothyroxine (50 microg/kg b.w. per day, o.g.) or methimazole, a thyroxine synthesis inhibitor (1mg/kg b.w. per day, o.g.). In duodenum-jejunum segments, in vitro mucosa-to-serosa (45)Ca flux (JCa(ms)) and kinetics of (45)Ca uptake in isolated enterocytes, were determined. In serum, concentrations of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. Unlike non-Al-treated rats, JCa(ms) of Al-exposed rats decreased as serum levels of T4 and T3 increased, showing a significant inverse correlation in both cases (T4: r(2)=0.414, P=0.024; T3: r(2)=0.443, P=0.018). Enterocytes isolated from rats treated with Al plus thyroxine showed a reduction of both maximum Ca uptake (4.86+/-0.44 vs. 6.85+/-1.04 nmol Ca/mg protein, P<0.05) and K(m) (0.84+/-0.18 vs. 1.05+/-0.36 mM, P<0.05) when compared to control. The observed variability in the Al effect on Ca transport with thyroid status of rats could be reflecting a negative interaction of Al with thyroid hormone action mechanisms on intestinal Ca absorption, which would take place mainly at Ca entry into enterocyte from lumen.
