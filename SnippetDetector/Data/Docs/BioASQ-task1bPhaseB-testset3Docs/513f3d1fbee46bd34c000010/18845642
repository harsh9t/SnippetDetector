Organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) 1c1 is a high-affinity T(4) transporter with narrow substrate specificity expressed at the blood-brain barrier. A transport model using cells overexpressing Oatp1c1 was created to identify novel Oatp1c1 substrates and inhibitors. Rat Oatp1c1 was cloned and stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Oatp1c1-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells transported (125)I-labeled T(4) in a time-dependent manner that was completely abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled T(4). Next, various compounds, including inhibitors of thyroid hormone uptake, were screened for inhibitory effects on Oatp1c1-mediated T(4) uptake. Phenytoin (64%), indocyanine green (17%), fenamic acid (68%), diclofenac (51%), and meclofenamic acid (33%) all reduced T(4) uptake by Oatp1c1 when assayed at concentrations of 10 microM. Dose-response assays for the fenamic acids, iopanoic acid, indocyanine green, and phenytoin revealed IC(50) values for Oatp1c1 T(4) uptake below or near the blood plasma levels after therapeutic doses. Further kinetic assays and reciprocal plot analyses demonstrated that the fenamic acid diclofenac inhibited in a competitive manner. Finally, microvessels were isolated from adult rat brain and assessed for T(4) uptake. Ten micromolar of fenamate concentrations inhibited T(4) microvessel uptake with a similar hierarchical inhibition profile [fenamic acid (43%), diclofenac (78%), and meclofenamic acid (85%)], as observed for Oatp1c1 transfected cells. Oatp1c1 is expressed luminally and abluminally in the blood-brain barrier endothelial cell, and exhibits bidirectional transport capabilities. Together, these data suggest that Oatp1c1 transports fenamates into, and perhaps across, brain barrier cells.
