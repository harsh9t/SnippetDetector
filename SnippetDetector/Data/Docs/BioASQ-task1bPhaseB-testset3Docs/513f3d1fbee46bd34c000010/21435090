BACKGROUND:  Helicobacter pylori infection is a most frequent cause of chronic gastritis. H. pylori may decrease absorption of oral thyroxine by decreasing gastric acid secretion in the stomach. In this study, we aimed to investigate the change in thyroid function tests of the cases after H. pylori eradication who were not responding to high doses of thyroxine treatment before H. pylori eradication. METHODS:  Hypothyroid cases who were not responding to high doses of thyroxine among the ones presented to Endocrinology and Gastroenterohepatology Clinics of Sisli Etfal Training and Research Hospital between 2009 and 2010 were included in the study. Thyroid function tests were performed two times in all cases before and after H. pylori eradication. Duodenal, antral and corporal biopsies, and jejunal aspirates and biopsies were taken during upper gastrointestinal system endoscopies performed in all patients. Cases without intestinal pathology were included in the study. RESULTS: Serum thyrotropin (TSH), free T3, and free T4 values before H. pylori eradication were 30.5 ± 28.8 IU/mL, 2.64 ± 0.56 pg/mL, and 0.92 ± 0.32 ng/mL, respectively, and after eradication were found to be 4.2 ± 10.6 IU/mL, 3.02 ± 0.61 pg/mL, and 1.3 ± 0.34 ng/mL, respectively (p values <.001, .002, and <.001, respectively). After H. pylori eradication treatment, TSH decreased in all of the cases, factitious thyrotoxicosis developed in % 21 of these cases. CONCLUSION: In hypothyroid cases, H. pylori gastritis may be responsible for an inadequate response to the treatment. H. pylori eradication in the cases receiving high doses of thyroxine has a risk for thyrotoxicosis.
