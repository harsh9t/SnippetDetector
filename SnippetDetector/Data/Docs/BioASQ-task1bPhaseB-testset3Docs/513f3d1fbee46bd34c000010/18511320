Absorbed thyroid dose and effective half-life were determined in 46 hyperthyroid cats after treatment with a low dose (mean 111MBq) of radioiodine intravenously. Thirteen of these cats had received iohexol for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement within 24h before treatment with radioiodine in view of another ongoing study at our institution. Pre-therapy values were obtained for total thyroxine (TT(4)) and for the thyroid to salivary gland ratio with sodium pertechnetate gamma-camera imaging. All cats underwent post-therapy scans at 24, 48 and 120 h for evaluation of radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) and the effective half-life of radioiodine. The absorbed dose was calculated from the cumulative activity with Olinda software. Both groups were comparable in age, TT(4) and the ratio of thyroid activity to salivary gland activity. Statistical analysis revealed a significant decreased absorbed dose in the thyroid in the iohexol group. This decreased uptake was not accompanied by an decreased effective half-life of the radioiodine. The variation of inter-individual RAIU decreased in this group and more homogenous absorbed doses were obtained. No significant difference in outcome could be demonstrated. However, a tendency towards a higher number of residual hyperthyroidism in the iohexol group was noted (15 versus 6% in control group). This study demonstrates that iohexol interferes with the uptake of radioiodine in the hyperthyroid cat but does not provoke increased turnover. In this study, albeit including a small number of cats, outcome did not seem to be significantly affected.
