The tissue kallikrein gene family consists of 15 genes tandemly arranged on human chromosome 19q13.4. Most kallikrein genes are characterized by aberrant expression patterns in various human cancers, a feature that makes them ideal cancer biomarkers. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the epigenetic drug compound 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on the expression of downregulated kallikrein genes in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer cell lines. Reactivation of multiple kallikrein genes was observed, although some of these genes do not contain CpG islands in their genomic sequence. Epigenetic regulation provides a new mechanism for the pharmacological modulation of kallikreins in human cancers with putative therapeutic implications.
