Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases with diverse physiological functions. Recently, growing evidence indicates that many kallikrein genes are involved in malignancy. In rodents, kallikreins are encoded by a large multigene family, but in humans only three kallikreins were thought to exist. Based on the homology between the human and rodent kallikrein loci, we studied a 300 kb region of genomic sequences around the putative KLK1 gene locus on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. By using linear sequence information, restriction analysis, end sequencing, PCR and blotting techniques, as well as bioinformatic approaches, we were able to construct the first detailed map of the human kallikrein gene family. Comparative analysis of genes located in this area, provides strong evidence that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is considerably larger than previously thought, containing at least fifteen genes. We have established, for the first time, the common structural features that apply to all members of the expanded kallikrein multigene family. Our map specifies the distance between genes to one base pair accuracy, the relative location, and the direction of transcription of all 15 genes. Determination of the true size of the kallikrein family in humans is important for our understanding of the contribution of the kallikreins to human biology and pathophysiology.
