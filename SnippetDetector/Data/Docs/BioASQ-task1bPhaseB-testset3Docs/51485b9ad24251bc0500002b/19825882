BACKGROUND: The majority of breast cancer patients are postmenopausal women who are increasingly being offered adjuvant chemotherapy. Since the beneficial effect of chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients predominantly occurs in the first 5 years after diagnosis, a prognostic marker for early events can be of use for adjuvant treatment decision making. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the 70-gene prognosis signature for early events in postmenopausal patients. METHODS: Frozen tumor samples from 148 patients aged 55-70 years were selected (T1-2, N0) and classified by the 70-gene prognosis signature (MammaPrint) into good or poor prognosis. Eighteen percent received hormonal therapy. RESULTS: Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) at 5 years was 99% for the good-prognosis signature versus 80% for the poor-prognosis signature group (P = 0.036). The 70-gene prognosis signature was a significant and independent predictor of BCCS during the first 5 years of follow-up with an adjusted hazard ratio of 14.4 (95% confidence interval 1.7-122.2; P = 0.01) at 5 years. CONCLUSION: The 70-gene prognosis signature can accurately select postmenopausal patients at low risk of breast cancer-related death within 5 years of diagnosis and can be of clinical use in selecting postmenopausal women for adjuvant chemotherapy.
