Introduction
train phe3 (= 18606 =  23796) is the type strain of rthrobacter phenanthrenivorans [1]. t was isolated from erivleptos, a creosote polluted site in pirus, reece (12 m orth of the city of oannina), where a wood preserving industry was operating for over 30 years [2]. train phe3 is of particular interest because it is able to metabolize phenanthrene at concentrations of up to 400 mg/ as a sole source of carbon and energy, at rates faster than those reported for other rthrobacter species [3-5]. t appears to internalize phenanthrene with two mechanisms: a passive diffusion when cells are grown on glucose, and an inducible active transport system, when cells are grown on phenanthrene as a sole carbon source [2]. ere we present a summary classification and a set of features for . phenanthrenivorans strain phe3, together with the description of the complete genome sequencing and annotation.Introduction
Strain Sphe3T (=DSM 18606T = LMG 23796T) is the type strain of Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans [1]. It was isolated from Perivleptos, a creosote polluted site in Epirus, Greece (12 Km North of the city of Ioannina), where a wood preserving industry was operating for over 30 years [2]. Strain Sphe3T is of particular interest because it is able to metabolize phenanthrene at concentrations of up to 400 mg/L as a sole source of carbon and energy, at rates faster than those reported for other Arthrobacter species [3-5]. It appears to internalize phenanthrene with two mechanisms: a passive diffusion when cells are grown on glucose, and an inducible active transport system, when cells are grown on phenanthrene as a sole carbon source [2]. Here we present a summary classification and a set of features for A. phenanthrenivorans strain Sphe3T, together with the description of the complete genome sequencing and annotation.

These evidence codes are from of the Gene Ontology project. If the evidence code is IDA, then the property was directly observed by one of the authors or an expert mentioned in the acknowledgements.Amylase, catalase and nitrate reductase tests were positive, whereas arginine dihydrolase, gelatinase, lipase, lysine and ornithine decarboxylase, oxidase, urease, citrate assimilation and H2S production tests were negative. No acid was produced in the presence of glucose, lactose and sucrose.
ChemotaxonomyMenaquinones are the sole respiratory lipoquinones of A. phenanthrenivorans strain Sphe3T. Both MK-8 and MK-9(H2) are present in a ratio of 3.6:1, respectively. Major fatty acids are anteiso-C15:0 (36.2%), iso-C16:0 (15.7%), iso-C15:0 (14.3%), anteiso-C17:0 (12.0%), C16:0 (8.3%), iso-C17:0 (4.0%), C16:1Ο‰7c (2.5%) and C14:0 (1.4%). The major phospholipids were diphospatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), (63.8, 27.5 and 4.0% respectively).

Genome sequencing and annotation
enome project history. This organism was selected for sequencing on the basis of its biodegradation capabilities, i.e. metabolizes phenanthrene as a sole source of carbon and energy. The genome project is deposited in the Genome OnLine Database [18] and the complete genome sequence is deposited in GenBank. Sequencing, finishing and annotation were performed by the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI). A summary of the project information is shown in Table 2.Table 2Genome sequencing project informationMIGS IDΒ Β Β Β PropertyΒ Β Β Β TermMIGS-31Β Β Β Β Finishing qualityΒ Β Β Β FinishedMIGS-28Β Β Β Β Libraries usedΒ Β Β Β Three genomic libraries:Β Β Β Β 6kb (pMCL200) and fosmids (pcc1Fos) Sanger librariesΒ Β Β Β  and one 454 pyrosequence standard libraryMIGS-29Β Β Β Β Sequencing platformsΒ Β Β Β ABI 3730. 454 GS FLXMIGS-31.2Β Β Β Β Sequencing coverageΒ Β Β Β 9.33Γ— Sanger, 17.45Γ— pyrosequenceMIGS-30Β Β Β Β AssemblersΒ Β Β Β Newbler version 1.1.02.15, ArachneMIGS-32Β Β Β Β Gene calling methodΒ Β Β Β Prodigal, GenePRIMPΒ Β Β Β INSDC IDΒ Β Β Β CP002379Β Β Β Β Genbank Date of ReleaseΒ Β Β Β February 16, 2011Β Β Β Β GOLD IDΒ Β Β Β Gc01621Β Β Β Β NCBI project IDΒ Β Β Β 38025Β Β Β Β Database: IMG-GEBAΒ Β Β Β 2503538005MIGS-13Β Β Β Β Source material identifierΒ Β Β Β DSM 12885Β Β Β Β Project relevanceΒ Β Β Β Tree of Life, GEBAGrowth conditions and DNA isolationA. phenanthrenivorans Sphe3T, DSM 18606T was grown aerobically at 30Β°C on MM M9 containing 0.02% (w/v) phenanthrene. DNA was isolated according to the standard JGI (CA, USA) protocol for Bacterial genomic DNA isolation using CTAB.Genome sequencing and assemblyThe genome of Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans type strain (Sphe3)was sequenced using a combination of Sanger and 454 sequencing platforms. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing can be found at the JGI website [19]. Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using the Newbler assembler version 1.1.02.15 (Roche). Large Newbler contigs were broken into 4,967 overlapping fragments of 1,000 bp and entered into assembly as pseudo-reads. The sequences were assigned quality scores based on Newbler consensus q-scores with modifications to account for overlap redundancy and to adjust inflated q-scores. A hybrid 454/Sanger assembly was made using the Arachne assembler [20]. Possible mis-assemblies were corrected and gaps between contigs were closed by by editing in Consed, by custom primer walks from sub-clones or PCR products. A total of 822 Sanger finishing reads were produced to close gaps, to resolve repetitive regions, and to raise the quality of the finished sequence. The error rate of the completed genome sequence is less than 1 in 100,000. Together, the combination of the Sanger and 454 sequencing platforms provided 26.78 x coverage of the genome. The final assembly contains 44,113 Sanger reads and 599,557 pyrosequencing reads.Genome annotationGenes were identified using Prodigal [21] as part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory genome annotation pipeline, followed by a round of manual curation using the JGI GenePRIMP pipeline [22]. The predicted CDSs were translated and used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant database, UniProt, TIGR-Fam, Pfam, PRIAM, KEGG, COG, and InterPro databases. Additional gene prediction analysis and functional annotation were performed within the Integrated Microbial Genomes - Expert Review (IMG-ER) platform [23].
