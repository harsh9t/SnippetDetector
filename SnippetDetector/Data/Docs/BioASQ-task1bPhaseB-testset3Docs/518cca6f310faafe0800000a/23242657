MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small RNAs representing one of the most exciting areas of modern medical science. miRNAs modulate a large and complex regulatory network of gene expression of the majority of the protein-coding genes. Currently, evidences suggest that miRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Some miRNAs as miR-1, miR-133 and miR-208a are highly expressed in the heart and strongly associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recent data indicate that these miRNAs as well as miR-206 change their expression quickly in response to physical activity. The differential regulation of miRNAs in response to exercise suggests a potential value of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) as biomarkers of physiological mediators of the cardiovascular adaptation induced by exercise. Likewise, serum levels of c-miRNAs such as miR-423-5p have been evaluated as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. On the other hand, the manipulation of miRNAs levels using techniques such as 'miR mimics' and 'antagomiRs' is becoming evident the enormous potential of miRNAs as promising therapeutic strategies in heart failure.
