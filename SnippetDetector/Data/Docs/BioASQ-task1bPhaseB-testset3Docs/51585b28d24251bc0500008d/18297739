Methylation of specific CG residues in the mammalian genome results in tissue-specific patterns of gene expression, which are critical for cell differentiation. Embryos that fail to establish and maintain proper DNA methylation patterns show severe developmental abnormalities as is the case of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) -deficient embryos. Dnmt1 is the main maintenance methyltransferase in the mouse and its expression is regulated by a splicing mechanism that dictates the expression of stage-specific isoforms. Little is known about Dnmt1 expression in the cow and isoforms of Dnmt1 are yet unknown in this species. Here we demonstrate that the previously described bovine Dnmt1 transcript is ubiquitously expressed in embryos and fetal tissue. In addition, we report the identification of a splice variant of the bovine Dnmt1, which shows a ubiquitous expression pattern. This new transcript was detected using 5'RACE and genomic mapping and its expression pattern was shown to be consistent with a tissue-specific mode of regulation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the expression of an oocyte-specific isoform of Dnmt1 is unlikely to occur in cattle. The newly reported isoform of Dnmt1 was demonstrated to be, similarly to Dnmt1a, polyadenylated and if translated possess the functional domains necessary for maintenance and de novo methyltransferase activity.
