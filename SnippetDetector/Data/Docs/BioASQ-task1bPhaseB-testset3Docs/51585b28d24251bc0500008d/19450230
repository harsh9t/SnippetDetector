DNA methylation regulates gene expression through a complex network of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in chromatin. The maintenance methylase, DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), is a prominent enzyme in the process that is linked to DNA replication and drives the heritable nature of epigenetic modifications. The mechanistic details that explain how DNMT1 catalytic action is directed and regulated in chromatin are important in our overall understanding of gene control. In this work, we show that DNMT1 is modified by SUMOylation and we have mapped these SUMOylation sites by defined mutations. SUMOylated DNMT1 is catalytically active on genomic DNA in vivo and we find that SUMOylation significantly enhances the methylase activity of DNMT1 both in vitro and in chromatin. These data suggest that SUMOylation modulates the endogenous activity of a prominent epigenetic maintenance pathway in somatic cells.
