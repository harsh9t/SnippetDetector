<abstract>
DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) has a higher specific activity on hemimethylated DNA than on unmethylated DNA, but this preference is too small to explain the faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. New genetic studies in plants and mammals have identified a novel factor that increases the fidelity of maintenance methylation.
