DNA methylation in post-mitotic neurons is reported to serve a variety of functions from survival during development to the consolidation of memory. Of particular interest with regards neuronal functioning is the change in site-specific methylation of a variety of gene promoters in the context of neuronal depolarization and the coding of new information. We examined the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a, representative of a maintenance and de novo methyltransferase respectively, in response to in-vitro depolarization of cortical neurons, using standard techniques such as high potassium (KCl) or the sodium channel agonist veratridine. KCl and veratridine mediated depolarization caused a modest but significant and replicable reduction in the mRNA and protein expression of both DNMTs that was time and dose dependent. These effects were supported by parallel increases in the mRNA expression of BDNF exon-1 and exon-4 as a typical response of neurons to depolarization and to rule out the possibility of impaired transcriptional activity as a trivial explanation. In addition to effects on mRNA and protein expression, functional DNA methyltransferase activity was reduced in nuclear protein extracts from cells exposed to a depolarization condition. Also, these changes could not be explained by differential neuronal loss as measured by cell viability cytochemistry. Our results support the idea that a reduction in DNA methyltransferase activity in the activated and depolarized neuron could contribute to the enhanced intensity and multiplicity of gene expression frequently reported.
