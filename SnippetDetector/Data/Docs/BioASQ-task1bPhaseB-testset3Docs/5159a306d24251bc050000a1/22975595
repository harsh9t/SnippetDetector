Thyroid hormones play a major role in the development and function of several organs, especially the brain. The actions of thyroid hormones are exerted through the interaction of T3 with nuclear receptors and regulation of gene expression. The present study analyzed the effects of hypothyroidism and T3 administration on gene expression in the rat brain and cerebellum during the postnatal period. To obtain hypothyroid pups, antithyroid drugs were administered to pregnant rats from gestational day 9, and after delivery. T3 was administered to the pups, at single daily doses of 5ng/g body weight from postnatal day 11 to 15. The pups were sacrificed 24hours after the last injection. Hypothyroid neonates showed increased cholesterol levels and decreased expression of D1 in liver and of Serca-2 in heart, which were normalized with T3 treatment. In the brain, there was decreased expression of Ngrn and Rasd2 in the striatum and of the genes encoding sinatotagmin12 (Syt12), hairless (Hr), neurotrofina3 (Nt3) and RevErbAα(Nrd1d) in the cerebellum, which were also normalized by T3 treatment. These results demonstrate that during the postnatal period, T3 reaches the brain and directly influences gene expression in this organ. In parallel, we studied the possible actions of a T3 analog, Kb430, which in vitro binds preferentially to thyroid receptor α (TRα). This compound had no effect on any of the parameters studied. To investigate whether the lack of activity of this compound was due to rapid metabolism, we compared its activity with that of T3 in T3 receptor transactivation assays using the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in Cos7 cells transiently expressed through TRα or TRα transfection. The results indicate that Kb430 lacks biological activity.
