The effects of thyroxine-stimulated hypertrophy (TSH) were studied in the porcine left ventricular myocardium. Hypertrophy was produced in six adult pigs by administration of triiodothyronine (1 mg/kg; i.v.) for eight days. Six pigs served as controls. The degree of hypertrophy, determined by left ventricular-to-body weight ratio, was 47%. With hypertrophy there was a significant increase in heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial blood flows. Minimal coronary resistance measured during adenosine infusion was lower in the TSH group compared with the control group. Anatomic studies revealed a balanced proliferative response of mitochondria, myofibrils and the t-tubular system during TSH. Analysis of the microvasculature indicated that the capillary and arteriolar beds both experienced growth which paralleled myocyte growth during TSH. These results suggest that thyroxine administration promotes angiogenesis in the microvascular bed which provides a partial anatomic rationale for the lowered minimal coronary resistance.
