Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death, and the most common cancer in the United States with 148,810 new cases and 49,960 deaths during 2008 alone [1]. Irinotecan (IRI) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of CRC [2], [3]. At least 15% of individuals with new CRC are candidates for IRI therapy [1], [4].
IRI efficacy is dependent on activation by carboxyesterases to form the active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), which is a potent poison of topoisomerase I that interrupts DNA replication in cancer cells, resulting in cell death [5], [6], [7]. The major route of SN-38 elimination is via glucuronidation by the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, an essential enzyme involved in the complex metabolism of IRI [5]. UGT1A1*28 is a common allele with seven TA repeats in the promoter of UGT1A1 compared with the wild-type allele (UGT1A1*1) with six repeats [6], [7], [8]. A seven-repeat allele is associated with decreased gene transcription and expression of UGT1A1 and reduced enzyme activity, which lead to higher or more prolonged exposure of SN-38, the active form of IRI [8], [9].
Given that the UGT1A1 *28 variant influences IRI metabolism through enhanced exposure of its active metabolite SN-38, it is pharmacologically plausible that the UGT1A1*28 allele may be associated with the therapeutic efficacy of IRI in addition to the risk of adverse effects [10], [11]. Researchers have investigated the efficacy of IRI in CRC patients bearing different UGT1A1*28 genotypes [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. However, results are both conflicting and difficult to interpret because of small sample sizes and associated poor statistical power. Although a recent meta-analysis was performed to analyze the difference in therapeutic response (TR) between IRI-administered cancer patients with different UGT1A1*28 genotypes [10], it only provided data on TR, a surrogate for the most important outcome: survival, and included studies of different cancers rather than completely focusing on patients with CRC. This meta-analysis will therefore assess effects of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism on the efficacy of IRI-based chemotherapy, not only including TR but also survival. Moreover, it focuses on CRC alone, which will allow an assessment of uniform regimens tied to a single clinical disease site. In addition, two more recent publications on CRC are included [12], [13].

Materials and ethods
etrieval of ublished tudies. A comprehensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was conducted from its inception through to July 2012 with the following search terms β€�irinotecanβ€™, β€�UGT1A1β€™, β€�UGT1A1 polymorphismβ€™, β€�UGT1A1*28β€™, β€�colorectal cancerβ€™, β€�chemotherapyβ€™, β€�responseβ€™, β€�progression-free survival (PFS)β€™, and β€�overall survival (OS)β€™. Furthermore, we screened titles and abstracts to identify relevant studies. Studies in abstract form or meeting reports, without publication of the full paper, were excluded.The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is relatively rare in Asian populations and the prevalence of homozygous UGT1A1*28 genotype is significantly greater in Caucasians than in Asian populations [32], [33], [34]. To reduce the heterogeneity among the analyzed studies, only studies involving mainly Caucasians populations were included in this meta-analysis.Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaStudies were included in the meta-analysis if (1) they were clinical trials or well characterized observational datasets, (2) they explored the association between UGT1A1*28 and clinical outcomes of IRI-based chemotherapy in patients with CRC, (3) there were sufficient data for TR (defined as a complete or partial response, using the WHO criteria [35] or the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (RECIST) [36]) or PFS/OS data were provided, and (4) they were published in English. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) case reports, (2) reviews and opinions, (3) allele frequency studies, (4) studies not involving CRC patients, (5) studies where outcome data were not presented in detail or which had not provided enough information to calculate relevant data, and (6) studies conducted only in non-Caucasian populations. When different publications with overlapping subjects were considered eligible, we only included the one with larger numbers of patients. Figure 1 summarizes the search methods, inclusion and exclusion steps.10.1371/journal.pone.0058489.g001Figure 1Flow diagram for study selection in meta-analysis.Data ExtractionThe following information was extracted from each eligible included publication: first authorβ€™s name, year of publication, country, primary race of patients, phase of clinical trial, number of patient, gender distribution, age (median or mean), source of population, polymorphism detection method, IRI dose, chemotherapy regimens, study design, response criteria, line of chemotherapy, and genotype data.Two or three different IRI-containing regimens were administered to patients in some studies [15], [20]. When possible, we analyzed the patients treated with each regimen as separate samples. Patients treated with different regimens were analyzed as a single study only if separate data was not available. Sample sizes abstracted reflect the total number of patients who received IRI, as some trials also included non-IRI treatment arm.Statistical AnalysisPRISMA guidelines were followed (showed in Checklist S1) [37]. Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate the association between UGT1A1*28 and TR. The OR was computed from the number of patients with and without TR after IRI-based chemotherapy. We evaluated PFS and OS based on pooled Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using published methods [38] because a meta-analysis of summary results is statistically as efficient as a joint analysis of individual participant data [39]. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochranβ€™s Chi-Squared test and the inconsistency index I2, with a significance level of P<0.05. We performed initial analyses with a fixed-effect model and confirmatory analyses with a random-effects model, if there was potential heterogeneity. We assessed potential publication bias by using a funnel plot and Eggerβ€™s test [40]. For meta-analysis that failed the Eggerβ€™s test (P<0.05), a trim and fill method was used to adjust for publication bias [41]. All statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (v5.0; Oxford, England) and Stata software (Stata Corporation, Texas).For TR, we compared the following: UGT1A1*28/*28 versus (vs) UGT1A1*1/*1 (homozygous model), UGT1A1*1/*28 vs UGT1A1*1/*1 (heterozygous model) and UGT1A1*28/*28 vs all others (recessive model). Two models (homozygous and heterozygous model) were examined in the analysis of PFS and OS. To assess the influence of IRI dose on the association between UGT1A1*28 and clinical outcomes, we carried out stratified analyses based on different IRI doses. In dose intensity analysis, 150 mg/m2 of IRI dose was set as the cutoff value between medium/high (High IRI) and low dose (Low IRI). In some studies [14], [20], [22], [23], the patients received different IRI doses at different time points and only combined data were available. The average dose was calculated to classify these studies.

Results
haracteristics of the tudies. Figure 1 shows the process of study selection. In total, 27 full-text studies were fully reviewed. Of these, five did not provide sufficient individualsβ€™ genotype data [24], [25], [26], [28], [29]. Three only provided a summary description of their results in the text [27], [30], [31]. Four analyzed only Asian populations and were excluded [42], [43], [44], [45]. Three combined CRC patients with those that had other cancers [46], [47], [48]. Thus, only 12 studies were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis.Characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. Methodologic components of study designs may be critically important to understand the meta-analyses results [49]; thus we utilize a modified set of criteria to report methodological issues and quality of the studies [50]. The criteria assessed study design, polymorphism detection method, combination regimens, Line of therapy, and grading systems for response (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0058489.t001Table 1Characteristics and methodological quality of studies included in meta analysis.StudyCountry, RacesaPhase of clinical trialNo.of patient (male%)AgebPopulation SourcecMutation detection methodsdregimeneIrinotecan dose (mg/m2)/scheduleResponse criteriafLine of regimensStudy designgclinical outcomeshLamas 2012 [12]Spain, UU100(63.4)67USPRFOLFIRI180/biweeklyRECISTFirst and second lineRTR, PFSiShulman 2011 [13]Israel, CI329(48.0)63MSPRTEGAFIRI, XELIRI, FOLFIRI, IFLU/UROSMartinez 2010 [14]Spain, CIII149(U)UMSequencingFOLFIRI, FUIRI80/weekly or180/biweeklyRECISTFirst lineRTR, OSiMcLeod 2010 [15]USA/UK/Canada, mainly CIII212(U)61MPYRSIFL, IROX100β€“125/weekly or 200/every 3 weeksUUPTR, PFS, OSBoige 2010 [16]France, UIII199(57.0)67.5MSPRFOLFIRI180/biweeklyWHOSecond and third linePTR, PFS, OSGlimelius 2011 [17]Sweden/UK/Norway, mainly CIII136(U)62MSPRFLIRI, Lv5FU-IRI180/biweeklyRECISTRTR, PFS, OSToffoli 2006 [18]Italy, CI250(64.8)61MPYRSFOLFIRI, mFOLFIRI180/biweeklyWHOFirst linePTR, PFS, OSRouits 2008 [19]France, UU44(69.3)60SPYRSmFOLFIRI180/biweeklyRECISTUUTR, PFSiKweekel 2008 [20]Netherlands, CIII218(62.8)61MPYRSCapeIRI, IRI250 or 350/every3 weeksRECISTFirst and second lineRTRRuzzo 2008 [21]Italy, CU146(55.6)61MSPRFOLFIRI180/biweeklyRECISTFirst linePTR, PFSRhodes 2007 [22]USA, mainly CU51(57.4)56MSequencingFOLFIRI, mIFL125 or 180/biweeklyUFirst lineUTRCarlini 2005 [23]USA, mainly CII62(55.0)61MSPRCapeIRI100 or 125/weeklyRECISTUPTRaC, Caucasian; U, Unknown.bmedian or mean age.cS, Single centre; M, Multicentre.dSPR, Sizing of PCR products; PYRS, Pyrosequencing; Sequencing, other DNA sequencing methods.eIR(I), irinotecan; 5FU, 5-fluorouracil; CAPe, capecitabine; OX(A), oxaliplatin; LV, leucovorin; XEL, xeloda; TEGAF, uracil/tegafur/LV.fRECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.gR, analysis was planned retrospectively; P, analysis was planned prospectively.hTR, therapeutic response; PFS, progression-free survival; OS, overall survival.iThese data were not available.Of the 12 studies, three did not clearly report the race of the participants [12], [16], [19], but they were conducted in Europe or America.

Discussion
hile the association between 11*28 and -related toxicity has been extensively studied, data are limited regarding the potential impact of the 11*28 genotype on tumor responsiveness and patient survival following  therapy [10]. ublished meta-analyses have demonstrated dose-dependent associations between 11*28 genotype and -induced neutropenia or diarrhea [51], [52], [53]. he .. ood and rug dministration in 2005 recommended that gene-related information be added to the drug product label and approved the diagnostic 11*28 test to identify homozygous patients advising a lower dose of  in these patients [54]. owever, a reduction in dosage might also be associated with reduced tumor response and/or increased morbidity [55]. he valuation of enomic pplications in ractice and revention () working group and some cost-effectiveness analyses have indicated that 11*28 genotyping will only be clinically useful if dosing  on basis of genotype improves the safety of  without compromising the efficacy of the therapy [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]. hus, whether 11*28 genotype is associated with clinical outcomes of -based chemotherapy is an important gap in existing knowledge to inform clinical utility [55], [56].
 previous meta-analysis [10] of 12 studies (8 studies [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [20], [21], [23] were included in our meta-analysis) was performed to analyze the difference in  between -administered cancer patients with different 11*28 genotypes. esults indicated that differences in  for all genotype comparisons were not statistically significant. ubgroup analyses based on  dose and tumor type ( and lung cancer) did not show any significant difference in terms of the association between 11 genotype and . he present meta-analysis assessed the association of 11*28 polymorphisms with clinical outcomes of -based chemotherapy in a single cancer site, . n our meta-analyses, the differences in  between the different 11*28 genotype patient groups also did not attain statistical significance. lso, in contrast to -induced toxicities, there was no convincing evidence to suggest that the association between 11*28 genotype and  is modified by  dose. his is consistent with the meta-analysis of ias et al [10], where no association between 11*28 genotypes and  response was found in an analysis across various tumor types including . imilar results were detected in association between 11*28 genotypes and . owever, the 11*28 allele showed significant or marginal association with poorer , especially in ow  subgroup of homozygous model.
ur  results are in the opposite direction of our original hypothesis. ossible explanations for why  could be lower in patients carrying the 11*28 allele include suboptimal treatment due to the severity of adverse effects and the decreased dose intensity resulting from frequent dose reduction or treatment delay [13], [59]. hese two parameters are intrinsically correlated but not necessarily consistent with one another [61].  is defined as the time from randomization to death caused by any reason and represents the gold standard metric for establishing efficacy. his typically requires phase  trials of large sample size with lengthy follow-up.  and  as the alternative end points for  occur earlier and can evaluate the effect of an intervention faster, at less cost with fewer trial subjects [62]. owever, rediction of  and  are more complicated because other factors, such as tumor-related factors, environmental factors, and patientβ€™s characteristics, should be considered [59]. ence,  and  may correlate with a real clinical endpoint () but do not necessarily have a guaranteed relationship. hat a reduction in  dosage among 11*28*28 patients with  may reduce the long-term survival (), but not influence on  and  is intriguing; however, an underlying mechanism needs to be clarified.
he study conducted by hulman et al was included in this meta-analysis, which may have driven the  findings due to its large sample size (329 cases). his study suffered in particular from an unspecified  dosage and thus was only marginally accepted based on its methodology. n additional meta-analysis excluding the study showed that the results of s were 1.09 (homozygous model) and 1.08 (heterozygous model), respectively, which were slightly different from the s in the overall estimate of 1.22 and 1.13. owever, the analysis failed to reach a statistical significance because of the insufficient power with the small sample size in this meta-analysis (only four studies involving 222 patients were analyzed for the homozygous model and 564 cases for heterozygous model). hus, while our  relationship is intriguing, much more validation is needed.
n our meta-analysis, three parameters (,  and ) were used to assess the influence of 11*28 polymorphism on clinical outcomes. his presents a more comprehensive assessment than a single parameter as a prior meta-analysis had performed [61]. oreover, our study only focused on , reducing the potential heterogeneity across the studies. n addition, we paid attention to methodological components of study designs in the literature. he certain items such as study design, polymorphism detection method, combination regimens, ine of therapy, and grading systems for response, are reflective of methodological and reporting quality of the studies. t is beneficial to analyze the heterogeneity in this meta-analysis and improve the chances to replicate initial significant findings in subsequent pharmacogenetic studies [50].
here are limitations of this analysis. irstly, some studies were excluded from our analysis because of lack of individual genotype data [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]; this could cause some bias in our estimates, but was unlikely to change our major conclusions, as these excluded studies showed no association between 11*28 polymorphism and either  or  in aucasians. econdly, there is inherent heterogeneity to all meta-analyses. n the analyzed studies, there were differences in study design, the source of population,  dose, polymorphism detection method, response grade criteria, therapeutic regimens, line of therapy, and performance status of patients. dditionally, although the difference in distribution of stage at diagnosis across studies will contribute to the heterogeneity in our meta-analysis, we did not perform a stratified subgroup analysis on stage at diagnosis because only three studies [13], [18], [21] provided data on stage and none explored the association between 11*28 and clinical outcomes of different stage at diagnosis. ikewise, other stratified subgroup analyses such as on the localization of primary tumor (six studies reported the localization of primary tumor [12], [14], [17], [18], [19], [20], but they did not provided the separated outcome data) could not be conducted. hus, we performed initial analyses using a fixed-effects model and confirmatory analyses using a random-effects model. esults were similar between these two methods. hirdly, articles included in this metaβ€“analysis were restricted to nglish publishing studies. rticles with potentially high-quality data in other languages were excluded because of anticipated difficulties in obtaining accurate medical translation.
lthough meta-analysis can synthesize the results of multiple studies into a summary of results, it is different from a combined analysis which uses the full information of individual patient data and can provide more comprehensive assessment. ur meta-analysis was useful because the collection of detailed information of each clinical trial was impractical and in some cases, not allowable due to local ethics board concerns [63].
n summary, this meta-analysis provided modest evidence for the association between 11*28 polymorphism and  of -based chemotherapy in . 11*28 polymorphism cannot be considered a reliable predictor of  and  to -based chemotherapy in patients with . n contrast, the  may be affected by 11*28 status; the 11*28*/28 patients with  have a worse  after lower-dose  therapy. he clinical significance of this last finding requires replication and additional research. n particular, as  metabolism is complex, numerous genes in addition to 11 should be interrogated [27].Discussion
While the association between UGT1A1*28 and IRI-related toxicity has been extensively studied, data are limited regarding the potential impact of the UGT1A1*28 genotype on tumor responsiveness and patient survival following IRI therapy [10]. Published meta-analyses have demonstrated dose-dependent associations between UGT1A1*28 genotype and IRI-induced neutropenia or diarrhea [51], [52], [53]. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005 recommended that gene-related information be added to the drug product label and approved the diagnostic UGT1A1*28 test to identify homozygous patients advising a lower dose of IRI in these patients [54]. However, a reduction in dosage might also be associated with reduced tumor response and/or increased morbidity [55]. The Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) working group and some cost-effectiveness analyses have indicated that UGT1A1*28 genotyping will only be clinically useful if dosing IRI on basis of genotype improves the safety of IRI without compromising the efficacy of the therapy [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]. Thus, whether UGT1A1*28 genotype is associated with clinical outcomes of IRI-based chemotherapy is an important gap in existing knowledge to inform clinical utility [55], [56].
A previous meta-analysis [10] of 12 studies (8 studies [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [20], [21], [23] were included in our meta-analysis) was performed to analyze the difference in TR between IRI-administered cancer patients with different UGT1A1*28 genotypes. Results indicated that differences in TR for all genotype comparisons were not statistically significant. Subgroup analyses based on IRI dose and tumor type (CRC and lung cancer) did not show any significant difference in terms of the association between UGT1A1 genotype and TR. The present meta-analysis assessed the association of UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms with clinical outcomes of IRI-based chemotherapy in a single cancer site, CRC. In our meta-analyses, the differences in TR between the different UGT1A1*28 genotype patient groups also did not attain statistical significance. Also, in contrast to IRI-induced toxicities, there was no convincing evidence to suggest that the association between UGT1A1*28 genotype and TR is modified by IRI dose. This is consistent with the meta-analysis of Dias et al [10], where no association between UGT1A1*28 genotypes and IRI response was found in an analysis across various tumor types including CRC. Similar results were detected in association between UGT1A1*28 genotypes and PFS. However, the UGT1A1*28 allele showed significant or marginal association with poorer OS, especially in Low IRI subgroup of homozygous model.
Our OS results are in the opposite direction of our original hypothesis. Possible explanations for why OS could be lower in patients carrying the UGT1A1*28 allele include suboptimal treatment due to the severity of adverse effects and the decreased dose intensity resulting from frequent dose reduction or treatment delay [13], [59]. These two parameters are intrinsically correlated but not necessarily consistent with one another [61]. OS is defined as the time from randomization to death caused by any reason and represents the gold standard metric for establishing efficacy. This typically requires phase III trials of large sample size with lengthy follow-up. TR and PFS as the alternative end points for OS occur earlier and can evaluate the effect of an intervention faster, at less cost with fewer trial subjects [62]. However, Prediction of TR and PFS are more complicated because other factors, such as tumor-related factors, environmental factors, and patientβ€™s characteristics, should be considered [59]. Hence, TR and PFS may correlate with a real clinical endpoint (OS) but do not necessarily have a guaranteed relationship. That a reduction in IRI dosage among UGT1A1*28*28 patients with CRC may reduce the long-term survival (OS), but not influence on TR and FPS is intriguing; however, an underlying mechanism needs to be clarified.
The study conducted by Shulman et al was included in this meta-analysis, which may have driven the OS findings due to its large sample size (329 cases). This study suffered in particular from an unspecified IRI dosage and thus was only marginally accepted based on its methodology. An additional meta-analysis excluding the study showed that the results of HRs were 1.09 (homozygous model) and 1.08 (heterozygous model), respectively, which were slightly different from the HRs in the overall estimate of 1.22 and 1.13. However, the analysis failed to reach a statistical significance because of the insufficient power with the small sample size in this meta-analysis (only four studies involving 222 patients were analyzed for the homozygous model and 564 cases for heterozygous model). Thus, while our OS relationship is intriguing, much more validation is needed.
In our meta-analysis, three parameters (TR, PFS and OS) were used to assess the influence of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism on clinical outcomes. This presents a more comprehensive assessment than a single parameter as a prior meta-analysis had performed [61]. Moreover, our study only focused on CRC, reducing the potential heterogeneity across the studies. In addition, we paid attention to methodological components of study designs in the literature. The certain items such as study design, polymorphism detection method, combination regimens, Line of therapy, and grading systems for response, are reflective of methodological and reporting quality of the studies. It is beneficial to analyze the heterogeneity in this meta-analysis and improve the chances to replicate initial significant findings in subsequent pharmacogenetic studies [50].
There are limitations of this analysis. Firstly, some studies were excluded from our analysis because of lack of individual genotype data [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]; this could cause some bias in our estimates, but was unlikely to change our major conclusions, as these excluded studies showed no association between UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and either TR or PFS in Caucasians. Secondly, there is inherent heterogeneity to all meta-analyses. In the analyzed studies, there were differences in study design, the source of population, IRI dose, polymorphism detection method, response grade criteria, therapeutic regimens, line of therapy, and performance status of patients. Additionally, although the difference in distribution of stage at diagnosis across studies will contribute to the heterogeneity in our meta-analysis, we did not perform a stratified subgroup analysis on stage at diagnosis because only three studies [13], [18], [21] provided data on stage and none explored the association between UGT1A1*28 and clinical outcomes of different stage at diagnosis. Likewise, other stratified subgroup analyses such as on the localization of primary tumor (six studies reported the localization of primary tumor [12], [14], [17], [18], [19], [20], but they did not provided the separated outcome data) could not be conducted. Thus, we performed initial analyses using a fixed-effects model and confirmatory analyses using a random-effects model. Results were similar between these two methods. Thirdly, articles included in this metaβ€“analysis were restricted to English publishing studies. Articles with potentially high-quality data in other languages were excluded because of anticipated difficulties in obtaining accurate medical translation.
Although meta-analysis can synthesize the results of multiple studies into a summary of results, it is different from a combined analysis which uses the full information of individual patient data and can provide more comprehensive assessment. Our meta-analysis was useful because the collection of detailed information of each clinical trial was impractical and in some cases, not allowable due to local ethics board concerns [63].
In summary, this meta-analysis provided modest evidence for the association between UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and OS of IRI-based chemotherapy in CRC. UGT1A1*28 polymorphism cannot be considered a reliable predictor of TR and PFS to IRI-based chemotherapy in patients with CRC. In contrast, the OS may be affected by UGT1A1*28 status; the UGT1A1*28*/28 patients with CRC have a worse OS after lower-dose IRI therapy. The clinical significance of this last finding requires replication and additional research. In particular, as IRI metabolism is complex, numerous genes in addition to UGT1A1 should be interrogated [27].
