It would be difficult to be a anadian and be unaware of the controversy regarding endovascular treatment for multiple sclerosis (). r. aolo amboni, an talian physician, has hypothesized that  is caused by a newly discovered abnormality of venous drainage from the brain that he has called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (), and that endovascular treatment of  can markedly improve the symptoms of .1,2 he endovascular treatment has been given the rather sensational name β€�liberation procedure,β€� invoking the notion of  β€�setting free.β€� he overwhelming majority of  researchers dismiss r. amboniβ€™s findings because they fly in the face of what is known about the etiology of , and because of questions about the scientific quality of r. amboniβ€™s work. is studies of the association between  and  have not been consistently replicated, and his trial addressing the effectiveness of endovascular treatment was not randomized. s well, although amboni found no serious complications in 65  patients undergoing angioplasty of the jugular veins, no large-scale study of complications has been reported. hese are important and valid criticisms.It would be difficult to be a Canadian and be unaware of the controversy regarding endovascular treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr. Paolo Zamboni, an Italian physician, has hypothesized that MS is caused by a newly discovered abnormality of venous drainage from the brain that he has called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), and that endovascular treatment of CCSVI can markedly improve the symptoms of MS.1,2 The endovascular treatment has been given the rather sensational name β€�liberation procedure,β€� invoking the notion of  β€�setting free.β€� The overwhelming majority of MS researchers dismiss Dr. Zamboniβ€™s findings because they fly in the face of what is known about the etiology of MS, and because of questions about the scientific quality of Dr. Zamboniβ€™s work. His studies of the association between CCSVI and MS have not been consistently replicated, and his trial addressing the effectiveness of endovascular treatment was not randomized. As well, although Zamboni found no serious complications in 65 MS patients undergoing angioplasty of the jugular veins, no large-scale study of complications has been reported. These are important and valid criticisms.

In September of this year they released a summary of the deliberations of a β€�Joint Invitational Meetingβ€� of 15 clinical and scientific experts, 5 employees of the CIHR, 3 employees of the MS Society, and one unidentified person with MS. The panel examined the scientific literature relating CCSVI and MS, and decided that the evidence linking CCSVI and MS was so unconvincing that it would be inappropriate at this time to perform a clinical trial examining the benefits and risks of endovascular treatment as a therapy for MS.6

Too often, health care interventions are introduced on the basis of poor scientific evidence. herefore, what the  and  ociety have attempted to do seems admirable to those of us who are proponents of evidence-based health care and evidence-informed policy-making.  review and summary of all research that is relevant to important health policy decisions by unbiased experts can be used by politicians and policy-makers to make policy decisions, in this case whether to fund endovascular treatment for , either as part of a randomized trial or through the publicly funded health care system. owever, we suggest that there are important lessons to be learned from this panelβ€™s experience that should be considered when constituting future panels that address other issues that are at the intersection of science, advocacy and policy-making.Too often, health care interventions are introduced on the basis of poor scientific evidence.

Concerns have been raised about the membership of the expert panel.7 o proponents of the liberation procedure participated in the nvitational eeting, which seems odd. ost scientific experts have some degree of conflict of interest, and these are usually dealt with by publicly declaring them, not by excluding a particular point of view from a panel. onversely, the potential conflicts of interest of the individuals who were on the panel were not described in the report, thus allowing some to accuse the  of attempting to hide their potential biases.8Concerns have been raised about the membership of the expert panel.7 No proponents of the liberation procedure participated in the Invitational Meeting, which seems odd.

The rationale for this recommendation is sensible: one should not expose MS patients to the risks of endovascular therapyβ€”which, although rare, can be fatal9,10β€” if there is no rational scientific reason to think that CCSVI causes MS. However, the panel spent little time either justifying their controversial recommendation or discussing potentially opposing points of view. We believe that both the panelβ€™s approach to the problem and its membership were too narrow to completely fulfill its mandate.

The first two questions are largely ones of science, and are best addressed by highly qualified experts who represent the diversity of views in the scientific community. owever, we believe that although the third question must be informed by science, it should be addressed using a broader perspective.  clinical trial of endovascular treatment funded by the  or provincial governments would consume public resources, which are clearly limited. iven the controversy, and given the way this issue has galvanized the public, the decision about whether to conduct a clinical trial should be informed by the public. e believe that members of the public, beyond 3 employees of the  ociety and one anonymous person with , should have been included on the oint nvitational eeting panel.  y β€�members of the public,β€� we do not mean only patients with multiple sclerosis or advocates for  patients, but also thoughtful citizens without  who can consider all points of view, deliberate about them, and contribute to informed recommendations.The first two questions are largely ones of science, and are best addressed by highly qualified experts who represent the diversity of views in the scientific community.

If half a dozen or so such individuals had participated in the deliberations, they might have asked questions about why proponents of the liberation procedure were not members of the panel, and they would have contributed greatly to the discussion about the appropriateness of a clinical trial in the face of poor scientific evidence supporting the  hypothesis and uncertainty about the risks of endovascular therapy (which appear to vary depending upon whether or not a stent is inserted). hey would likely have encouraged the panel to more fully articulate the reasons why a clinical trial should not (or possibly should) be conducted now, and might have had different views about how to balance information about the risks and potential benefits of angioplasty.  number of anadians are now using their own resources to travel to other countries to undergo endovascular treatment, performed by surgical teams whose quality standards are not always clear. ould these patients be better off, and policy-makers and the public better informed, if a randomized trial were conducted now?  f patients are fully informed about current doubts regarding the association of  and , as well as the limitations of amboniβ€™s non-randomized trial of endovascular treatment, and the potential side-effects of endovascular treatment, should they be given the opportunity of participating in a trial now? f course, surgeons and interventional radiologists should not participate in the trial if they feel that the current evidence suggests they are likely to do more harm than good to their patients. owever, we know of reputable anadian vascular surgeons who would operate on  patients in the context of a randomized trial.If half a dozen or so such individuals had participated in the deliberations, they might have asked questions about why proponents of the liberation procedure were not members of the panel, and they would have contributed greatly to the discussion about the appropriateness of a clinical trial in the face of poor scientific evidence supporting the CCSVI hypothesis and uncertainty about the risks of endovascular therapy (which appear to vary depending upon whether or not a stent is inserted).

Of course, surgeons and interventional radiologists should not participate in the trial if they feel that the current evidence suggests they are likely to do more harm than good to their patients. However, we know of reputable Canadian vascular surgeons who would operate on MS patients in the context of a randomized trial.

Even had greater public membership on the panel not changed the recommendations made in the report at all, or had the committee not been able to come to a consensus, the very fact that members of the public were on the committee would likely have increased the legitimacy of the report in the eyes of the public (although not in everyoneβ€™s).Even had greater public membership on the panel not changed the recommendations made in the report at all, or had the committee not been able to come to a consensus, the very fact that members of the public were on the committee would likely have increased the legitimacy of the report in the eyes of the public (although not in everyoneβ€™s).
