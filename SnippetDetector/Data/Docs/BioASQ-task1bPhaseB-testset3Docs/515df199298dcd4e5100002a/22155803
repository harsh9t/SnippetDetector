Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) by an unknown pathogenesis. MR venography and postmortem studies have demonstrated a topographic correspondence between multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques and the cerebral venous system pathology. In recent observational studies performed on patients from distinctive gene pools, the prevalence of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in MS ranged from 56% to 100%. Endovascular treatment (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without stenting) of CCSVI was reported to be feasible with a minor complication rate. In 4 patients with different forms of multiple sclerosis venography was performed that revealed stenosis of the proximal region of the jugular vein (right or left). Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) was performed in all patients. There were no complications and mean stenosis was reduced after PTA from 59.75% to 36.75%. Follow-up included clinical observations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all the cases we observed positive remission of the disease, the first ever documented case of MRI index improvement. PTA seems to be an effective treatment for patients with CCVI and multiple sclerosis, However, randomized studies are warranted to establish the efficacy of this new treatment for MS.
