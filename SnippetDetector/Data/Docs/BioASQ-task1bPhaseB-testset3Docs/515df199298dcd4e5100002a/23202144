OBJECTIVE: Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) was recently described in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The hypothesis of the vascular aetiology provides a new approach in the investigation and treatment of MS. METHODS: Our open-label study included 94 MS patients who fulfilled ultrasound sonographic criteria required for CCSVI. The internal jugular and/or azygous veins by a catheter venography were dilated. RESULTS: In 34.8% of the patients unilateral, in 65.2% bilateral venous abnormalities and in 2.1% no luminal obstructions were demonstrated. The patient group with the higher disability score had a significantly higher number of venous lesions (P < 0.005). Significant improvement of clinical disability in relapsing-remitting patients was (P < 0.001) achieved. In our study no stents were used. Re-stenosis occurred in 21.7% of the patients. CONCLUSION: The number of venous narrowings is higher in more disabled patients. A significant improvement in clinical disability in the relapsing-remitting group was observed.
