For more complete characterization of DNA-predicted proteins (including their posttranslational modifications) a "top-down" approach using high-resolution tandem MS is forwarded here by its application to methanogens in both hypothesis-driven and discovery modes, with the latter dependent on new automation benchmarks for intact proteins. With proteins isolated from ribosomes and whole-cell lysates of Methanococcus jannaschii (approximately 1,800 genes) using a 2D protein fractionation method, 72 gene products were identified and characterized with 100% sequence coverage via automated fragmentation of intact protein ions in a custom quadrupole/Fourier transform hybrid mass spectrometer. Three incorrect start sites and two modifications were found, with one of each determined for MJ0556, a 20-kDa protein with an unknown methylation at approximately 50% occupancy in stationary phase cells. The separation approach combined with the quadrupole/Fourier transform hybrid mass spectrometer allowed targeted and efficient comparison of histones from M. jannaschii, Methanosarcina acetivorans (largest Archaeal genome, 5.8 Mb), and yeast. This finding revealed a striking difference in the posttranslational regulation of DNA packaging in Eukarya vs. the Archaea. This study illustrates a significant evolutionary step for the MS tools available for characterization of WT proteins from complex proteomes without proteolysis.
