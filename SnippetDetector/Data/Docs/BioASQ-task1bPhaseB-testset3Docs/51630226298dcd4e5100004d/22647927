Linker histone H1 is a major chromatin component that binds internucleosomal DNA and mediates the folding of nucleosomes into a higher-order structure, namely the 30-nm chromatin fiber. Multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) of core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 have been identified and their important contribution to the regulation of chromatin structure and function is firmly established. In contrast, little is known about histone H1 modifications and their function. Here we address this question in Drosophila melanogaster, which, in contrast to most eukaryotic species, contains a single histone H1 variant, dH1. For this purpose, we combined bottom-up and top-down mass-spectrometry strategies. Our results indicated that dH1 is extensively modified by phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination, with most PTMs falling in the N-terminal domain. Interestingly, several dH1 N-terminal modifications have also been reported in specific human and/or mouse H1 variants, suggesting that they have conserved functions. In this regard, we also provide evidence for the contribution of one of such conserved PTMs, dimethylation of K27, to heterochromatin organization during mitosis. Furthermore, our results also identified multiple dH1 isoforms carrying several phosphorylations and/or methylations, illustrating the high structural heterogeneity of dH1. In particular, we identified several non-CDK sites at the N-terminal domain that appear to be hierarchically phosphorylated. This study provides the most comprehensive PTM characterization of any histone H1 variant to date.
