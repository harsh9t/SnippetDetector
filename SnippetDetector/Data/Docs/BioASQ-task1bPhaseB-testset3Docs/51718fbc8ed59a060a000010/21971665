microRNAs (miRs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that are aberrantly             expressed in various carcinomas. miR-152 and miR-148a have not been comprehensively             investigated in ovarian cancer. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the             role of miR-152 and miR-148a in epithelial ovarian cancer. Total RNA was extracted             from tissues of 78 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, 17 normal ovarian             epithelium tissues and two ovarian cancer cell lines. Using quantitative real-time             PCR (qRT-PCR) followed by the 2-ΔΔCT method for calculating the results, we found             that the expression levels of miR-152 were significantly decreased in ovarian             cancer tissues compared to normal ovarian epithelium tissues (p<0.05). However,             although the expression of miR-148a was also decreased in 65% of patients, no             statistically significant difference in expression was found. A strong correlation             was found between the expression of miR-152 and miR-148a (p<0.001, Pearson's             correlation). The relationship between miR-152 or miR-148a expression levels in             ovarian cancer and clinicopathological features, response to therapy and short-term             survival was analyzed and the results showed that no correlation existed. In addition,             we found that both miR-152 and miR-148a were down-regulated in ovarian cancer             cell lines. After miR-152 or miR-148a mimics were transfected into ovarian cancer             cell lines, the MTT cell proliferation assay showed that cell proliferation was             significantly inhibited. Taken together, miR-152 and miR-148a may be involved             in the carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer through deregulation of cell proliferation.             They may be novel biomarkers for early detection or therapeutic targets of ovarian             cancer.
