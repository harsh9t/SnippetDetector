INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is still the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Even though revascularization strategies such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) as well as drug therapy have significantly reduced mortality, about 30% of patients will develop chronic heart failure over time. Ischemic heart disease and heart failure are characterized by an adverse remodeling of the heart, featuring cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, increased fibrosis and capillary rarification. AREAS COVERED: Beside an assessment of current vector systems, this review focuses on potential target genes affecting angiogenesis/arteriogenesis and contractility. The potential of micro RNA (miRNA) modulation for the de-repression of survival and pro-angiogenic genes is discussed. Since gene therapy of the target region is preferable to avoid systemic contamination, application routes are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: miRNAs are a promising new development for successful gene therapy, especially for acute myocardial infarction since their miRNA antagonists are easy to apply and appear to be selectively absorbed by the ischemic myocardial tissue. Rapid uptake and prolonged presence of known antimirs and antagomirs support this notion. For ischemic heart disease the most promising gene therapeutic approach seems to be the regional intravenous application of suitable AAV vectors and vascular growth factors, providing the full scope of angiogenesis, vessel maturation and collateral growth optionally combined with genes enhancing contractility.
