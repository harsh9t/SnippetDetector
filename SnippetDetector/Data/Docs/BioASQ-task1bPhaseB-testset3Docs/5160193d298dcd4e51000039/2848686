The inotropic effect of the physiological level of TRH on isolated guinea pig cardiac muscle was studied using a force transducer and standard microelectrode techniques. TRH increased the contractile force of muscles dose-dependently without changing the time course of contraction in normal Tyrode and a high K+ (27 mM) solution. The positive inotropic effect of TRH was associated with an augmentation of slow action potentials in high K+ solution and was reduced in the presence of diltiazem, verapamil, and manganese. TRH potentiated the response of contractile force to increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration. The inotropic effect of TRH was suppressed by metoclopramide, phentolamine, and cimetidine, but was not affected by propranolol. TRH increased the contractile force even in the myocardium of reserpinized guinea pig. It is suggested that TRH has a positive inotropic effect at least partly due to an increase in the slow inward Ca2+ current.
