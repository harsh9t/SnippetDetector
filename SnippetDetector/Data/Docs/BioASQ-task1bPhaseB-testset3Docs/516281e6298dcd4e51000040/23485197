Introduction
he protozoan parasite rypanosoma
brucei is the etiological agent of frican sleeping sickness,
also known as uman frican rypanosomiasis (), which is transmitted
by the bite of an infected tsetse fly. he disease is usually fatal
if left untreated and is estimated to be responsible for around 10000
deaths per annum in sub-aharan frica.1 urrent treatments are expensive, toxic and difficult to administer,
leaving an urgent unmet need for new therapeutic agents.2. brucei has a complex digenetic
lifecycle between an insect vector and a mammalian host, and its ability
to adapt its proteome to these disparate environments is essential
to its survival and virulence. uring the early stages of an infection,
the clinically relevant bloodstream form of the parasite proliferates
in the blood and lymph of the human host, then in the second stage
enters the cerebral-spinal fluid and brain, resulting in coma and
death. hen a tsetse fly feeds on an infected host, the parasite is
ingested with the blood meal, triggering parasite differentiation
into the procyclic form to enable survival in its new environment.
oth the procyclic form and bloodstream form of the parasite may
be cultured in vitro. e have recently quantified
the changes in protein expression between the procyclic and bloodstream
form lifecycle stages using  labeling of procyclic cells, demonstrating
that about 10% of the observed proteome is differentially regulated
by more than 5-fold.3 he fold-change in
protein level showed a strong correlation (earson correlation 0.86)
to changes in m. RNA level recorded by transcriptomic studies,4 despite the atypical mechanism of gene expression
in trypanosomes, where genes are transcribed in large polycistronic
units that are trans-spliced into mature mRNAs for translation, with
mRNA abundance controlled by stability.5
There is evidence that protein phosphorylation may be important
in T. brucei; Nett et al. used sequential strong-cation
exchange (SCX) and TiO2 enrichment of phosphopeptides derived
from the cytosolic fraction of bloodstream form parasites to identify
1204 phosphorylation sites on 491 proteins,6 and immunoprecipitation with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies to identify
34 phosphotyrosine sites induced in response to the treatment of procyclic
form cells with hydrogen peroxide.7 However,
to date, there has been no quantitative comparison of the phosphoproteomes
of the two lifecycle stages. We set out to define the global protein
phosphorylation status of the two lifecycle stages to explore the
biological processes that might be modulated by phosphorylation, and
to highlight stage-specific phosphorylation changes. Here, we report
a global quantitative phosphoproteomic study of bloodstream and procyclic
form Trypanosoma brucei using SILAC labeling of each
lifecycles stage that identifies 9314 previously unidentified phosphorylation
sites. The results show that differential phosphorylation is widespread
between the procyclic and bloodstream form and that it adds significant
complexity to the changes in the proteome.

Experimental ection
ell ulture
edia. HMI9-T, a modification of the original IMDM-based HMI-9,8 uses 56 ΞΌM 1-thioglycerol in place of 200
ΞΌM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM glutaMAX I (Invitrogen) in place
of 4 mM l-glutamine, and contains 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (PAA). Similarly, HMI11-T is a modification of the original
HMI11 (HMI-9 lacking serum plus)8 that
use 56 ΞΌM 1-thioglycerol and 2 mM glutaMAX I with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum.HMI11-SILAC β€“ RK was prepared in
the same way as HMI11-T but using IMDM depleted of l-Arginine, l-Lysine (Sigma) and 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (10 kDa molecular weight cutoff, PAA) and was supplemented with
4 mg/L folic acid. The HMI11-SILAC β€“ RK was supplemented with
either normal l-Arginine and l-Lysine (HMI11-SILAC
+ R0K0), or with l-Arginine Uβ€“13C6 and l-Lysine 4,4,5,5-2H4 (HMI11-SILAC + R6K4, Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories) at 30% of the original HMI11 concentration (120 and
240 ΞΌM respectively) unless otherwise stated. Original SDM-79
medium9 and SILAC SDM-79 medium (SDM-79
+ R6K6) were prepared as described previously.3Cell CultureProcyclic form Trypanosoma brucei Lister 427 clone 29.13.6 cells were grown
at 28 Β°C without CO2 in SDM-79 in the presence of
15 ΞΌg/mL G418 and 50 ΞΌg/mL hygromycin. Culture adapted
strain Lister 427 monomorphic bloodstream form T. brucei (MITat 1.2, expressing VSG221) were cultured in HMI-9T containing
2.5 ΞΌg/mL G418 at 37 Β°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Both cell lines have been genetically modified to express the T7 RNA
polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein, as described by
Wirtz et al.10 Cell dimensions were measured
using a CASY cell counter.For the growth curves, the T. brucei bloodstream form cells were washed twice in 10
mL HMI11-SILAC β€“ RK and resuspended at 5 Γ— 104 cells/mL in either HMI-9T or HMI11-SILAC supplemented with R0K0 at 30% of the original HMI11 concentration.
Cells were counted using a Neubauer chamber and phase contrast microscope,
and the cultures were diluted 100-fold every two days. After 10 days
samples were collected for analysis by light microscopy.For
SILAC labeling, T. brucei bloodstream form log-phase
cells were diluted 10000-fold into HMI11-SILAC + R6K4. Cells were harvested after 3 days growth at 2.5 Γ— 106 cells/mL. SILAC labeling of T. brucei procyclic
form cells was performed in SDM-79 + R6K6 as
described previously.3Cells were
harvested by centrifugation and hypotonically lysed at 5 Γ— 109 cells/mL for 5 min on ice in the presence 0.1 ΞΌM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptone
(TLCK), 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenyl-methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
1 ΞΌg/mL leupeptin, 1 ΞΌg/mL aprotinin and Phosphatase Inhibitor
Mixture II (Calbiochem). The protein concentration was determined
by BCA assay (Pierce) to be β�Ό5 mg/mL from each cell type. Samples
were aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at β�’80 Β°C prior
to subsequent processing.MicroscopyBloodstream form cells
at late log phase grown in either HMI9-T or HMI11-SILAC + R0K0 for 10 days were washed in 10 mL phosphate buffer saline
at 800 Γ— g at 4 Β°C, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate buffered saline at 4 Β°C for 30 min, and placed on
a coverslip. After air-drying the coverslips were washed in phosphate
buffered saline and mounted onto slides. The phase contrast images
were collected in a Zeiss Axioplan microscope.Estimating Efficiency of
SILAC LabelingBloodstream form cells were grown in HMI11-SILAC
+ R6K4 for 11β€“12 cell divisions and hypotonically
lysed as described above. To reduce the sample complexity the proteins
were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and a band corresponding to 25β€“50
kDa molecular weight range was excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic
digest prior to analysis by LCβ€“MS/MS. Ten peptides were chosen
at random and the relative abundance of the major isotopic peak of
heavy (arginine-13C6/lysine-2H4) and light (arginine-12C6/lysine-1H4) forms were measured using the extracted ion
chromatogram function in Excalibur (Thermo Scientific).Rodent Infectivity
StudiesBloodstream form cells were grown in HMI9-T or HMI11-SILAC
+ R0K0 for >14 days prior to inoculation
of female Balbc mice (three per condition) by inter peritoneal injection
of 1 Γ— 103, 1 Γ— 104 or 1 Γ— 105 cells in the same media. Daily tail bleeds were used to monitor
the number of parasites in the bloodstream using a heamocytometer,
and animals were euthanized when the parasite burden exceeded 5 Γ—
108 cells/mL prior to overt distress.Comparative
Proteomic AnalysisA 1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown
in light-SILAC media and bloodstream form cells grown in heavy-SILAC
media was solubilized with SDS and tryptic peptides were generated
by FASP. Peptides were fractionated by SCX prior to analysis by liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as described previously,3 except only 6 SCX fractions were analyzed and
technical duplicates were not performed. The previously reported the
analysis of a 1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown in heavy-SILAC
media and bloodstream form cells grown in light-SILAC media, consisting
of technical duplicates of eight SCX fractions and ten SDS-PAGE fractions,3 was reprocessed to ensure accurate comparison
with the current data.Filter Aided Sample PreparationPeptide samples for analysis by mass spectrometry were prepared by
modification of the filter-aided sample preparation procedure (FASP).11 Briefly, samples were defrosted and combined
according to the experiment design to give a total of 2.5 Γ— 109 lysed cells (0.5 mL), solubilized with 4% SDS and then reductively
alkylated in a 30000 molecular weight cutoff vertical spin filtration
unit (Vivascience) using the FASP procedure adapted for the larger
volumes used here. The sample was digested with 1:100 ratio (w/w)
of trypsin gold (Promega) in the filtration unit for 18 h at 37 Β°C,
tryptic peptides were eluted by centrifugation, and the filter washed
sequentially with 1 mL of 50 mM NH4HCO3 and
1 mL of 0.5 M NaCl. The combined eluent was desalted using a 500 mg
C18 cartridge (SepPak, Waters) and lyophilized.Strong
Cation Exchange ChromatographyStrong cation exchange (SCX)
was performed on an Agilent 1120 compact LC using a 3.0 Γ— 200
mm 5 ΞΌm polysulfethyl aspartamide column (Poly LC) with a flow
rate of 350 ΞΌL/min and detection at 220 nm. Phosphopeptides
were enriched using the method of Beausoleil et al.12 Dried peptides were dissolved in 200 ΞΌL of solvent
A (5 mM KHPO4 pH 2.7, 30% MeCN) and separated by salt gradient
consisting of 5 min at 100% solvent A, a 15 min gradient to 15% solvent
B (solvent A + 0.35 M KCl), 1 min gradient to 100% B, 15 min at 100%
B, and a 5 min gradient to 100% A. Fractions of 0.7 mL were collected
throughout the run and combined into 8 fractions of equal peptide
content based on their absorbance at 220 nm. Combined fractions were
lyophilized prior to TiO2 enrichment.TiO2 Enrichment of PhosphopeptidesPhosphopeptides were enriched
using TiO2 in batch mode in the presence of 5% TFA and
1 M glycolic acid.13 Briefly, lyophilized
peptides were resuspended in 80% MeCN, 5% TFA, 1 M glycolic acid prior
to incubation for 15 min with TiO2 beads (GL Sciences)
that were prewashed in the same solution. Beads were recovered by
centrifugation at 700 Γ— g for 1 min, washed three
times in 80% MeCN, 5% TFA and eluted twice in 0.6% NH3 (aq).
The combined eluents were lyophilized and stored at β�’20 Β°C
prior to analysis.Mass Spectrometry Data AcquisitionLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was performed by the
FingerPrints Proteomic Facility at the University of Dundee. Liquid
chromatography was performed on a fully automated Ultimate U3000 Nano
LC System (Dionex) fitted with a 1 Γ— 5 mm PepMap C18 trap column and a 75 ΞΌm Γ— 15 cm reverse phase PepMap
C18 nanocolumn (LC Packings, Dionex). Samples were loaded
in 0.1% formic acid (buffer A) and separated using a binary gradient
consisting of buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (90% MeCN,
0.08% formic acid). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from
5 to 40% buffer B over 65 min. The HPLC system was coupled to an LTQ
Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped
with a Proxeon nanospray ion source. For phosphoproteomic analysis,
the mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent mode to perform
a survey scan over a range 335β€“1800 m/z in the Orbitrap analyzer (R = 60000),
with each MS scan triggering 15 MS2 acquisitions of the
15 most intense ions using multistage activation on the neutral loss
of 98 and 49 thomsons in the LTQ ion trap.14 The Orbitrap mass analyzer was internally calibrated on the fly
using the lock mass of polydimethylcyclosiloxane at m/z 445.120025.For proteomic analysis, the
HPLC gradient was increased to 145 min and the mass spectrometer was
operated in data dependent mode with each MS scan triggering 15 MS2 acquisitions of the 15 most intense ions in the LTQ ion trap.Data ProcessingData was processed using MaxQuant15 version 1.3.0.5 which incorporates the Andromeda
search engine.16 Proteins were identified
by searching a protein sequence database containing T. brucei
brucei 927 annotated proteins (Version 4.0, downloaded from
TriTrypDB,17http://www.tritrypdb.org/) supplemented with the VSG221 sequence and frequently observed contaminants
(porcine trypsin, bovine serum albumins and mammalian keratins) that
contains a total of 10,081 protein sequences. Search parameters specified
an MS tolerance of 6 ppm, an MS/MS tolerance at 0.5 Da and full trypsin
specificity, allowing for up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation
of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionines, N-terminal protein acetylation and N-pyroglutamate
were allowed as variable modifications. Phosphoproteomic analysis
included phosophorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine as additional
variable modifications. Peptides were required to be at least 7 amino
acids in length and a MaxQuant score >5, with false discovery rates
(FDRs) of 0.01 calculated at the levels of peptides, proteins and
modification sites based on the number of hits against the reversed
sequence database. SILAC ratios were calculated using only peptides
that could be uniquely mapped to a given protein group, and required
a minimum of two SILAC pairs. To account for any errors in the counting
of the number of cells mixed, the distribution of SILAC ratios
was normalized within MaxQuant at the peptide level so that the median
of log2 ratios is zero, as described by Cox et al.15Prior to statistical analysis, the outputs
from MaxQuant were filtered to remove known contaminants and reverse
sequences, and phosphorylation sites with a MaxQuant localization
probability <0.95 were discarded. This localization probability
cut off was chosen following the manual inspection of the tandem mass
spectra showing the best localization evidence for phosphorylation
sites occurring on protein kinases.Quantitation of the changes
in abundance are derived from the two SILAC labeled experiments with
a 1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown in heavy-SILAC media and bloodstream
cells grown in light-SILAC media, and the label swap experiment with
the SILAC labeling reversed. SILAC ratios for phosphorylation sites
were calculated using only data from the phosphoproteomic experiments,
and SILAC ratios for proteins were calculated using only data from
the nonenriched proteomic experiments. When SILAC ratios were reported
in both label swap experiments, replicate trimming was applied by
calculating the mean and standard deviation Οƒ of the distribution
of the log2 (H/L Γ— L/H), and discarding data >2Οƒ
from the mean (Figure 3).18 Where SILAC ratios were reported in only one experiment,
they were discarded if the percentage variation in the calculated
SILAC ratio (calculated by MaxQuant) was >100%.The Mascot
Delta Score was calculated by determining the difference between the
best and second best Mascot ion scores for alternative phosphorylation
site localizations on an otherwise identical peptide sequence,19 and appended to the MaxQuant outputs. Mascot
distiller was used to peak pick mass spectra and read the centroid
data from raw tandem mass spectra and submit searches to Mascot (Server
version 2.2) using the same sequence database, enzyme specificity,
modifications and mass tolerance as described above.Data was
visualized using Perseus 1.3.0.4 (www.perseus-framework.org) and further information on the identified proteins was obtained
from TriTrypDB (http://www.tritrypdb.org).17 Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment was carried out using
model based gene set analysis or term for term enrichment in Ontologiser20 using a T. brucei specific
GO set containing 16765 terms for 4340 genes obtained from GeneDB
(http://www.genedb.org).21 To
make our data accessible to the scientific community, we uploaded
our study to TriTrypDB and deposited the Thermo RAW files and search
engine output into ProteomeXchange (http://www.proteomexchange.org) accession number PXD000049, enabling researchers to access the
data presented here.

Results
 abeling of loodstream
orm rypanosoma brucei. To enable SILAC
labeling of bloodstream form T. brucei cells, a modified
medium was created based on HMI11-T (HMI9-T lacking serum plus),8 where l-arginine and l-lysine
could be replaced by stable heavy isotope forms (HMI11-SILAC). As
bloodstream form cells are usually only cultured to <2 Γ— 106 cells/ml, a 10-fold lower density than procyclic cells, we
first set out to establish labeling conditions that would reduce the
amount of label required and maximize the number of cells obtained.
We found that the growth of bloodstream form T. brucei cells in HMI11-SILAC containing only 30% of the normal concentration
of l-arginine and l-lysine was equivalent to cell
growth in the HMI9-T medium generally used for bloodstream form cell
culture (Figure 1A). As expected, the HMI11-SILAC
medium failed to support cell growth in the absence of l-arginine
and l-lysine whereas cells were readily able to grow to 5
Γ— 106 cells/ml in the logβ€“linear phase in the
presence of l-arginine and l-lysine (Figure 1B). Furthermore, the gross morphology of the cells
was unaffected after ten days in culture in HMI11-SILAC + 30% l-arginine and l-lysine, as judged by light microscopy
(Figure 1C) and measurement of cell dimensions
by light scattering (Supplemental Table 1, Supporting
Information). Importantly, cells cultured in HMI11-SILAC +
30% l-arginine and l-lysine for >14 days maintained
infectivity in mice (Supplemental Figure 1, Supporting
Information). Taking all the above results into consideration,
we concluded that culture of bloodstream form T. brucei in HMI11-SILAC + 30% l-arginine and l-lysine is
equivalent to culture in HMI9-T media.Figure 1Growth of bloodstream
form T. brucei in SILAC labeling media. Cells were
grown in conventional HMI9-T medium or in the HMI11-SILAC medium developed
in this paper. (A) Cumulative growth over 10 days (with subculturing
every 2β€“3 days). (B) Growth to stationary phase. (C) Light
microscopy of cells after 10 days in culture.To experimentally assess the efficiency of heavy isotope
incorporation in HMI11-SILAC, bloodstream form cells were grown in
HMI11-SILAC + R6K4 for 11β€“12 cell divisions
and extracted proteins subjected to analysis by LCβ€“MS/MS. If
heavy isotope incorporation occurred only by dilution (neglecting
protein turnover), then 11β€“12 cell divisions should produce
>99.9% incorporation, but in reality will be limited by the isotopic
purity of the labeled amino acids. The heavy isotope incorporation
at steady state was estimated to be 98.5 Β± 1.5% by comparing
the relative abundance of the major isotopic peak of the heavy (arginine-13C6/lysine-2H4) and light
forms of ten peptides chosen at random. No significant incorporation
of proline-13C5 (by conversion of arginine-13C6) was observed (Supplemental Figure 2, Supporting Information), as noted previously
for the procyclic form.3Comparative
Proteomic AnalysisA prerequisite for comparative quantitative
phosphoproteomic analyses is access to a relevant comparative quantitative
proteomic data with which to distinguish the different types of quantitative
phosphorylation differences (i.e., those that simply track changes
in protein levels, those that do not correlate with changes in protein
level and those that are unique to one or other lifecycle stage).
Our previous comparative SILAC proteomic analysis of bloodstream grown
in light medium and procyclic form T. brucei grown
in heavy medium gave us ratios for 3553 proteins, and demonstrated
that large changes in specific protein abundance occur between the
lifecycle stages.3 To improve the quality
of this comparative quantitative proteome data set, we exploited the
development of SILAC labeling of bloodstream form trypanosomes, described
above, to perform a β€�label-swapβ€� experiment using a
1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown in light-SILAC medium and bloodstream
form cells grown in heavy-SILAC medium. The combined cells were solubilized
with SDS, and the tryptic peptides generated by FASP were fractionated
by SCX prior to analysis as described previously,3 except that six SCX factions were used and a longer gradient
was applied for the LCβ€“MS/MS analysis instead of running technical
duplicates. A total of 3780 proteins were identified, with SILAC ratios
determined for 3313 of them. The new label-swap data set showed very
good agreement with our published SILAC data,3 with a comparable depth of coverage and a Pearson correlation of
0.92 (Figure 3A). Given the good correlation
between the two data sets, we combined them to provide a definitive
comparative quantitative proteome with which to interpret our phosphoproteomic
data.Comparative Phosphoproteomic StrategyThe objective
of this study was: (i) To define the phosphoproteome of procyclic
form T. brucei for the first time; (ii) To enhance
the existing phosphoproteome of bloodstream form T. brucei.6 (iii) To quantify the changes in phosphorylation
state which occur between the lifecycle stages using SILAC methodology.
Four separate phosphoproteomic experiments were conducted (Figure 2) starting from: (i) Procyclic form cells grown
in light-SILAC medium. (ii) A 1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown
in heavy-SILAC medium and bloodstream form cells grown in light-SILAC
medium. (iii) A β€�label swapβ€� experiment consisting of
a 1:1 mix of bloodstream form cells grown in light-SILAC medium and
procyclic cells grown in heavy-SILAC medium. (iv) Bloodstream form
cells grown in light-SILAC medium. To maximize coverage of membrane
and structural proteins, total protein extracts were prepared with
4% SDS using the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) procedure,11 resulting in near-complete solubilization of
the parasites. After denaturation and reductive alkylation the proteins
were digested with trypsin in solution. Resulting phosphopeptides
were enriched and fractionated into eight samples by SCX chromatography12 prior to further enrichment using TiO2 chromatography in batch mode.13 For each
phosphoproteomic experiment, the eight fractions were analyzed by
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in technical triplicates
on a LTQ Oribtrap Velos using multistage acquisition.14Figure 2Phosphoproteomic workflow. Differentially labeled
(heavy and light) bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes were
lysed in SDS, and total proteins S-alkylated and digested with trypsin
using the FASP method. Phosphopeptides were separated into eight fractions
by SCX HPLC, enriched with TiO2, and analyzed by LCβ€“MS/MS
using MSA.Overview of DataThe combined data were from a total of 138 LCβ€“MS/MS
runs, with 96 runs for samples enriched for phosphopeptides and 88
for samples with SILAC labeling. Altogether 589101 MS/MS spectra
were identified, corresponding to 58087 nonredundant peptide sequences
belonging to 5478 protein groups with a false discovery rate of 1%
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information). A total of 10096 phosphorylation sites were identified on 2551
proteins (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, Supporting
Information), of which SILAC ratios could be determined for
8275 phosphorylation sites on 2233 protein groups, with a Pearson
correlation of 0.78 between the label-swap experiments. A total of
8120 phosphorylation sites on 2137 protein groups were also identified
using Mascot software, of which 6196 phosphorylation sites on 1933
protein groups had a Mascot delta score β‰¥10, reported to give
a 1% false localization rate (FLR) for Orbitrap-MSA data.19 Of the 10096 phosphorylation sites identified
by MaxQuant, 9314 (92%) have not previously been reported. The data
presented here therefore represents a major advance in the depth of
the trypanosome phosphoproteome.Figure 3Correlation of label-swap biological replicates.

Black squares <2 Οƒ, gray square >2 Οƒ.The distribution of phosphorylation between residues
was found to be 8087 phosphoserine (pS) sites (80%), 1,720 phosphothreonine
(pT) sites (17%), and 289 phosphotyrosine (pY) sites (3%), in reasonable
agreement with the T. brucei bloodstream form cytosolic
phosphoproteome observations of 75% pS, 21.5% pT, 3.5% pY.6 Of the 10096 phosphorylation sites observed,
6493 occurred on 1491 proteins annotated as hypothetical or hypothetical
conserved, reflecting the high proportion of genes of unknown function
in the trypanosome genome. Gene Ontology terms are associated with
only 1310 out of the 2552 phosphoproteins we observed, limiting the
power of GO term enrichment analysis. Performing model based gene
set analysis,20 a method designed to give
a high-level summarized view of the data, identified only three terms:
cilliary or flagella motility (GO:001539, PEP 1), protein tyrosine
kinase activity (GO:004713, PEP 0.7), and regulation of gene expression
(GO:0010468, PEP 0.5). This is an intriguing outcome as the T. brucei genome lacks any identifiable dedicated tyrosine
kinases,6,22 yet has the associated GO terms, illustrating
the pitfalls of such analyses. Performing term-for-term enrichment
generated 45 significantly enriched GO terms (p <
0.01, Figure 4) confirming the predominance
of terms associated with flagella motility, protein kinase activity
and regulation of gene expression, and revealing additional terms
for RNA, zinc and calmodulin binding (GO:0005488, GO:0008270, GO:0005516),
and peptidase activity (GO:0004181, GO:0004197). Greater biological
insight from the data is likely to come from the community inspecting
the phosphorylation patterns, and their changes between lifecycle
stages, of proteins of specific interest to them, a few examples of
which are provided below.Figure 4Gene Ontology term enrichment for all observed
phosphoproteins. Term-for-term enrichment, P <

brucei (log2 Pcf/Bsf) to be quantified at both
the protein and phosphorylation site level. As the phosphoproteomic
workflow includes selective enrichment for phosphorylated peptides,
this data cannot be used in the calculation of protein SILAC ratios,
which are instead derived from separate proteomic experiments. We
were able to determine fold-changes for a total of 8275 phosphorylation
sites on 2233 protein groups, with 5768 (70%) of the phosphorylation
sites on 1385 protein groups having ratios at both the protein- and
site-level. In general, the changes in phosphorylation site occupancy
between the lifecycle stages are greater than the changes in protein
levels; for example, 318 (5.5%) of the phosphorylation sites change β‰¥10-fold
(log2 β‰¥|3.32|) between lifecycle stages, while only
33 (0.87%) of protein groups change β‰¥10-fold. Indeed, plotting
the fold-changes in protein ratio against the fold-changes in phosphorylation
site ratio (Figure 5A) reveals that the observed
changes are relatively weakly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.49).
However, there are numerous examples where: (i) The change in phosphorylation
correlates with the change in protein abundance, suggesting that phosphorylation
stoichiometry is maintained between lifecycle stages in these cases.
(ii) The change in phosphorylation correlates negatively with the
change in protein abundance. (iii) Protein abundance is maintained
but phosphorylation stoichiometry changes significantly (both up and
down). (iv) Different phosphorylation sites on the same protein show
a wide range of fold-changes (Figure 5B and
Figure 6). These data demonstrate that changes
in protein phosphorylation status between the lifecycle stages of T. brucei add significant complexity to the differential
expression of the proteome. Some individual cases are discussed in
more detail below.Figure 5Correlation of fold-changes in protein and fold-changes
in phosphorylation sites. (A) Correlation of all phosphorylation sites.
(B) Correlation of average fold-change in phosphorylation sites for
each phosphoprotein, with bars indicating the upper and lower limits
of the range.Manual validation of protein
kinase phosphorylation sitesIn order to judge the quality
of the phosphorylation site assignments, and to empirically assess
the false localization rate, a subset of the automated phosphorylation
site assignments were manually inspected (Figure 6 and Supporting Information). The subset chosen was the T. brucei kinome consisting of 176 protein kinases22b as they are expected to occur at relatively
low abundance and to show physiologically relevant phosphorylation.
Using a MaxQuant localization score of β‰¥0.75 as an initial cutoff,
we identified 641 specific phosphorylation sites on 127 protein kinases
(for comparison a cutoff of β‰¥0.95 gave 493 sites on 124 kinases).
Of these 641 automatically annotated sites on 127 kinases, 549 sites
on 122 kinases were validated by manual inspection (Supplemental Table
S6, Supporting Information). Overall, the
manual validation correlated well with the sites chosen using the
MaxQuant localization score and the Mascot delta score (MDS) methods.19 However, we noted that only 42% of sites in
the MaxQuant localization score range 0.75β€“0.95 were manually
validated, whereas over 94% of the sites MaxQuant localization score
>0.95 were manually validated, increasing to over 98% at a localization
score of >0.99. Further, at an MDS of 10, reported to give a global
1% false localization rate for Orbitrap Velos β€“ MSA data,19 we were able to manually confirm 98% of the
automatically annotated sites. However, it is worth noting that 81%
of sites with MDS < 10 and 66% of sitesidentified by MaxQuant
but not by Mascot were manually validated. Based on this manual survey
of a significant number of phosphorylation site assignments, we have
chosen to report all automatically annotated phosphorylation sites
with MaxQuant localization scores >0.95 (with an estimated false
localization rate of <6%).Figure 6Examples of the assignments of phosphorylation
site location from tandem mass spectral data. (A) STE11 family protein
kinase (Tb11.46.003) with pS357 and pS358 with MaxQuant localization
score of 1.0 and Mascot delta score of 57.8. (B) CAMK family protein
kinase Tb11.01.2290 with pS5 with MaxQuant localization score of 1.0
and Mascot delta score of 27.1, and pS8 with MaxQuant localization
of 1.0 but which was not identified by Mascot. Data acquired on a
LTQ Orbitrap Velos using MSA, * designates loss of phosphate (β�’98
Da), ** loss of two phosphates (β�’196 Da).Interestingly, the variation in the phosphorylation of the
kinome between the two lifecycles stages is lower than the general
data set, with only 15 phosphorylation sites showing a 10-fold or
greater change. The protein kinase A catalytic subunit isoform 1 (Tb09.211.2410)
showed strongly up-regulated phosphorylation in the bloodstream form
parasite at three sites (log2 range β�’5.0 to β�’4.3),
although the assignment of increased phosphorylation in the putative
activation loop at T179 (Log2 β�’2.6) is slightly
ambiguous as an identical (phospho)peptide is shared by protein kinase
A catalytic subunit isoform 2 (Tb09.211.2360). Similarly, the protein
kinase A regulatory subunit (Tb11.02.2210) has 5 sites which are also
up-regulated in the bloodstream form, though to a lesser extent (log2 range β�’4.4 to β�’0.8). Protein kinases with phosphorylation
up-regulated in the procyclic form include a NEK kinase (Tb11.01.6650)
with two sites with a log2 range 5.6 to 4.7, and two CLK
dual specificity kinases Tb927.2.4200 (5 sites, log2 range
3.3 to 0.6) and Tb927.10.15020 (4 sites, log2 range 3.2
to 2.4). Two β€�Otherβ€� group protein kinases have phosphorylation
sites that are up-regulated in the procyclic and bloodstream form,
respectively, (Tb927.7.3210, 5 sites, range log2 β�’3.7
to 2.8; Tb927.7.3220, 5 sites, range log2 β�’3.2 to
1.6).Of the 15 MAPKs present in the T. brucei kinome, 9 (ECK1, KFR1, MOK, RCK, MAPK2, MAPK9, MAPK10, MAPK12, and
an unnamed MAPK) are shown by the data presented here to have dual
phosphorylation in the TxY motif required for activation. In addition,
multiple phosphorylation sites are observed on three potential upstream
STE7 MAP2K and nine STE11 MAP3K protein kinases, suggesting the presence
of active MAPK signaling cascades. The observation of differential
phosphorylation on certain MAPKs, MAP2Ks and MAP3Ks between the two
lifecycle stages suggests that MAPK signaling may play distinct roles
in each lifecycle stage (Figure 7).Figure 7Differential
phosphorylation of MAPK signaling components. Heatmap showing the
change in abundance between the procyclic to bloodstream (Log2) at the protein and phosphorylation site level for the MAPK,
STE7 and STE11 kinase quantified in this study. Red box, TxY motif;
Gray shading, not observed. The Heatmap is generated with GENEE (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/).Phosphorylation Sites Up-regulated
in Bloodstream Form T.bruceiA total of 203 phosphorylation sites on 119 protein groups were
up-regulated β‰¥10-fold (Log2 β‰¤ β�’3.32)
in bloodstream form T. brucei, with a distribution
of these up-regulated phosphorylation sites of 74% pS, 15% pT, 11%
pY, showing a significant enrichment in pY compared to the total observations.
An additional 429 sites with no SILAC ratio (on 319 protein groups)
were observed exclusively in the bloodstream form, with the distribution
of 64% pS, 27.5% pT, 8.5% pY showing a similar trend. These data suggest
that tyrosine phosphorylation is significantly over represented in
sites differentially regulated between the lifecycle stages.In total, 439 proteins have 631 individual phosphorylation sites
that are either β‰¥10-fold up-regulated in the bloodstream form
or are bloodstream form specific (Supplemental Table S7, Supporting Information). This group contains
a large number of proteins annotated as hypothetical or hypothetical
conserved, including 13 of the 15 proteins with >40-fold change
(Log2 < β�’5.32) at the site level. GO term enrichment
of the bloodstream form up-regulated group (of the 191 annotated proteins
out this total 439) produced a very similar set of enriched terms
to the global phosphoproteome (flagella, protein kinase, and gene
expression), with the addition of terms for glycolysis and energy
metabolism, although this may be due, at least in part, to large changes
at the protein level in some of these proteins.3 Nevertheless, researchers interested in the changes in
parasite metabolism between the procyclic and bloodstream form parasites
are likely to find clues to physiologically relevant phosphorylation
changes in the data provided. Significantly, there are examples where
protein up-regulation in bloodstream form parasites may be further
β€�amplifiedβ€� by the coordinate up-regulation of phosphorylation.
Notable examples of this include the RNA recognition motif protein
RBP10 (Tb927.8.2780) that has been reported to promote a bloodstream
form mRNA expression pattern,23 which has
4 phosphorylation sites changing by an average of log2 β�’4.8
(from log2 β�’5.4 to β�’4.2), potentially amplifying
a change in protein abundance of Log2 β�’3.3, and
the receptor-type adenylate cyclase GRESAG4 (Tb927.8.7940) which has
6 phosphorylation sites changing by an average of log2 β�’3.9
(from log2 β�’4.7 to β�’3.1), potentially amplifying
a change in protein abundance of log2 β�’2.4.Phosphorylation
Sites Up-regulated in Procyclic Form T. bruceiA total of 115 phosphorylation sites on 83 protein groups were
β‰¥10-fold up-regulated (log2 β‰¥ 3.32) in procyclic
form T. brucei with a residue distribution of 70%
pS, 22% pT, 9% pY, and an additional 499 sites with no SILAC ratio
on 376 protein groups were observed exclusively in the procyclic form
with a residue distribution of 77% pS, 15.5% pT, 7.5% pY. The significant
enrichment in pY compared to the total observations mirrors that seen
in the bloodstream form up-regulated phosphorylation sites, reinforcing
the importance of changes in the phosphorylation of tyrosine between
the lifecycle stages.In total, 459 proteins have 614 individual
phosphorylation sites that are either β‰¥10-fold up-regulated
in the procyclic form or are procyclic form specific (Supplemental
Table S8, Supporting Information). This
procyclic up-regulated group contains a large number of proteins annotated
as hypothetical or hypothetical conserved, as observed for the bloodstream
form up-regulated group. GO term enrichment of the procyclic up-regulated
group (of 207/460 proteins) again produced a very similar set of enriched
terms to the global and bloodstream form up-regulated phosphoproteome
(flagella, protein kinase, and gene expression) with no significant
new terms. A total of 9 proteins annotated as transporters have >10-fold
change (log2 > 3.32) at the site level, potentially
amplifying the corresponding changes in protein abundance. Interesting
specific examples include: The PAD2 carboxylic acid transporter (Tb927.7.5940),
associated with slender to stumpy bloodstream form transformation
in pleomorphic cell lines,24 where 3 sites
increase in phosphorylation with an average log2 of 3.3
(range log2 1.5 to 6.2) in addition to a protein level
increase of log2 2.9. The ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase
(Tb927.10.2210), which has 10 phosphorylation sites with an average
log2 of 3.6 (range log2 1.6 to 5.6), while the protein has almost no change in level (log2 β�’0.41). The C-14 sterol reductase (Tb11.01.7170),
involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol and its isomers that are
the principal sterols in the procyclic parasites,25 has 2 phosphorylation sites with an average log2 of 3.8 (range log2 3.7 to 3.9),
potentially amplifying the protein fold change of log2 2.2.Phosphoproteins with Differentially Regulated SitesA significant
number of proteins that are multiply phosphorylated exhibit phosphorylation
sites that are differentially regulated within the protein between
the lifecycle stages (Figure 8). There are
234 proteins (Supplementary Table S9, Supporting
Information) where the range of fold-changes of phosphorylation
sites within the protein is greater than 10-fold (range Log2 > |3.32|), with an average of 10 phosphorylation sites per protein.
Interestingly, of the 18 proteins where the change in site occupancy
is greater than 80-fold (range Log2 > |6.32|), 16 are
annotated as hypothetical or hypothetical conserved proteins. GO term
enrichment analysis (of 113/234 proteins) produced significantly enriched
terms (p < 0.01) including flagellum, gene regulation,
and protein phosphatase activity, but that did not include protein
kinase activity. Three protein phosphatases are found in the intraprotein
differentially regulated group: (i) A kinetoplastid-specific protein
phosphatase (Tb11.01.4320) with a differential range log2 of |6.6| (10 sites, range log2 β�’4.8 to 1.8). (ii)
An atypical dual specificity phosphatase (Tb11.01.5870) with a differential
range log2 of |5.6| (3 sites, range log2 β�’3.8
to 1.7). (iii) The TFIIF-Stimulated CTD phosphatase (Tb927.10.11450)
with a differential range log2 of |4.1| (4 sites, range
log2 β�’2.1 to 2.0).Figure 8Distribution of intraprotein differentially
regulated phosphorylation sites. Only proteins with more than one
phosphorylation site are shown.

Discussion
e have previously developed  labeling
in procyclic form . brucei,(3) and here we report the development of  labeling in the clinically
relevant bloodstream form and demonstrate that growth, morphology
and infectivity are unchanged. oth lifecycle stages are rapidly dividing,
enabling efficient isotope incorporation >98%, and show no propensity
to convert arginine to proline. wo recent proteomic analysis using
 labeling in either procyclic26 or
procyclic and bloodstream form27. brucei also observed a similar lack of arginine to proline
conversion.
he quantitation of changes in the global phosphoproteome
between procyclic and bloodstream form lifecycle stages of rypanosoma brucei, described here, reveals that differential
phosphorylation is widespread, is not strongly correlated to change
in protein abundance and adds significant complexity to the differential
expression of the proteome. he observation of intraprotein differential
phosphorylation suggests that phosphorylation may play distinct functional
roles in each lifecycle stage, although how this effect is mediated
is at present unclear and, because of the lack of comparative phosphorylation
data to date, there are few existing hypotheses to examine. owever,
one process where protein phosphorylation is suggested to play a central
role is the differentiation of the parasite from bloodstream to procyclic
form in a coordinated, programmed event.28 hile we have not studied the actual process of differentiation
in this study, we have examined the phosphoproteomes of the initial
and final states of the process, and observe phosphorylation changes
in many of the proteins involved in differentiation. or example,
4 (b927.1.1930)29 has 10 sites with
log2 changes in the range 0.4β€“2.7, 5 (b927.6.4220)30 has a protein change log2 of 0.5
and p. T207 site change log2 of 0.8; ZFK (Tb11.01.1030)31 has a pS520 log2 of β�’1.3;
NOPP44/46 (Tb927.8.760)32 has a protein
log2 of 1.7 and pY5 observed uniquely in procyclic parasites;
PAD2 (Tb927.7.5940)24 has a protein log2 of 2.9 and 3 sites with log2 in the range 1.5
to 6.2. The absence of detected phosphorylation on PIP39 (Tb09.160.4480,
protein log2 of 0.9), and PTP1 (Tb927.10.6690, not observed
in our data set) may be due to up-regulation or transient phosphorylation
during differentiation, such as in the division arrested stumpy form
that was not studied here. Alternatively, the cocktail of phosphatase
inhibitors used in this study may have limited effect against the
activity of one or more trypanosome phosphatase. Clearly, further
detailed studies of the process are required before firm conclusions
can be drawn on the precise rules(s) of protein phosphorylation in
trypanosome differentiation.
In this study we have used culture
adapted Lister 427 bloodstream form (MITat 1.2) and procyclic form
(29.13.6) cell lines that have been made amenable to genetic manipulation
by Wirtz et al. by the insertion of exogenous genes coding for the
T7 RNA polymerase and tetracyclic repressor protein using either one
(bloodstream form) or two (procyclic form) selectable drug resistance
markers.10 The two cell lines used are
independent clones that are not genetically identical, and this may
lead to some differences in protein expression and phosphorylation
status, although such differences are likely to be minor in comparison
to the developmentally regulated changes between the lifecycle stages.
In addition, the culture adapted Lister 427 strains are neither genetically
nor morphologically identical to field isolates, and it is not possible
to account for the impact this will have on protein expression and
phosphorylation status.
A significant proportion of the T. brucei kinome of 176 protein kinases are phosphorylated,
with individual examples of phosphorylation sites up-regulated in
either procyclic or bloodstream form, and examples of intraprotein
differential phosphorylation. The abundance of active MAP kinases,
as judged by the presence of dual TxY motif phosphorylation, suggests
that MAPK pathways are functional in both lifecycle stages of T. brucei, although how or whether the pathways are regulated
remains unclear. Efforts to determine the detailed biological role
of T. brucei protein kinases are ongoing and knock-down
by RNA interference has provided evidence of the essential nature
of a significant number of protein kinases.33 We have recently used chemical proteomic profiling to establish
that T. brucei protein kinases are sensitive to typical
kinase inhibitors with nanomolar potency, demonstrating the potential
for the development of species-specific inhibitors.22b Further analysis of protein kinase mediated phosphorylation
cascades by stimulusβ€“response studies, using the data published
here to anchor them, may reveal the pinch-points that are most suitable
for therapeutic intervention.
Often, eukaryotic phosphorylation
signaling cascades terminate in the modulation of transcription factors
to mediate changes in gene expression. However, classical transcription
factors are missing in T. brucei, where the processing
and stability of polycistronically transcribed mRNA precursors appears
to regulate gene expression.5 One potential
mechanism to modulate gene expression in T. brucei is the use of RNA binding zinc finger proteins to influence mRNA
processing and stability, such as such as ZFP3 (Tb927.3.720)34 and RBP10 (Tb927.8.2780).23 A significant number of ZFPs (31 out of 49) and RBPs (13
out of 47) are present in the phosphoproteomic data reported here,
with a subset of these (11 and 5, respectively) showing lifecycle
specific regulation of phosphorylation status (β‰¥5-fold change).
Since the dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these proteins
has the potential to modulate gene expression, they are reasonable
candidates to be the ultimate effector molecules of at least some
of the trypanosome signaling cascades.
Despite the lack of identifiable
dedicated tyrosine kinases in T. brucei, 234 phosphotyrosine
residues were identified, and tyrosine phosphorylation was 3β€“4
fold over-represented in the phosphorylation sites that change between
the two lifecycle stages. Tyrosine phosphorylation is proposed to
arise from putative dual-specificity protein kinases such as DYRK,
MEK and CLK, but there has been no experimental verification of the
dual specificities of the trypanosome kinases to date.
GO term
enrichment analysis has revealed that the flagellum is consistently
over-represented among the phosphorylated proteins. Flagella can play
both motility and sensory roles, and while it is clear that the trypanosome
flagellum is highly motile, its potential sensory role is less well-defined.35 The dynamic phosphorylation of dynein motors
is proposed to control flagella motility in other organisms, and in
trypanosomes flagella motility is dispensable in the procyclic form
but essential for cytokinesis in the bloodstream form.36 Interestingly, a number of flagella proteins
show extensive intraprotein differential phosphorylation, including:
(i) dynein heavy chain (Tb927.7.920) with 7 sites with log2 changes in the range β�’2.8 to 3.2 and protein log2 changes of β�’0.5; (ii) a paraflagella rod component (Tb927.8.1550)
with 14 sites with log2 changes in the range β�’3.1
to 2.0 and a protein log2 change of β�’0.4; and (iii)
an outer dynein docking complex (Tb11.01.7750) with 3 sites with log2 changes in the range β�’3.6 to 1.8 and a protein log2 change of 0.6.
