X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MTM1) is a severe neonatal disorder often causing perinatal death of the affected males. The responsible gene, designated MTM1, was localized to proximal Xq28 and recently isolated. The characterization of MTM1 allowed us to screen for causing mutations in three families, previously investigated by linkage analysis. Using exon amplification, single strand conformation polymorphism, and subsequent sequencing analysis, three new mutations and their mutational origin were characterized by analyzing 10 exons. An acceptor splice site and a frameshift mutation were correlated with the concurrent appearance of XLMTM in two families. A third intronic mutation was also analyzed by reverse transcription PCR and revealed a cryptic splice site mutation cosegregating with the presumed XLMTM haplotype in the third family. These results further support the implication of the MTM1 gene in XLMTM and allow efficient and reliable carrier and prenatal diagnosis in these families. Direct mutational diagnosis of families at risk in combination with haplotype analysis avoid the drawbacks using only linkage analysis, make genetic counselling far more reliable, and early clinical management of this disease more appropriate. Moreover, pedigree analyses provide first information on de novo mutation frequency in this newly identified human disease gene.
