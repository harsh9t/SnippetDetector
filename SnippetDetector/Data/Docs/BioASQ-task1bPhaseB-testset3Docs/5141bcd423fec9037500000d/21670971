This study evaluated the relevance of CXCR2 chemokine receptors in oral squamous cell carcinoma, by means of in vitro and in vivo approaches. The in vitro incubation of the selective and non-peptide CXCR2 receptor antagonist N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N9-(2-bromophenyl) Urea (SB225002; 25 to 800 nM) produced a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of SCC158 (rat) and HN30 (human) cell lines viability. Conversely, this antagonist did not significantly affect the viability of the immortalized keratinocyte lineage, HaCaT. Additionally, the incubation of human IL-8 and rat CINC-1 CXCR2 agonists produced a concentration-related increase on HN30 and SCC158 proliferation. The submucosal injection of SCC158 cells (5 Ã— 10(6) cells) into the tongue of Fischer 344 rats induced tumor development, which displayed typical clinical features. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat tongue biopsies revealed a marked increase of CXCR2 receptor immunoreactivity, which was accompanied by augumented expression of VEGF and caspase-3. Our data suggests an important role for CXCR2 receptors in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
