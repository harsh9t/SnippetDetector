BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The identification of the different subtypes of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may provide a rational basis for the choice of the appropriate medical treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate differential diagnosis and treatment regimens of AIT in children and adolescent. PATIENTS: We reported 3 patients: A 6.7 years old boy with type I AIT; a 17.9 years old girl with type II AIT and a 14.6 years old girl with mixed type AIT. CONCLUSIONS: AIT is not an uncommon complication in countries with low iodine intake. AIT can be asymptomatic and can occur at any time in patients receiving amiodarone therapy. It is also very important to distinguish the type of AIT when planning therapy. Steroid therapy should be started when findings indicate type II or mixed-type AIT. Beta blockers may prevent heart thyrotoxicosis and recurrence of primary arrhythmia if amiodarone is discontinued.
