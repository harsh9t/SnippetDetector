<abstract>
Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction has been reported to affect 2-24% of users. Despite the easy management of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, the development of thyrotoxicosis leads to a difficult approach in most cases. The aim of this study is to describe three different cases of patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and discuss the clinical and laboratorial aspects, and the different approaches to them. It is essential to carefully evaluate patients before and during amiodarone therapy, since the prompt diagnosis and treatment of this condition is essential in patients with high cardiovascular risk.
