OBJECTIVE: To report on adverse reactions associated with amiodarone and propylthiouracil. CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and nodular goiter progressed to overt thyrotoxicosis after receiving therapy with amiodarone 200 mg/day for less than 12 weeks. Thyroid scan revealed a hyperfunctioning nodule in the left lobe, while immunologic studies were negative for both thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody level was transiently elevated. Propylthiouracil 100 mg 3 times/day was started after the withdrawal of amiodarone, but the patient developed severe generalized skin rash, fever, and leukocytosis after 4 weeks. Thyroidectomy was performed, and histopathology was compatible with type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) associated with toxic nodular goiter. An objective causality assessment revealed that thyrotoxicosis was probably related to use of amiodarone. DISCUSSION: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that may cause thyroid dysfunction. Differentiating between the 2 types of AIT is important for implementation of the correct therapeutic strategy. The transient elevation of TSH receptor antibodies in AIT complicated the diagnosis. As a rare subtype, type 1 AIT by nodular goiter may be associated with early AIT. Initiating thyroid function monitoring within 3 months of amiodarone therapy should be considered. CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 AIT caused by nodular goiter is rarely reported. Amiodarone should be avoided in such patients and subtotal thyroidectomy to remove the toxic nodule may be the treatment of choice.
