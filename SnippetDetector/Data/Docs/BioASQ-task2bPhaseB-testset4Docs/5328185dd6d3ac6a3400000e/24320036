Resistin is an adipocyte- and monocyte-derived cytokine which has been implicated in the modulation of insulin action, energy, glucose and lipid homeostasis. Resistin has been associated with insulin resistance and many of its known complications. As a molecular link between metabolic signals, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction, resistin can be proposed as playing a significant role in the heightened inflammatory state induced by metabolic stress linked to excessive caloric intake, thus contributing to the risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this review, we highlighted the role of resistin, as an inflammatory cytokine, in the development of CVD, T2DM and the MetS.
