UNLABELLED: Cardiometabolic disorders have been associated with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), while the relationship of cardiovascular risk score (CRS) and metabolic syndrome (MS) with different clinical presentation of PHPT remains undefined. Our aim was to evaluate CRS, MS and its components in PHPT looking for their correlation to different clinical forms. In 68 consecutive PHPT patients and 68 matched controls, CRS, MS and its components were assessed to perform an observational case-control study at an ambulatory referral center for Bone Metabolism Diseases. Patients were stratified in symptomatic and asymptomatic PHPT; these latter were divided in high-risk and low-risk subgroups for end-organ damage. An increased proportion of PHPT patients had intermediate-high CRS and MS (mean, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 51.5 %, 39.6-63.3 and 20.6 %, 11.0-30.2, respectively, p < 0.02 vs. controls). Intermediate-high CRS was prevalent both in symptomatic and low-risk asymptomatic PHPT while MS resulted prevalent in low-risk asymptomatic but not in symptomatic PHPT. Type 2 DM, IFG, mixed dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL-hypocholesterolemia, and LDL-hypercholesterolemia predominated in low-risk asymptomatic, while only LDL-hypercholesterolemia prevailed also in symptomatic PHPT. In patients and controls without cardiometabolic risk factors, HOMA-IR index was significantly increased in PHPT vs. controls (p < 0.03) and associated to total calcium (R = 0.73; p < 0.001). By multivariate analysis low-risk asymptomatic PHPT predicted MS after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Our data show an increased frequency of intermediate-high CRS both in symptomatic and low-risk asymptomatic PHPT while MS prevails in low-risk asymptomatic PHPT, supporting the potential for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality also in this form.
