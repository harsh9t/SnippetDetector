Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), one of the most prevalent arboviruses in Europe and in many parts of Asia. Transmission of TBEV to humans usually occurs by bite of an infected tick or rarely by ingestion of unpasteurized milk products of infected livestock. TBEV infection induces an innate and adaptive immune response, nevertheless it is able to replicate in several cell types of the immune system at the same time which probably contributes to the spread of the virus in the human host. Furthermore, TBEV can enter the central nervous system (CNS) by yet not well understood mechanisms via the blood brain barrier (BBB) or the olfactory neurons which leads toÂ serious neurological disorders like meningitis, encephalitis or even meningoencephalitis. In this article we review the known facts and possible hypotheses of interaction of TBEV with components of the mammalian immune system and their implications for TBEV-mediated pathogenesis.
