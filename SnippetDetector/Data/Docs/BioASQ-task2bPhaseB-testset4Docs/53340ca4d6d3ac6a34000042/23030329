Early diagnosis of dengue, the most common mosquito-borne disease globally, remains challenging. Dengue presents initially as undifferentiated fever, with symptoms becoming more pathognomonic in the later stages of illness. This limits the timeliness in the delivery of appropriate supportive interventions. Laboratory tests are useful for diagnosis although the short-lived viremia and the presence of secondary infection with one of the four heterologous viral serotypes collectively complicate the choice and interpretation of laboratory tests. In this article, the authors review the various approaches for diagnosis of dengue and discuss the appropriate tests to use, including when a dengue vaccine, which is in the late stages of development, is licensed for use. The ensuing reduced dengue prevalence could make diagnosis for vaccine efficacy and escape-mutant monitoring even more challenging.
