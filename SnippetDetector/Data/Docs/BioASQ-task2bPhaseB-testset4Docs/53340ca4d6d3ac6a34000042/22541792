Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted infection that poses significant global health risks for travelers and individuals living in the tropics and subtropics. The reported global incidence has increased dramatically in the past century, with dengue now ranking as the most common cause of febrile illness in travelers. While sporadic cases have been reported within the southern United States since 1980, autochthonous outbreaks have now been described in Hawaii, St. Croix (US Virgin Islands), along the Texas-Mexico border, and, most recently, in Key West, Florida. Although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, 5-10% of patients may experience hemorrhagic disease, with shock and even death. Laboratory identification commonly involves serologic and nucleic acid amplification methods. Due to rising incidence worldwide, physicians should be familiar with the clinical manifestations, laboratory diagnosis, and management of this illness.
