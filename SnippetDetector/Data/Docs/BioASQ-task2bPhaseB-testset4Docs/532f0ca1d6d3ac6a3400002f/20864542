Alterations in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) are believed to play a central role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Burgeoning data indicate that APP is proteolytically processed in endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal compartments. In this study, we used both in vivo and in vitro paradigms to determine whether alterations in macroautophagy affect APP metabolism. Three mouse models of glycosphingolipid storage diseases, namely Niemann-Pick type C1, GM1 gangliosidosis, and Sandhoff disease, had mTOR-independent increases in the autophagic vacuole (AV)-associated protein, LC3-II, indicative of impaired lysosomal flux. APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) were also increased in brains of the three mouse models; however, discrepancies between LC3-II and APP-CTFs were seen between primary (GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) and secondary (Niemann-Pick type C1) lysosomal storage models. APP-CTFs were proportionately higher than LC3-II in cerebellar regions of GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease, although LC3-II increased before APP-CTFs in brains of NPC1 mice. Endogenous murine Aβ40 from RIPA-soluble extracts was increased in brains of all three mice. The in vivo relationship between AV and APP-CTF accumulation was also seen in cultured neurons treated with agents that impair primary (chloroquine and leupeptin + pepstatin) and secondary (U18666A and vinblastine) lysosomal flux. However, Aβ secretion was unaffected by agents that induced autophagy (rapamycin) or impaired AV clearance, and LC3-II-positive AVs predominantly co-localized with degradative LAMP-1-positive lysosomes. These data suggest that neuronal macroautophagy does not directly regulate APP metabolism but highlights the important anti-amyloidogenic role of lysosomal proteolysis in post-secretase APP-CTF catabolism.

Introduction
eurodegenerative proteinopathies such as lzheimer disease (),4 arkinson disease, and untington disease are
                defined by progressive accumulation of protein aggregates. n , aggregation of the
                amyloid-² (²) protein and au is believed to play a central role in
                 pathogenesis (1, 2).  role for endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal () dysfunction
                in  is supported by the presence of enlarged endosomes and increased amounts of
                lysosomal proteases in  and own syndrome brain (3, 4). acroautophagy (hereafter
                referred to as autophagy) is a constitutively active branch of the wider  system,
                involved in the sequestration of cytosolic regions into characteristic
                double-membrane or multimembrane autophagosomes that are delivered to lysosomes for
                degradation (5, 6). he term β€�autophagic vacuoleβ€� () is used to describe
                a spectrum of autophagic structures that include nascent autophagosomes and
                post-fusion autophagic organelles such as amphisomes (autophagosomes fused with
                endosomes) and autolysosomes (autophagosomes fused with lysosomes). s are
                identifiable by the protein, 3- (phospho-lipidated form of
                microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-, 1 3-), which is associated
                with both luminal and cytosolic surfaces of  membranes (7). lassical autophagy activation is regulated through
                3/kt/m. TOR pathways, although alternative mTOR-independent pathways also exist
                    (5, 8). In neurons, lysosomal processing is highly efficient, and under
                basal conditions the amounts of AVs are low (9β€“11). However, in the AD brain, AVs accumulate in degenerating
                neurons and resemble those seen when AV processing is impaired (9, 12).
Several rare hereditary lysosomal storage diseases also exhibit autophagic
                dysfunction with pathological changes reminiscent of features seen in AD, such as
                dystrophic axons, ectopic dendrites, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid
                aggregation (13β€“16).
                Glycosphingolipidoses are a subset of lysosomal storage diseases characterized by an
                accumulation of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a class of lipids containing at least one
                monosaccharide linked to a ceramide backbone. GSLs are particularly prevalent in
                neurons and are required for effective lipid raft functioning (17, 18). Altered
                neurodevelopment and progressive neurodegeneration are common among GSL storage
                diseases (19, 20). GM1 gangliosidosis and the GM2 gangliosidosis, Sandhoff disease,
                are primary GSL storage diseases caused by an absence of active lysosomal enzymes,
                acid Ξ²-galactosidase and Ξ²-hexosaminidase (21, 22), respectively.
                Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a secondary lysosomal storage disease, caused
                by defects in the transmembrane NPC1 protein of late endosomes/lysosomes. Its
                function remains controversial (23), but
                mutations cause impaired fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, leading to the
                storage of multiple lipids, including GSLs (24β€“26). Mouse models of lysosomal storage disorders recapitulate
                many facets of the human diseases and provide useful in vivo models
                for studying EAL dysfunction.
In this study, we investigated the effects of perturbing two separate components of
                lysosomal flux (27), namely substrate
                degradation within lysosomes (primary lysosomal flux) and substrate delivery to
                lysosomes (secondary lysosomal flux) on autophagy and APP metabolism. This was done
                using mouse models of NPC1, GM1 gangliosidosis, and Sandhoff diseases.
                mTOR-independent AV accumulation and increased APP-C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs)
                were detected in all three mouse models. However, APP-CTF increases were
                disproportionately higher than AV accumulation in primary storage (GM1
                gangliosidosis and Sandhoff) brains, whereas AV accumulation preceded APP-CTF
                accumulation in secondary storage (NPC1) brains. Total AΞ²40 was increased in
                both NPC1 and GM1 gangliosidosis brains but not Sandhoff brains; however,
                lipid-associated AΞ²40 was increased in all three mouse brains. In cultured
                neurons, impairments of both primary and secondary lysosomal flux produced similar
                patterns of AV and APP-CTFs as those seen in mouse models of GSL storage diseases.
                Interestingly, neither autophagy activation nor impairment of autophagic flux
                affected the secretion of endogenous murine AΞ². Also, rapamycin-induced
                generation of nascent autophagosomes did not alter levels of APP or APP-CTFs,
                suggesting that APP is not directly metabolized in the autophagic pathway.
                Consistent with the idea that neuronal autophagy is highly efficient,
                LC3-II-positive AVs predominantly localized to lysosomes and not early or late
                endosomes. Although these findings indicate that macroautophagy does not play a
                direct role in the metabolism of APP, it highlights the requirement of efficient
                lysosomal function in preventing the accumulation of AVs and amyloidogenic APP
                metabolites.

                            neuropathological features of the human diseases were used in this
                            study. Niemann-Pick type C1 mice (hereafter referred to as NPC1 mice)
                            were from an established colony of npc1NIH spontaneous mutant
                            mice on a BALB/cJ background that do not translate mRNA for NPC1 into
                            protein (28). GM1 gangliosidosis
                            mice (hereafter referred to as GM1 mice) were from an established colony
                            of Ξ²-galactosidase (β�’/β�’) mice on a C57BL/6J
                            background (29) generously
                            provided by Dr. Sandra d'Azzo (St. Jude Children's Research
                            Hospital, Memphis, TN). Sandhoff disease mice were from an established
                            colony of Ξ²-hexosaminidase (β�’/β�’) mice also on a
                            C57BL/6J background (30) and were
                            generously provided by Dr. Rick Proia (National Institutes of Health).
                            Genotypes for each mouse strain were confirmed by PCR as described
                            previously (28β€“30). Genotypes for NPC1 mice were also confirmed by
                            Western blot. Humane end points were applied in agreement with the
                            United Kingdom Home Office (9β€“12 weeks for NPC1 mice, 7β€“9
                            months for GM1 mice, and 14β€“16 weeks for Sandhoff mice). Animals
                            were housed in a 12 h light/dark cycle, with food and water provided
                                ad libitum. All animals were euthanized by
                                CO2 inhalation using protocols approved by the United
                            Kingdom Home Office (Animal Scientific Procedures Act, 1986). Brains
                            were rapidly removed, and cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar regions
                            were isolated, flash-frozen on dry ice, and stored at β�’80
                            Β°C pending biochemical analysis. Age-matched wild type
                            littermates were used as controls for each mouse strain.Preparation of Regional Brain Extracts for Immunoblot
                            AnalysisFrozen brain regions were weighed frozen and homogenized in 10 volumes of
                            RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl,
                            0.5% IGEPAL-CA630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
                            SDS) containing protease inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 1 mm
                            EGTA, 5 ΞΌg/ml leupeptin, 5 ΞΌg/ml aprotinin, 2 ΞΌg/ml
                            pepstatin, 120 ΞΌg/ml Pefabloc, 2 mm
                            1,10-phenanthroline), using 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer connected
                            to an overhead stirrer (Wheaton, NJ) set to speed 4. The resulting
                            suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 Γ— g at
                            4 Β°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Total protein
                            content of samples was estimated using a bicinchoninic acid protein
                            assay kit (Pierce) and equalized to 1 mg/ml using RIPA buffer. Samples
                            were frozen as 1 ml aliquots at β�’80 Β°C or boiled for 3 min
                            at 100 Β°C in 4Γ— Tris-Tricine sample buffer (1Γ—
                            concentration: 750 mm Tris base, pH 8.45, 10% glycerol,
                            4% SDS, 0.01% phenol red) and subsequently used for
                            Western immunoblot. Optimal LC3-II measurement was achieved using
                            freshly homogenized tissue that was consecutively processed for Western
                            immunoblotting without freezing; therefore, all tissue was analyzed for
                            LC3-II before other proteins.Culturing, Treatment, and Harvesting of Primary Cortical
                            NeuronsRat primary cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (9). Briefly, brain cells were
                            isolated from the neocortex of embryonic day 18 (E18) Wistar rat embryos
                            and plated at a density of 100,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well dishes
                            pre-coated with poly-d-lysine (50 ΞΌg/ml; Sigma) and
                            incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
                            CO2, 95% atmosphere at 37 Β°C. One-half of the
                            plating medium was replaced with fresh penicillin/streptomycin-free
                            medium every 3 days until cultures reached 14 days in
                                vitro (DIV14). Neurons were treated at DIV14 with U18666A
                            (2 ΞΌg/ml), vinblastine (10 ΞΌm), chloroquine (10
                                ΞΌm), leupeptin (20 ΞΌm), pepstatin
                            (20 ΞΌm), or rapamycin (0.1 ΞΌm).
                            Treatments were synchronized so that cultures could be harvested at the
                            same time, i.e. the 48 h interval was initiated first
                            and 1 h interval last. Culture media were removed, and cells were washed
                            once in ambient phosphate-buffered saline solution (1 ml/well) and then
                            lysed and scraped into ice-cold RIPA buffer. Thereafter, neuronal
                            lysates were processed in the same manner as outlined for brain tissue
                            extracts.Preparation of Mouse Brain Extracts and Conditioned Media from
                            Primary Neurons for AΞ² ELISABrain extracts were prepared for AΞ² ELISA in accordance with
                            protocols described previously (31β€“33), with some modifications. Whole
                            mouse brain without the brainstem was Dounce-homogenized (10 strokes) at
                            40% w/v (wet weight) in Tissue Homogenization Buffer (THB, 250
                                mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris base) containing protease
                            inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 ΞΌg/ml
                            leupeptin, 5 ΞΌg/ml aprotinin, 2 ΞΌg/ml pepstatin, 120
                            ΞΌg/ml Pefabloc, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline). Homogenates
                            were then diluted 1:1 in diethylamine (DEA) buffer (0.4%
                            diethylamine, 100 mm NaCl) and re-homogenized (6 strokes), and
                            1 ml aliquots were centrifuged at 100,000 Γ— g at
                            4 Β°C for 1 h. DEA-containing supernatants were removed and
                            neutralized by addition of 1/10th volume of Tris base (0.5 m,
                            pH 6.8) to 1 volume of DEA supernatant and stored at β�’80
                            Β°C pending analysis. Pellets were solubilized by probe sonication
                            (23 kHz, 10 ΞΌm amplitude, 5 s) using a Soniprep 150 (MSE
                            Instruments, Sussex, UK) in RIPA buffer (40% w/v of initial wet
                            weight) with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 10,000 Γ—
                                g at 4 Β°C for 10 min. The supernatant,
                            referred to as the RIPA extract, was aliquoted and stored at β�’80
                            Β°C until needed.In primary cortical neurons, the effect of pharmacological agents on
                            AΞ² production and secretion was assessed by fully replacing
                            existing culture media with fresh media (1.5 ml/well of a 6-well dish)
                            containing the appropriate drug and incubated for 24 h. Thereafter, the
                            entire conditioned media from each 6-well dish was collected in 15-ml
                            tubes and centrifuged at 200 Γ— g at 4 Β°C
                            for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Conditioned media were then
                            concentrated β�Ό9-fold to 1 ml using YM-3 centrifugal filter
                            devices (Millipore, MA).Murine AΞ² Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)AΞ² from mouse brain extracts and conditioned media was measured
                            using ELISA methods described previously (33, 34),
                            with some modifications. Stock solutions of 1 mg/ml murine
                            AΞ²(1β€“40) and AΞ²(1β€“42) peptides (American
                            Peptide Company, Inc., Sunnydale, CA) were made up in 0.1%
                                NH4OH. Thereafter, working stock solutions of 5 pmol/ml
                            were prepared by diluting stock solutions of AΞ² in ELISA Capture

                            was used to develop ELISAs, and colorimetric development was stopped by
                            adding 100 ΞΌl/well of o-phosphoric acid
                            (5.7%). Absorbance for plates were read at 450 nm using a Spectra

                            room temperature, fixed in ice-cold methanol (β�’20 Β°C) for
                            5 min, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Blocking Buffer
                            (1% BSA, 2% normal goat serum (Dako, CA), 0.05%
                                NaN3). Neurons were incubated with primary antibodies (5

                            (EEA1, NPC1, CI-MPR, and LAMP-1) at room temperature. Cells were washed
                            (three times) in PBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies
                            (1:1000 in Blocking Buffer, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse, and Alexa

                            visualize nuclei, cells were washed (three times) in PBS and stained
                            with Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen, 1:10,000 in PBS) for 3 min. Coverslips
                            were mounted onto microscope slides with antifade Gelmount (Biomeda, CA)
                            and cells visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.Lactate Dehydrogenase Sequestration AssayThe autophagic sequestration of lactate dehydrogenase in primary cortical
                            neurons was determined using a method previously described by Kopitz
                                et al. (35),
                            with minor modifications. Neurons were harvested in ice-cold Sucrose
                            Buffer (PBS, 10% sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20,

                            Pefabloc, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, pH 7.4). The volume of
                            Sucrose Buffer used was 0.25 ml per well of a 6-well dish. Three wells
                            were pooled for each experimental point, and cell suspensions were
                            probe-sonicated (23 kHz, 5 ΞΌm amplitude, 5 s) using a Soniprep
                            150 (MSE Instruments, Sussex, UK). This suspension was then layered onto
                            3 ml of an 8% (w/v) Histodenz/Sucrose Buffer and centrifuged at
                            7,000 Γ— g at 4 Β°C for 30 min. After
                            centrifugation, the top 1 ml of each sample was collected and designated
                            as the cytosolic LDH fraction. The resulting pellets were washed twice
                            by resuspending and centrifuging (10,000 Γ— g for
                            5 min) in Sucrose Buffer. Pellets were then resuspended in Sucrose
                            Buffer containing 0.5 ΞΌg/ml digitonin, using a hand held
                            biovortexer (BioSpec Products, OK), and incubated for 15 min at 37
                            Β°C to permeabilize AVs and release sequestered LDH. Samples were
                            then centrifuged at 10,000 Γ— g at 4 Β°C
                            for 5 min, and the supernatant was referred to as the sequestered LDH
                            fraction. LDH activity was determined using a formazan-producing assay
                            kit from Innoprot (Derio, Spain).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot AnalysesProteins from brain tissue and primary neuron lysates were analyzed using
                            Tris-glycine and Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE systems. 7% polyacrylamide
                            Tris-glycine gels were used for NPC1 protein, full-length APP (Fl-APP),
                            phospho- and total p70S6 kinase. 14% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine
                            gels were used for LC3-II detection, and 16% polyacrylamide
                            Tris-Tricine gels were used for the detection of APP-CTFs. Tris-glycine
                            gel solutions were made from a 30% T (total w/v %),
                            2.6% C (cross-linker w/v %) acrylamide/bisacrylamide stock
                            solution (National Diagnostics, GA) and run on a triple-wide gel system
                            (C.B.S. Scientific, CA) that allowed for running 31 samples at a time,
                            which made inter-regional comparisons between wild type and NPC1 mice
                            possible. Tris-Tricine gels were made from a 49.5% T, 5% C
                            stock (separating gel) and a 49.5% T, 3.3% C (stacking
                            gel) and run on a vertical electrophoresis unit (width Γ— height,
                            16.5 Γ— 14.5 cm; Sigma). Samples containing 50 ΞΌg of
                            protein were loaded onto gels and run at 150 V. Proteins were
                            transferred onto Optitran reinforced nitrocellulose membrane (0.2
                            ΞΌm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell) at 400 mA for 2 h at 4
                            Β°C. Uniform transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose was
                            confirmed by reversible staining with Ponceau S (0.1% w/v,
                            1% acetic acid, Sigma). Membranes were then blocked for 1 h at
                            room temperature in 5% skimmed milk/TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline
                            solution containing 0.1% Tween 20), then washed (three times for
                            5 min) in TBS-T, and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in a
                            1% BSA/TBS-T solution for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at
                            4 Β°C. Membranes were washed (three times for 5 min) in TBS-T
                            before horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (sheep
                            anti-mouse HRP (Amersham Biosciences) and donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham
                            Biosciences) made in 2.5% milk/TBS-T) were added for 1 h at room
                            temperature. Membranes were washed (three times for 20 min) in TBS-T,
                            and the proteins of interest were visualized using chemiluminescent
                            substrates (Pierce). Fuji Super RX film (FujiFilm, Dusseldorf, Germany)
                            band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.43q)
                            from the National Institutes of Health.Data AnalysisStatistical significance for percentage comparisons was determined using
                            a Wilcoxon-signed rank test with a theoretical mean of 100%. An
                            unpaired Student's t test was used for experiments
                            where quantitative values were obtained. Prism software (version 4.0c)
                            was used for all statistical analyses, where a p value
                            < 0.05 was deemed significant. Statistical significance is annotated
                            in figures accordingly: *, p < 0.05;
                            **, p < 0.01;

                            iseases. The progressive neurodegeneration that occurs in NPC1 affects specific
                            brain regions differentially. The cerebellum is known to undergo the
                            earliest and most severe degeneration, but cortical and hippocampal
                            regions are also affected (36,
                                37). To confirm that
                            dysfunctional autophagy is present in brains of mice lacking NPC1
                            protein (38β€“40),
                            we measured levels of LC3-II, a marker of both nascent and undegraded
                            AVs. This approach aimed to determine when and in which brain regions
                            the dysfunctional autophagy develops in the NPC1 mouse. As expected
                                (41), basal levels of LC3-II
                            were consistently low in all regions of wild type mouse brain (Fig. 1A). In
                            contrast, a sustained increase in LC3-II was evident in the cortex and
                            hippocampus of NPC1 mice at 3 weeks and in the cerebellum at 6 weeks.
                            LC3-II amounts were highest at end stage in the cortex (273 Β±
                            30%), hippocampus (349 Β± 77%), and cerebellum (239
                            Β± 39%), indicating progressive AV accumulation (Fig. 1, A and
                                B). These results highlight the early involvement
                            and widespread nature of dysfunctional autophagy in the NPC1 brain.FIGURE 1.Progressive LC3-II accumulation in NPC1 mouse
                                        brains.

                                    LC3-I/II, p-p70, and total p70 expression in cortical
                                        (Ctx, panel i),
                                    hippocampal (Hip., panel ii),
                                    and cerebellar (Cbm., panel
                                        iii) regions of wild type and NPC1 brains at 3 and
                                    6 weeks and end stage (9β€“12 weeks). B,
                                    histogram of LC3-II expression in NPC1 brain regions relative to
                                    3-week NPC1 cerebellar levels (n = 5,
                                    mean Β± S.E.). Note: comparisons with corresponding wild
                                    type mice was not possible due to undetectable basal levels of
                                    LC3-II in healthy mice. Considering 3-week NPC1 regions had the
                                    lowest expression of LC3-II among the NPC1 mice, their levels
                                    were used as a base line for comparing LC3-II changes in other
                                    NPC1 brain regions. C, histogram of
                                    phospho-p70/total p70 expression in NPC1 brain relative to
                                    corresponding brain regions in age-matched wild type controls
                                        (n = 6, mean Β± S.E.).AVs can accumulate in neurons due to increased autophagosome production
                            or impaired processing by lysosomes (9). To determine whether AV accumulation in the NPC1 mouse
                            brain is caused by an mTOR-mediated induction of autophagy, mTOR
                            activity was assessed by measuring the extent of mTOR-specific
                            phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase (Fig.
                                1, A and C). We found no
                            change in the ratio of phospho-/total p70S6 kinase in any of the regions
                            or time points studied. At end stage, the total level of p70S6 kinase in
                            all NPC1 brain regions was decreased relative to age-matched wild type
                            control mice, but the phospho-p70/total p70 ratio was unaffected. These
                            results indicate that the increased expression of LC3-II seen in the
                            NPC1 mouse brain does not require an mTOR-mediated induction of
                            autophagy but may arise from an impaired clearance of constitutively
                            produced autophagosomes by lysosomes (autophagic flux).The classification of GSL storage disorders depends on whether gene
                            defects affect GSL metabolism directly (primary storage disease) or
                            indirectly (secondary storage disease). Considering the nonenzymatic
                            nature of NPC1 protein, which facilitates fusion between late endosomes
                            and lysosomes, NPC1 is classed as a secondary GSL storage disease. On
                            the other hand, GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease are considered
                            primary GSL storage diseases because they are caused by an absence of
                            functional lysosomal enzymes, acid Ξ²-galactosidase and
                            Ξ²-hexosaminidase, respectively (21, 22). Thus, having
                            characterized the development of autophagic dysfunction in a mouse model
                            of secondary GSL storage, we were interested to know if impaired
                            autophagic flux also occurred in mouse models of primary GSL storage
                            diseases. Again, this was assessed by measuring both LC3-II expression
                            and mTOR activity. Similar to the situation in NPC1 mouse brain, LC3-II
                            expression was increased in an mTOR-independent manner in brains from
                            both GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff brains (Fig. 2, Aβ€“D). However,
                            unlike NPC1 mice, which had similarly high levels of LC3-II expression
                            in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, LC3-II expression in both
                            GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff mice was higher in the cortex and
                            hippocampus than the cerebellum. As with NPC1 mice, the ratio of
                            phospho-/total p70S6 kinase was unaltered in both GM1 gangliosidosis and
                            Sandhoff brains (Fig.
                                2D), suggesting that the evident autophagic
                            dysfunction was not mediated by mTOR. Inter-regional LC3-II differences
                            in NPC1, GM1, and Sandhoff mice highlights the fact that although
                            autophagic dysfunction is present in these mouse models, certain brain
                            regions are affected differentially depending on whether the mutant mice
                            have a primary or secondary GSL storage defect. It is also of note that
                            inter-regional differences in LC3-I expression was a general feature
                            seen in the mouse brain, with higher expression found in the hippocampus
                            and cortex compared with cerebellum. This may be due to the proportional
                            expression of LC3-I in cell types of these regions.FIGURE 2.LC3-II is increased in GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff

                                    Β± S.E.).Although the underlying cause of dysfunctional autophagy in mouse models
                            of NPC1, GM1, and Sandhoff disease is likely to stem from impaired
                            processing of constitutively produced AVs (autophagic flux), it is
                            possible that different types of AVs accumulate in each disease
                            depending on direct (autophagosome-lysosome) or indirect
                            (autophagosome-endosome-lysosome) routes affected in each. We therefore
                            sought to utilize these differences to determine whether autophagy plays
                            a direct or indirect role in the metabolism of APP.APP-CTFs Levels Do Not Always Correlate with LC3-II in Mouse Models
                            of GSL Storage DiseasesGiven the believed importance of APP in AD pathogenesis and the
                            identification of autophagic compartments as important sites for APP
                            metabolism (42, 43), we sought to determine whether
                            autophagic dysfunction in mouse models of GSL storage diseases coincided
                            with altered APP metabolism. We therefore measured amounts of APP
                            holoprotein and its C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) in brain extracts
                            from age-matched wild type controls and the three GSL storage disease
                            mouse models. Using Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and a C-terminal-specific
                            antibody (C1/6.1) that recognizes the last 20 amino acids of APP, at
                            least five CTFs were consistently detected in wild type brain (Fig. 3, Aβ€“C).
                            The estimated molecular weights of the APP-CTF species detected were as
                            follows: 13.2 kDa (CTF-1); 12.5 kDa (CTF-2); 12 kDa (CTF-3); 11.6 kDa
                            (CTF-4); and 11.1 kDa (CTF-5). Because these species all have a common C
                            terminus, the observed molecular weight differences likely result due to
                            variations in the N terminus and/or phosphorylation state (44β€“46). For the
                            purpose of this study, we chose to focus on total APP-CTF levels and
                            normalized these relative to Fl-APP. Relative to wild type mice,
                            6-week-old NPC1 mice had higher levels of APP-CTFs in cortical and
                            hippocampal regions, but in end stage NPC1 brain, the relative amounts
                            of APP-CTFs were dramatically increased in both cortex (220 Β±
                            54%) and hippocampus (190 Β± 31%; Fig. 3D).
                            Accumulation of APP-CTFs occurred earlier in the NPC1 cerebellum, being
                            2-fold higher at 6 weeks (250 Β± 25%) and almost 5-fold
                            higher (489 Β± 124%) at end stage. Thus APP-CTFs
                            accumulated earlier and to a greater extent in cerebellum than in either
                            the cortex or hippocampus. Interestingly, at least two additional
                            APP-CTFs, CTF-6 (10.3 kDa) and CTF-7 (10 kDa), which were not present in
                            wild type brain, were detected in hippocampal and cerebellar regions of
                            end stage NPC1 mice. Similar APP-CTFs were also detected in rat primary
                            cortical neurons, and their levels were dramatically increased when
                            neurons were treated with the Ξ³-secretase inhibitor, DAPT (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 3.Progressive APP-CTF accumulation in NPC1 mouse

                                    = 12 for end stage samples, mean Β± S.E.).As in NPC1 mouse brain, the levels of Fl-APP in GM1 and Sandhoff disease
                            mice were highly similar to those in wild type brain, whereas the levels
                            of APP-CTFs in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar regions were
                            significantly elevated (Fig. 4,
                                A and B, p <
                            0.01 for GM1 and Sandhoff mice). The extent of APP-CTF accumulation in
                            both GM1 and Sandhoff brain was similar across all three brain regions,
                            with an almost 3-fold increase in the cortex (GM1, 299 Β±
                            79%; Sandhoff, 295 Β± 60%) and hippocampus (GM1, 287
                            Β± 42%; Sandhoff, 278 Β± 51%), and a 4-fold
                            increase in the cerebellum (GM1, 428 Β± 78%; Sandhoff, 361
                            Β± 56%). Considering cerebellar regions of GM1 and Sandhoff
                            mice did not have increased levels of LC3-II (Fig. 2), the observed increase in APP-CTFs may
                            reflect an autophagy-independent mechanism or a mild impairment in
                            autophagy not detectable by monitoring LC3-II.FIGURE 4.APP-CTFs accumulate in GM1 and Sandhoff mouse

                            and GM1 MiceConsidering APP-CTF levels were elevated in all three storage mouse
                            brains, and the 99-amino acid-long APP-CFTΞ² serves as a direct
                            substrate for production of AΞ², we investigated if AΞ² was
                            also increased. For this we used an established sequential extraction
                            procedure that allows for the isolation of (a)
                            cytosolic and interstitial AΞ² and (b)
                            lipid-associated AΞ² (32,
                                33) First, brains were
                            extracted in a DEA-containing buffer, followed by RIPA buffer
                            extraction. AΞ²40 was reliably detected in both the DEA and RIPA
                            extracts; however, AΞ²42 was below detectable levels so was not
                            included in the analysis. Total amounts of AΞ²40 were determined
                            from the sum of DEA and RIPA soluble extracts and were comparable
                            between wild type mice from each background and age (Fig. 5A). Total
                            AΞ²40 was almost 2-fold higher in NPC1 brain (1.1 Β± 0.06
                            fmol/mg wet weight) compared with wild type levels (0.54 Β± 0.1
                            fmol/mg wet weight, p < 0.05; Fig. 5A). Although there was a
                            trend indicating DEA-soluble AΞ²40 was raised in NPC1 mice, this
                            was not significant (Fig.
                                5B); however, AΞ²40 from RIPA-soluble
                            extracts was almost 2-fold higher in NPC1 brains (0.83 Β± 0.01
                            compared with 0.44 Β± 0.04 fmol/mg, wet weight, p
                            < 0.001, Fig.
                                5C), suggesting lipid-associated AΞ²
                            contributes largely to increased total AΞ²40 in NPC1. Although
                            total AΞ²40 was not altered in Sandhoff mice (Fig. 5A), RIPA-extractable
                            AΞ²40 was increased almost 3-fold (0.073 Β± 0.006 fmol/mg
                            wet weight) compared with wild type brain (0.27 Β± 0.01 fmol/mg
                            wet weight, p < 0.001; Fig. 5C). Decreased DEA-soluble AΞ²40
                            in Sandhoff mice (Fig.
                                5B) may explain why total AΞ²40
                            amounts were unchanged. Similar to NPC1 mice, total AΞ²40 was
                            significantly raised in brains of GM1 mice (0.67 Β± 0.06 fmol/mg
                            wet weight) compared with age-matched wild type mice (0.46 Β±
                            0.03, fmol/mg wet weight, p < 0.05; Fig. 5A). Although
                            RIPA soluble AΞ²40 was only marginally increased in GM1 mice (0.21
                            Β± 0.23 fmol/mg wet weight, compared with wild type, 0.15 Β±
                            0.02 fmol/mg wet weight, p < 0.05; Fig. 5C), GM1 mice
                            were the only mice to have significantly higher DEA-soluble AΞ²40
                                (p < 0.05; Fig.
                                5B). Preliminary studies using a formic acid
                            extraction of post-RIPA pellets did not reveal any indication of
                            insoluble aggregated AΞ² in any of the mouse models. Considering
                            the low propensity for murine AΞ² to aggregate (47), this was not unexpected.
                            Therefore, it is unlikely that the relative increases in AΞ²
                            contribute significantly to the extent of neurodegeneration seen in
                            these mice.FIGURE 5.Lipid-associated AΞ² accumulates in NPC1, Sandhoff

                            Neurons Recapitulate Trends Seen in Brains of GSL Storage Disease
                            MiceHaving characterized temporal and regional changes in LC3-II and APP-CTFs
                            in primary and secondary GSL storage disease mice, we proceeded to
                            investigate the effects of pharmacological agents that impair primary
                            and secondary lysosomal flux in cultured primary neurons. Direct
                            inhibition of primary lysosomal flux was achieved using chloroquine, a
                            lysomotropic agent that neutralizes endosomal-lysosomal pH and their
                            hydrolase activity, and a combination of leupeptin + pepstatin,
                            inhibitors of cysteine- and aspartic acid-cleaving lysosomal hydrolases.
                            Impairment of secondary lysosomal flux was achieved using U18666A, a
                            class II amphiphile that impairs late endosomal delivery to lysosomes by
                            inhibiting NPC1, and vinblastine, an agent that causes depolymerization
                            of microtubules and prevents vesicular transport. As expected, all four
                            drugs caused a time-dependent increase in LC3-II indicative of AV
                            accumulation (Fig. 6,
                                A and B). No change in the ratio
                            of phospho-p70/total p70 was found under any of these treatments, with
                            the exception of vinblastine, which decreased phospho-p70/total p70 at
                            24 h (data not shown). Overall, the observed AV accumulation under these
                            treatments was mTOR-independent and likely due to an impaired processing
                            of constitutively produced autophagosomes. Neuronal LC3-II amounts
                            rapidly increased upon treatment with U18666A (6 h) and vinblastine (1
                            h), but chloroquine and leupeptin + pepstatin (24 h) took longer
                            to induce a detectable increase. In addition to all four drugs causing
                            an increase in LC3-II, a concomitant increase in APP-CTF amounts was
                            also observed under these conditions. However, agents that acted
                            directly on lysosomal inhibition (chloroquine, leupeptin +
                            pepstatin) produced higher increases in APP-CTFs than agents that
                            indirectly impaired lysosomal flux (U18666A, vinblastine; Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6.Impaired lysosomal flux causes AV and APP-CTF accumulation

                                        n = 4, mean Β± S.E.In addition to using LC3-II levels as a marker of AV accumulation in
                            primary neurons, we also measured the autophagic sequestration of the
                            long lived cytosolic enzyme LDH (35). Similar to trends seen with LC3-II expression,
                            sequestered LDH was significantly increased by all treatments at the
                            24-h time point (Fig.
                                6D). Interestingly, the large amounts of
                            sequestered LDH seen in vinblastine-treated neurons indicate that
                            autophagosome formation is independent of microtubule integrity (48).Nascent Autophagosomes Do Not Contribute to APP MetabolismConsidering lysosomes are the terminal destination for cargo delivered by
                            both autophagic and endosomal routes, we applied a method used to
                            measure autophagic flux (49), to
                            determine whether an increased production of nascent autophagosomes
                            directly affects APP metabolism. After 24 h of treatment with rapamycin,
                            LC3-II was significantly increased, but APP-CTF levels were unaffected
                                (Fig. 7,
                                Aβ€“C). In agreement with our earlier
                            observation, neurons from the same culture treated with leupeptin
                            + pepstatin had higher levels of LC3-II and APP-CTFs (Fig. 6). Co-treatment with both
                            rapamycin and leupeptin + pepstatin caused a further increase in
                            LC3-II levels but did not significantly increase APP-CTF levels above
                            those of neurons treated with leupeptin + pepstatin alone.
                            Changes in LC3-II expression in autophagic flux experiments were also
                            observed in LDH sequestration studies (Fig. 7D). These data suggest that the extra
                            autophagosomes generated by rapamycin-induced autophagy activation did
                            not significantly alter APP metabolism. Moreover, it seems likely that
                            the accumulation of APP-CTFs seen under conditions of impaired lysosomal
                            flux does not result due to the accumulation of nascent autophagosomes
                            but rather is due to an impaired clearance of endosome-derived APP or
                            APP-CTFs.FIGURE 7.Increased formation of nascent autophagosomes does not

                                    conditions, mean Β± S.E.Further evidence that autophagy does not directly contribute to increased
                            amyloidogenic processing of APP comes from experiments where secreted
                            AΞ² was measured in conditioned media of the same neurons used to
                            assess effects of LC3-II and APP-CTFs (Fig. 7D). Rapamycin-induced autophagy
                            activation did not alter secretion of murine AΞ²40 or AΞ²42.
                            However, in two prior studies conflicting effects on AΞ² secretion
                            were reported during autophagy activation (42, 50). It
                            is worth noting that the results obtained from our study differ from
                            previous reports in that the levels of AΞ² we detected are
                            representative of the endogenously secreted levels from rat neurons that
                            do not overexpress APP. Thus, it would appear that in the absence of APP
                            overexpression, autophagy does not contribute to an increase or decrease
                            in the production of secreted AΞ². Interestingly, treatments that
                            impaired lysosomal flux and caused significant increases in
                            intracellular APP-CTFs did not affect AΞ² secretion, with the
                            exception of a minor decrease in AΞ²40 secretion seen in
                            U18666A-treated neurons. This suggests that basal production of
                            AΞ² from APP and subsequent secretion of monomeric AΞ²
                            occurs upstream of the lysosomal catabolism of APP-CTFs. However,
                            evidence that the intracellular accumulation of AΞ² can lead to
                            oligomerization (51) allows for
                            the possibility that cellular compartments containing undegraded
                            AΞ² or APP-CTFs may act as seeding zones for early amyloid
                            formation. Attempts were made to measure intraneuronal AΞ² from
                            cultured neurons; however, amounts produced under all conditions were
                            below the limit of detection of our ELISA (1 fmol/ml). This was
                            expected, considering the amount of available material from neuronal
                            lysates was far less than those used for brain tissue analysis.Neuronal AVs Predominantly Fuse with LysosomesAVs are known to deliver their cargo to lysosomes either directly through
                            the formation of autolysosomes or indirectly through amphisomes (52, 53). In this study, we considered the likelihood that normal
                            autophagosome trafficking may be altered under conditions where
                            lysosomal AV clearance is impaired. Co-localization between LC3-II and
                            early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), NPC1, the cation-independent mannose
                            6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), and LAMP1 was performed in leupeptin- and
                            pepstatin-treated neurons to determine the extent of fusion between
                            autophagosomes with early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes under
                            conditions where AV clearance was impaired. There was little or no
                            co-localization between LC3-II and markers of early or late endosomes
                                (Fig. 8,
                                Aβ€“C). However, LC3-II and the late
                            endosome/lysosome marker, LAMP1, showed extensive overlap (Fig. 8D). An absence
                            of AV-endosome fusion but predominant AV-lysosome fusion was also seen
                            in with rapamycin-, U18666A-, chloroquine-, and vinblastine-treated
                            neurons (data not shown). Considering these data indicate that neuronal
                            autophagosomes largely fuse with lysosomes, and autophagy activation did
                            not affect APP metabolism, we believe that macroautophagy does not
                            directly regulate the metabolism of APP.FIGURE 8.LC3-II positive AVs mainly fuse with lysosomes compared

entral to the pathogenesis of  is the metabolism of , which undergoes
                proteolytic processing and degradation in endosomal-lysosomal compartments (54β€“56). n light of previous
                reports that propose a role for autophagy in  metabolism (42, 43), and evidence
                that  metabolism is altered in 1 and 1 brains (14, 57β€“60), we assessed states of autophagy and  metabolism in three mouse
                models of  storage diseases to gain a better understanding of the role of
                autophagy in  metabolism.
n accordance with previous studies (39, 40, 61),
                we found substantially higher amounts of the  membrane marker, 3-, in 1,
                1 gangliosidosis, and andhoff disease mice. n 1 mice, 3- accumulation was
                present at 3 weeks, before - levels increased. owever, substantial increases
                in both were observed at the end stage of disease. nterestingly, mouse models of
                1 gangliosidosis and andhoff disease had disproportionately higher amounts of
                -s than 3- in the cerebellum, highlighting an obvious disparity between 
                amounts and  metabolism in this region. onsidering  accumulation in all three
                mouse models was m. TOR-independent, and APP-CTFs accompanied AV increases, we propose
                that AV accumulation in these diseases is likely to stem from impaired autophagic
                flux (38) and not from autophagy activation
                    (40).
Although lipid-associated AΞ²40 was increased in brains of NPC1, Sandhoff, and
                GM1 gangliosidosis mice, the amounts were very low and unlikely to contribute to the
                extensive neurodegeneration seen in these mice. The propensity for human AΞ²
                to aggregate may lead to larger AΞ² increases in human forms of these
                diseases. However, the main emphasis of this study is more concerned with
                understanding how alterations in normal EAL function impacts on intracellular
                mechanisms that regulate APP metabolism.
Although the in vivo data demonstrate different relationships
                between autophagy and APP metabolism in primary and secondary GSL storage diseases,
                specific manipulations of the EAL system in cultured neurons made it possible to
                delineate the involvement of primary and secondary lysosomal flux. Similar to
                results obtained from brain tissue of NPC1 mice, neurons treated with agents that
                affected secondary lysosomal flux (U18666A and vinblastine) effectively uncoupled AV
                and APP-CTF accumulation, with AV accumulation preceding APP-CTF accumulation.
                Alternatively, inhibition of primary lysosomal flux caused by chloroquine, leupeptin
                + pepstatin caused APP-CTF increases before AV accumulation. Thus in
                    vivo and in vitro data confirm that lysosomes are
                required for the processing of AVs and APP-CTFs but that APP-CTF accumulation occurs
                prior to AV accumulation when primary lysosomal flux is impaired. In contrast, AV
                accumulation induced by secondary lysosomal flux impairment is more sensitive than
                APP-CTF processing.
The lack of involvement of autophagy in APP metabolism was most apparent in
                rapamycin-treated neurons, which had increased amounts of LC3-II but did not show
                any alteration in full-length APP, APP-CTFs, or AΞ² secretion. Also, the
                absence of changes in full-length APP or AΞ² secretion, under conditions where
                primary and secondary lysosomal flux was impaired, suggests that that lysosomes are
                mainly involved in the catabolism of post-secretase APP-CTFs and are not involved in
                the constitutive regulation of AΞ² secretion. However, this does not exclude
                an important role for lysosomes in AD pathogenesis, as the amount of APP-CTFs that
                accumulated in neurons when lysosomal flux was impaired suggests lysosomes play a
                major role in the catabolic disposal of APP-CTFs that are not degraded by canonical
                secretase-mediated cleavage. Of particular note in this study was the
                characterization of five common APP-CTF bands (13.2β€“11.1 kDa) detected in all
                brain samples and in primary neurons. The observed molecular weights,
                immunoreactivity, and increase in the species following inhibition of
                Ξ³-secretase indicate that they are true Ξ³-secretase substrates. Two
                additional Ξ³-secretase APP-CTFs (CTF-6, 10.3 kDa; CTF-7, 10 kDa) were also
                detected in brains of GSL storage disease mice and in primary neurons treated with
                agents that impair lysosomal flux. The appearance of these two additional APP-CTFs
                suggests an ineffective attempt by lysosomes to clear the accumulated longer
                APP-CTFs or that these fragments are produced by noncanonical processing of APP.
                Interestingly, the biggest proportional increase in CTF-6 and -7 was seen in neurons
                treated with leupeptin + pepstatin. This indicates that either cysteine or
                aspartyl hydrolases are responsible for the normal turnover of CTF-6 and -7 or that
                inhibition of these hydrolases leads to an increase in their production through an
                alternative pathway. Considering Ξ²-CTFs can exert both direct and indirect
                neurotoxicity through the formation of AΞ² (62β€“65), the alternative cleavage of Ξ²-CTFs
                into lower molecular weight APP-CTFs that lack the AΞ² domain may represent an
                innate defense mechanism that could be utilized for therapeutic benefit.
Considering the many roles lipids serve in neurons, there is a growing interest in
                understanding their involvement in the aging brain and disease. From the regulation
                of APP processing under different lipid environments (66, 67), to the binding
                and aggregation of AΞ² to different lipids (68β€“70), AD research has moved beyond proteomics when considering
                the underlying pathogenesis of this disease. Lipids play an important role as both
                regulators and cargo of the EAL system, with cholesterol being a classic example of
                a lipid whose correct trafficking, esterification, and integration within membranes
                serve vital roles in cell function (18, 71). In this study, all three mouse models of
                GSL storage had significant alterations in their ability to process AVs and
                APP-CTFs. Whether these dysfunctions are caused by the nature of primary and
                secondary lysosomal storage itself or whether specific lipids contribute
                significantly to autophagic and APP pathology remains to be examined. However, the
                disparities observed between levels of LC3-II and APP-CTFs, lack of alteration in
                AΞ² secretion caused by modulation of autophagy, and the predominant
                co-localization of LC3-II with lysosomes indicate that autophagy largely bypasses
                endosomal compartments in neurons on their way to the lysosome, thus making it
                unlikely that autophagy is directly involved in the metabolism of APP (Fig. 9). This study emphasizes the
                anti-amyloidogenic role of lysosomal catabolism and suggests that improving the
                lysosomal clearance of accumulated AVs and APP metabolites may offer therapeutic
                benefit to patients with AD.
FIGURE 9.The Catabolism of APP-CTFs is independent of macroautophagy but
                            dependent on lysosomal flux. Following its partial proteolysis at
                        or close to the plasma membrane, a significant amount of APP-CTFs are
                        delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Under conditions of efficient
                        lysosomal flux, the generation of nascent autophagosomes did not directly
                        alter the expression of full-length APP, APP-CTFs, or the secretion of
                        AΞ², thus indicating that autophagy does not directly influence APP
                        metabolism. However, APP-CTFs and AΞ² accumulated under conditions
                        where either primary (Sandhoff and GM1 gangliosidosis) or secondary (NPC1)
                        lysosomal flux was impaired. Considering autophagic and endocytic cargo
                        converge at the lysosome, efficient lysosomal flux is essential for
                        degrading cargo from both routes. Note: the lysosome depicted here
                        represents an active lysosome receiving cargo from autophagic and endocytic
                        routes. LC3-II is present on autolysosomal but not lysosomal membranes.
