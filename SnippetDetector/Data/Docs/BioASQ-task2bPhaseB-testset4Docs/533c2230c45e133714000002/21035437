Vasa is a broadly conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase associated with germ line development and is expressed in multipotent cells in many animals. During embryonic development of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Vasa protein is enriched in the small micromeres despite a uniform distribution of vasa transcript. Here we show that the Vasa coding region is sufficient for its selective enrichment and find that gustavus, the B30.2/SPRY and SOCS box domain gene, contributes to this phenomenon. In vitro binding analyses show that Gustavus binds the N-terminal and DEAD-box portions of Vasa protein independently. A knockdown of Gustavus protein reduces both Vasa protein abundance and its propensity for accumulation in the small micromeres, whereas overexpression of the Vasa-interacting domain of Gustavus (GusÎ”SOCS) results in Vasa protein accumulation throughout the embryo. We propose that Gustavus has a conserved, positive regulatory role in Vasa protein accumulation during embryonic development.
