The SPRY domain is a protein interaction module found in 77 murine and ~100 human proteins, and is implicated in important biological pathways, including those that regulate innate and adaptive immunity. The current definition of the SPRY domain is based on a sequence repeat discovered in the splA kinase and ryanodine receptors. The greater SPRY family is divided into the B30.2 (which contains a PRY extension at the N-terminus) and "SPRY-only" sub-families. In this brief review, we examine the current structural and biochemical literature on SPRY/B30.2 domain involvement in key immune processes and highlight a PRY-like 60 amino acid region in the N-terminus of "SPRY-only" proteins. Phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses suggest that this N-terminal region is related to the PRY region of B30.2 and should be characterized as part of an extended SPRY domain. Greater understanding of the functional importance of the N-terminal region in "SPRY only" proteins will enhance our ability to interrogate SPRY interactions with their respective binding partners.
