<abstract>
In this study, chemical feature based pharmacophore models of MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 inhibitors have been developed with the aid of HypoGen module within Catalyst program package. In MMP-1 and MMP-13, all the compounds in the training set mapped HBA and RA, while in MMP-8, the training set mapped HBA and HY. These features revealed responsibility for the high molecular bioactivity, and this is further used as a three dimensional query to screen the knowledge based designed molecules. These pharmacophore models for collagenases picked up some potent and novel inhibitors. Subsequently, docking studies were performed for the potent molecules and novel hits were suggested for further studies based on the docking score and active site interactions in MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13.

chemical features responsible for activity. hese

Variety of biological processes such as embryonic development,
tissue remodeling and tissue repair involve controlled
degradation of extra cellular matrix (ECM). This feature is a
fundamental part of growth, invasion, and metastasis of
malignant tumors [1]. 
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a
family of extracellular zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases,
are collectively capable of degrading essentially all ECM
components. They are the prime factors indulged in breaking
down the extracellular matrix contributing to disease states
such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, tumor cell invasion and
metastasis [2β€“4]. They are classified according to their domain
structure into collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysin
and membrane type MMPs (MT-MMPs) [5].
Among MMPs, collagenases are intimately involved in collagen
homeostasis by post-translational proteolytic degradation. They
principally comprise MMP-1 (collagenase-1), MMP-8
(collagenase-2) and MMP-13 (collagenase-3) [6]. Collagenases
are the only endogenous enzymes that can readily cleave the
triple helical domain of fibrillar collagens I, II and III. Collagen
degradation is commenced by collagenases by making a sitespecific
cleavage about three-quarter of the distance from Nterminus,
followed by spontaneous collagen denaturation 
[7].
These interstitial collagenases degrade type I, II and III collagen
in cartilage; this is a committed step in the development of
rheumatoid arthritis as well as osteoarthritis and is revealed by
elevated levels of these collagenases [8,
9].
Collagenases show interesting differences in the crystal
structures, despite being highly homologous to one another. X
ray analyses of the enzymeβ€“inhibitor complex of collagenases
suggested that the S1' subunit is a selectivity pocket for
collagenase inhibitors [10β€“13]. The S1' subsite, also called the
S1'-specificity pocket, is the most prominent pocket within the
catalytic domain of collagenases. Differences in the relative size
and shape of the S1' pockets in MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13
suggest that this pocket is a critical determinant of MMP
inhibitor selectivity [1]. The quite flexible loop forms a major
portion of the S1' pocket and it undergoes a conformational
change on inhibitor binding [14,
15]. The loop is of the same
length in MMP-8 and MMP-13 and two residues are shorter in
MMP-1[16]. 
A comparison of the available 3D structure of
MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 shows the variability of amino
acid residues in the S1' loop. This variability of the amino acid
residues in the S1' loop causes difference in the shape of loops
[16]. 
The structural features of these enzymes are most decisive
in determining MMP substrate specificity and thereby inhibitor
specificity which is enclosed within the catalytic domain 
[17].
Synthetic inhibitors specifically targeting MMP-1, MMP-8 and
MMP-13 are unclear. Selectivity is more vital in minimizing the
detrimental effects during long term medical treatment 
[18]. It
has been reported that side effects were observed in the clinical
studies of collagenase inhibitors, because they showed broadspectrum
inhibition. Therefore, specific inhibition of MMP-1,
MMP-8 and MMP-13 are considered to be an attractive target in
drug discovery research [19,
20].
In the present study, we have generated pharmacophore
models using Catalyst [21,
22] software for a diverse set of
collagenase inhibitors (MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13) with an
aim to obtain pharmacophore model that would provide the
chemical features responsible for activity. These
pharmacophore features were used to screen the databases to
find novel inhibitors. Further induced fit docking was
performed to validate these inhibitors against MMP-1, MMP-8
and MMP-13. This in turn would be able to provide useful
knowledge for developing specific new and active drug
candidates targeting collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13).

Methodology
harmacophore modeling using atalyst: set of 337 -1 inhibitors with activity ranging from 0.4
n. M to 100000 nM, 148 MMP-8 inhibitors with activity ranging
from 0.13 nM to 78000 nM and 371 MMP-13 inhibitors with
activity ranging from 0.16 nM to 100000 nM were selected from
GOSTAR (gostardb.com). The molecules were divided into
training and test set for the development and validation of
pharmacophore models. The selection of training set is the most
crucial part as it determines the quality of generated
pharmacophore models. In this study, 21 of 337, 22 of 148 and
21 of 371 compounds were chosen for training set based on the
diversity observed in their chemical structures and
experimental activities for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13
respectively. The remaining compounds were used as test set
for pharmacophore validation process. All the molecules were
exported and then minimized using modified CHARMM force
field in catalyst package [21,
22]. For each molecule, a maximum
of 250 conformations were generated using the β€�best qualityβ€™
conformational search option within Catalyst's ConFirm
module. It generates the conformations using β€�Polingβ€™
algorithm. The molecules were then submitted to the catalyst
hypothesis generation.Model validation and Knowledge based screening:The best pharmacophore hypothesis was used initially to screen
316 MMP-1, 126 MMP-8 and 350 MMP-13 test set molecules.
The same model has also been used to select potent molecules
from 10,000 library molecules designed using Scaffold Hoping
(Knowledge based screening). Library molecules were
generated based on the knowledge of binding interaction of
known ligands reported with MMP-1, MMP-8 & MMP-13 and
also the common features necessary for biological activity of
molecule [24β€“26]. These molecules were built using Cerius2
software [27] 
and conformations for each compound were
generated using best conformational analysis. These molecules
were further screened for their activities using the developed
pharmacophore models.Ligand preparation:Ligand structures were built using Maestro v9.1 and
geometrically minimized using OPLS_2005 force field by
ligprep module of Maestro 9.1 (SchrΓ¶dinger suite, LLC) 
[28].
Ligprep produces a single, low energy, 3D structure for each
input structure with various ring conformations, ionization
states and tautomers using various criteria including molecular
weight or specified numbers and types of functional groups
present.Protein preparation:Protein preparation and refinement studies were performed on
MMP-1 (PDB ID: 1HFC), MMP-8 (PDB ID: 3DPE) and MMP-13
(PDB ID: 1XUC) using protein preparation module
(SchrΓ¶dinger suite, LLC) [28] in which the water molecules
were removed, hydrogen atoms were added, bond orders were
assigned and orientation of hydroxyl groups were optimized.
Finally, energy minimization was carried out using default
constraint of 0.3 β„« RMSD and OPLS 2005 force field.Induced fit docking:Induced fit docking method for protein structures of MMP-1,
MMP-8 and MMP-13 was performed using Induced fit docking
of Schrodinger package [28]. During docking process, the
ligands were optimized using OPLS or MMFF force field, thus
changing its conformation to find the best fit that can closely fit
to the S1' pocket of MMP-1,MMP-8 and MMP-13. The binding
affinity of each protein and ligand complex was reported as
Glide Score [29]. All graphic images were picturised using
PyMol program (www.pymol.org) [30]. Non-bonded
interactions like hydrophobic was observed using LigPlot
program [31] and these interactions can increase the binding
affinity between target drug interfaces.

Result & iscussion
ynthetic inhibitors taken for this study include hydroxamate,
non-hydroxamate, carboxylate, phosphinate,
aminocarboxylates, thiol, sulphonates, pyrrolidine, diazepine,
etc., which tends to have a greater inhibition towards s
[28]. 
ydroxamate diazepine and phenyl sulfonyl acetamide
inhibitors are potent inhibitors of -9 and -13 both in
vitro and in vivo, for osteoarthritis in rabbit model 
[32,
33]. ince
many of them have been quite potent and in some cases fairly
selective against collagenases, these molecules were further
taken as a basement to design the target specific inhibitors for
collagenases (-1, -8 and -13) using
pharmacophore modeling.
harmacophore generation and validation studies using ypo. Gen:Ten hypotheses were generated using 21 diverse training set
molecules for MMP-1 and MMP-13, and 22 molecules for MMP-
8 in HypoGen. (Figure 1 a, b & c) show some of the molecules
selected as the training set for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13.
The best hypothesis for MMP-1 and MMP-13 consists of 1) one
hydrogen bond acceptor, 2) one hydrogen bond donor and ring
aromatic whereas MMP-8 consists of 1) two hydrogen bond
acceptor, 2) one hydrogen bond donor and one hydrophobic.The values of ten hypotheses such as cost, correlation (r), and
root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) are statistically significant
Table 1A, 1B & 1C (see supplementary material). The
pharmacophore (Hypo-1, 11 and 21 for MMP-1, MMP-8 and
MMP-13 respectively) having high correlation coefficient (r),
lowest total cost, and lower RMSD value was chosen to estimate
the activity of test set. The best models Hypo-1,11 and 21 for
MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively has been given in
(Figure 2) and the parameters that describe Hypo-1, 11 and 21
for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively are shown in
Table 1A, 1B & 1C (see supplementary material).Two statistical methods were employed to rank the ten
resultant hypotheses. In the first method, all the ten hypotheses
were evaluated using a test set of known MMP-1, MMP-8 and
MMP-13 inhibitors, which are not included in the training set.
Predicted activities of the test set were calculated using all ten
hypotheses and correlated with the experimental activities. Of
the ten hypotheses, the best hypothesis Hypo-1 is characterized
by the highest cost difference (58.88), lowest RMSD value error
(0.87) and with correlation (0.89) for MMP-1. Hypo-11 is best
for MMP-8, with highest cost difference (64.95), lowest RMSD
value error (1.04) and correlation (0.85). Hypo-21 is the best
hypothesis for MMP-13 with highest cost difference (63.90),
lowest RMSD value error (1.15) and correlation (0.87). These
results conclude that Hypo-1, 11 and 21 are best ranking
pharmacophore for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively,
among the 10 hypotheses obtained. In MMP-1 and MMP-13, all
the compounds in the training set map hydrogen bond
acceptor (HBA) and ring aromatic (RA), while in MMP-8, the
training set map HBA and hydrophobic (HY) and these features
revealed that they should be mainly responsible for the high
molecular bioactivity. Thus this should be taken into account in
discovering or designing novel inhibitors. The most active
compounds 1, 22 and 44, has a highest fitness score of 6.80, 8.01
and 8.20 sequentially, when mapped Hypo-1, 11 and 21 to
MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively (Figure 3) whereas
the least active compounds 21, 43 and 64 maps to a lowest value
of 4.8, 4.13 and 5.73 (Figure 3). It is evident that as error, weight
and configuration components are very low and not
deterministic to the model, the total pharmacophore cost is also
low and close to the fixed cost. Also, as total cost is less than the
null cost, this model accounts for all the pharmacophore
features and has a good predictability power. A second
statistical test includes calculation of false positives, false
negatives, enrichment and goodness of hit to determine the
robustness of hypotheses. Under all validation conditions,
Hypo-1, 11 and 21 for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13
respectively performed superior as compared to the other
hypotheses and demonstrated excellent prediction of MMP-1,
MMP-8 and MMP-13 inhibitory activities of the training set
compounds Table 2A, 2B & 2C (see supplementary material).Analyzing the results, in MMP-1 out of 7 highly active
molecules, 5 were predicted correctly as highly active, and the
rest were predicted as moderately active. Among the 9
moderately active molecules, 6 molecules were predicted as
moderately active, 2 were predicted as highly active and 1 was
predicted as low active molecule. Out of 5 low active molecules,
one was predicted as moderately active and remaining was
predicted as low active. In MMP-8 out of 10 highly active
molecules, 8 were predicted correctly as highly active, and the
rest were predicted as moderately active. Among the 7
moderately active molecules, 2 molecules were predicted as
highly active 4 were predicted as moderately active and 1 was
predicted as low active molecule. Out of 5 low active
molecules, 2 were predicted as moderately active and rest was
predicted as low active. In MMP-13, out of 8 highly active
molecules, 6 were predicted correctly as highly active, and the
rest were predicted as moderately active. Among the 9
moderately active molecules, all molecules were predicted as
moderately active. Out of 4 low active molecules, 1 was
predicted as moderately active and rest was predicted as low
active. Activities of the compounds were correctly predicted
and fit values also confer a good measure of how well the
pharmacophoric features of Hypo-1, Hypo-11 and Hypo-21 for
MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively were mapped onto
the chemical features of the compounds. The best models
Hypo-1,11 and 21 for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively
has been given in (Figure 2) and the parameters that describe
Hypo-1, 11 and 21 for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13
respectively are given in Table 1A, 1B & 1C (see
supplementary material). Figure 3 shows all the features of
Hypo-1, 11 and 21 for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13
respectively (acceptor, donor, hydrophobic and ring aromatic)
that were mapped onto the highly active compounds of training
set (1, 22, and 44) and onto the inactive compound of training
set 21, 43 and 64 for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively.
The correlation values along with above predictions make the
pharmacophore suitable to predict molecular properties well.
Hypo-1, 11 and 21 was used to search the test set of known
MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 inhibitors respectively. Database
mining was performed using the BEST flexible searching
technique. The results were analyzed using a set of parameters
such as hit list (Ht), number of active percent of yields (%Y),
percent ratio of actives in the hit list (%A), enrichment factor of
2.91, 2.82 and 2.96 (E), false negatives, false positives, and
goodness of hit score of 0.75, 0.70 and 0.80 (GH). Hypo-1,
11 and 21 (for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 respectively)
succeeded in the retrieval of 80% of the active compounds. An
enrichment factor of 2.91, 2.82, 2.96 and a GH score of 0.75, 0.70,
0.80 indicates that the quality of the model is acceptable.Overall, a strong correlation was observed between the
predicted Hypo-1, 11, 21 and the experimental activity for
MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13 inhibitory (IC50) of the training
and test compounds. However, Hypo-1, 11 and 21 models has a
greater tendency to show false positives. This could be
attributed to high structural similarity in the active and inactive
MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 inhibitors, resulting in inability to
discriminate this pattern by pharmacophore models. We have
selected Hypo-1, 11 and 21 for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP -13
respectively as a 3D query to search a subset of knowledge
based designed database of 10,000 compounds to retrieve
compounds with novel structural scaffolds and desired
features. The initial screening of Hypo-1, 11 and 21 yielded 3000
compounds and further cluster analysis of these hits
corresponded to 220 unique cluster representatives. We further
extended this study to structure-based design to limit the
number of false positive hits and to further understand the
binding of inhibitors to the active site of all three MMPs.
(Figure 4 a, b & c) shows some of the identified and optimized
potent lead molecules through virtual library screening for
MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13.Docking studies for MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13:For furhter validation, docking is performed for 220 hits (MMP-
1, MMP-8 & MMP-13) using Induced fit docking mode of
Maestro. Most of the compounds show hydrogen bonding
interactions with the S1 pocket residues. Docking results shows
that known (yellow green) and newly identified compounds
(purple) occupy the S1' loop region with the almost similar
conformations. Especially, highly active compounds are
forming at least two specific or unique hydrogen bond
interactions in the S1' loop and shows high glide score with
collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13). The docking
scores and the hydrogen bonding interaction for newly
identified molecules with MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 were
shown in Table 3 (see supplementary material).. To investigate
the ligand binding affinity at the hydrophobic S1' pocket, we
further estimated the hydrophobic interactions using LIGPLOT
software (Figure 5). The hydrogen and hydrophobic
interactions of highly active ligands for MMP-1, MMP-8 and
MMP-13 are discussed below.Binding mode of molecule - 66 into the S1' loop of MMP-1:Docking results shows that both the ligands occupy the S1' loop
region with the almost similar conformation with a glide score -
7.816 and -7.089 Kcal/mol. LigPlot software was used to
understand the in-depth interaction pattern between both the
ligands and MMP-1. Hydrophobic interaction was identified
with amino acid residues Leu 140, Phe 207, Arg 214, Ile 232, Gly
233, Leu 235, Tyr 237, Ser 239, Tyr 240, Phe 242, Ser 243, Asp 245
and Gln 247. Both the ligands form hydrogen bonding
interaction with the Val 246 and specific amino acid residue
Asp 245 in the S1' loop region of MMP-1 (Figure 5).Binding mode of molecule - 69 into the S1' loop of MMP-8:Docking results shows that both the ligands occupy the S1' loop
region with the almost similar conformation with a glide score -
7.240 and -7.216 Kcal/mol. For the above two ligands
hydrophobic interaction was seen with amino acid residues Leu
160, Leu193, Val 194, His 197, Glu 198, Ala 213, Leu 214, Pro
217, Asn 218, Tyr 219, Ala 220, Arg 222, Thr 224 and Ser 228
using LigPlot software. Phenyl group in both the ligands
occupy the solvent exposed region including His 207, Ser 228
and Thr 224. Both the ligands form hydrogen bonding
interaction with the Pro 217 which is unique among MMP-8 and
also form pi-pi stacking with the Arg 222 in the S1' loop region
of MMP-8 (Figure 5).Binding mode of molecule -72 into the S1' loop of MMP-13:Docking results shows that both the ligands occupy the S1' loop
region with the almost similar conformation with a glide score -
10.892 and -9.203 Kcal/mol. Using LigPlot software,
hydrophobic interaction was seen with amino acid residues Leu
185, Leu 218, Val 219, His 222, Leu 239, Phe 241, Pro 242, Ile 243,
Thr 245, Tyr 246, Thr 247, Lys 249, Ser 250, His 251, Phe 252 and
Met 253. Both the ligands form hydrogen bonding interaction
with the specific amino residue with the Met 253. Molecule 72
additional ly forms interaction with the Thr 247 and Pro 242
and also forms pi-pi stacking with the Tyr 244 in the S1' loop
region of MMP-13 (Figure 5).
