The pharmacophore model (Hypo1) with a well prediction capacity for CysLT(1) antagonists was developed using Catalyst/HypoGen program. Virtual screening against an in-house database consisted of carboxylated chalcones using Hypo1 was performed. Retrieved hits 26a, 26b, 27a, and 27b were synthesized and biological evaluated, the results of which demonstrated that these compounds showed moderate to good CysLT(1) antagonistic activities. This study indicated that the generated model (Hypo1) is a reliable and useful tool in lead optimization for novel CysLT(1) antagonists.
