OBJECTIVE: To study the localization and expression of CLIC1 in mouse hepatocarcinoma ascites cell lines with different metastatic potentials. METHODS: Mouse hepatocarcinoma ascites models (a high potential of lymphatic metastasis cell line-Hca-F, and a low potential of lymphatic metastasis cell line-Hca-P) were investigated using fluorescent two-dimensional difference-gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) and mass spectrometry for detecting the localization and expression of CLIC1. Immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry and Western blot were used to assess CLIC1 protein status in the two cell lines. RESULTS: CLIC1 expression was obtained in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of cells in both cell lines. 2-D DIGE showed that CLIC1 was overexpressed in Hca-F cells, 1.6 folds higher than that of the Hca-P cells. Hca-F cells also had a higher integral membrane CLIC1 in the Hca-P cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although CLIC1 expression is detected in both Hca-F and Hca-P cell lines, a higher protein expression level is present in Hca-F cells. CLIC1 may play an important role in tumor metastasis.
