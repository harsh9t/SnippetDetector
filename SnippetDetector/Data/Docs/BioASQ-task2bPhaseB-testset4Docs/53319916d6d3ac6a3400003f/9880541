ERK7, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, has a carboxyl-terminal tail that is required for ERK7 activation, cellular localization, and its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis. To identify proteins that interact with ERK7, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen with the COOH-terminal tail of ERK7 as bait and isolated the cDNA for a novel protein termed CLIC3. The interaction between CLIC3 and ERK7 in mammalian cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. CLIC3 has significant homology to human intracellular chloride channels 1 (NCC27/CLIC1) and 2 and bovine kidney chloride channel p64. Like NCC27/CLIC1, CLIC3 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and stimulates chloride conductance when expressed in cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CLIC3 is a new member of the human CLIC family. The observed interaction between CLIC3 and ERK7 is the first demonstration of a stable complex between a protein that activates chloride ion transport and a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of signal transducers. The specific association of CLIC3 with the COOH-terminal tail of ERK7 suggests that CLIC3 may play a role in the regulation of cell growth.
