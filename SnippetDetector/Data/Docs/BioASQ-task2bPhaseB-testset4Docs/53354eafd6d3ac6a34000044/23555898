BACKGROUND: Yunnan has the longest endured Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) epidemic in China, and the genetic diversity of HIV-1 constitutes an essential characteristic of molecular epidemiology in this region. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the dynamic changes in Yunnan's HIV-1 epidemic, a cross-sectional molecular epidemiological investigation was carried out among recently infected individuals. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sequenced partial gag (HXB2∶781-1861) and env (HXB2∶7002-7541) genes from 308 plasma samples of recently infected patients. With phylogenetic analysis, 130 specimens generated interpretable genotyping data. We found that the circulating genotypes included: CRF08_BC (40.8%), unique recombinant forms (URFs, 27.7%), CRF01_AE (18.5%), CRF07_BC (9.2%), subtype B (2.3%) and C (1.5%). CRF08_BC was the most common genotype, and was predominant in both intravenous drug users (IDUs) and heterosexually transmitted populations. CRF08_BC and CRF07_BC still predominated in eastern Yunnan, but CRF08_BC showed increasing prevalence in western Yunnan. Strikingly, the URFs raised dramatically in most regions of Yunnan. Seven different types of URFs were detected from 12 prefectures, suggesting that complicated and frequent recombination is a salient feature of Yunnan's HIV-1 epidemic. Among URFs, two BC clusters with distinctive recombination patterns might be potential new CRF_BCs. CRF01_AE was no longer confined to the prefectures bordering Myanmar, and had spread to the eastern part of Yunnan, especially the capital city of Kunming, with a large number of infections in the transient population. The ratios of the main genotypes showed no statistical differences between infected IDUs and heterosexually transmitted infections. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The changing patterns of the dominant HIV-1 genotypes in Yunnan indicate the complex evolving dynamic nature of the epidemic. Understanding new trends in molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infection is critical for adjusting current prevention strategies and vaccine development in Yunnan.

Introduction
unnan is located in southwestern hina and has 16 prefectures and 129 counties. eographically, unnan borders yanmar, aos and ietnam and is situated along the drug trafficking routes that channel heroin into hina from southeast siaβ€™s opium-producing β€�olden riangleβ€� region. n 1989, the first uman mmumodeficiency irus () epidemic in hina was identified among intravenous drug users (s) in uili ounty of ehong refecture [1]. ince then, unnan has been one of the areas most affected by  in hina. urthermore, unnan serves as a primary entry point for the introduction of different -1 genotypes into hina. hus, unnan is considered as an epicenter of the -1 epidemic in hina.
n the late 1980s, hinaβ€™s first -1 epidemic among s was initiated by both subtype  (circulating in nited tates and urope) and subtype β€™ (the hailand variant of subtype , also referred to as hai-) strains imported from hailand to unnan by drug trafficking through yanmar [2], [3], [4]. n the early 1990s, another epidemic was introduced into unnan by ndian s with subtype  strains (ndia ) [5], [6]. n 1994, subtype  strains (now referred to as 01_) were identified among commercial sex workers who had returned from hailand to unnan [7]. ver time, the hai- subtype overtook the prototypical  subtype in frequency, increasing from 20% of all subtype  in 1990 to 90% in 1996 [2], [3], [4]. hus, subtype β€™ and subtype  strains co-circulated in unnanβ€™s s in the first half of 1990s. eanwhile, intravenous drug injection was the predominant transmission route in the early -1 epidemic of unnan [1], [8]. hese circumstances provided the opportunity for recombination between subtype β€™ and subtype  among the  population in unnan.
hough 07_ and 08_ were first detected from s in injiang rovince and uangxi rovince in 1997, respectively [9], [10], it is likely that these two s were initially established in unnan rovince [11], [12] and spread through two different overland heroin trafficking routes: 07_ northwestward to injiang rovince, and 08_ eastward to uangxi rovince [13]. equence analysis suggests that 07_ and 08_ are closely related and may have evolved from a common parent [14]. owever, understanding the origin of the two s in unnan required additional retrospective molecular epidemiological investigations.
ubsequently,studies carried out from 2001 to 2006 showed that there were three major groups circulating in unnan: /07_/08_, 01_ and  [15], [16]; /07_/08_ viruses included , 08_, 07_ and new  recombinants. lthough distributed widely, 08_ and 07_ largely dominated in eastern unnan. owever, new  recombinants were also found in western unnan [15], [16], [17]. 01_ was mainly distributed in the western region bordering yanmar, in prefectures such as ehong, aoshan, ishuangbanna and uer [15], [16]. tatistically, /07_/08_ and 01_ were dominant in s and those with sexually transmitted infections, respectively, suggesting that -1 subtype distribution was closely associated with risk factors.
-1 molecular epidemiological surveillance in new infections is of prime importance for understanding the real-time dynamics of the -1 epidemic in a region with complicated -1 subtype prevalence, such as unnan. he β€�gold standardβ€� method for measuring recent infections is a prospective cohort study. owever, cohort studies are difficult and expensive to implement and prone to biases that could reduce the general applicability of the results. s an alternative method, the -capture enzyme immunoassay () has been widely used to measure the proportion of -1-specific g. Gs among total IgGs in blood samples for the purpose of identifying infections that were acquired recently [18], [19]. Because the last large-scale HIV-1 molecular epidemiological study in Yunnan was done between 2002 and 2004 [16], we decided to evaluate the new HIV-1 subtype propagation. In this work, we performed a cross-sectional molecular epidemiological investigation among the recently infected population identified by BED-CEIA to uncover the new prevalent trends of HIV-1 genetic strains in Yunnan. We found that CRF08_BC was the most common genotype in Yunnan, and the distributions of the main HIV-1 genotypes showed no statistical differences between IDUs and the heterosexually transmitted population. Moreover, diverse recombinations emerged rapidly with the multiple genotypes co-existing in Yunnan.

Materials and ethods
tudy articipants and ample ollection. A total of 3034 HIV-1-positive plasma samples were identified between January 2009 and March 2009 from 461,661 individuals at local voluntary counseling and testing sites (VCT), medical institutions and sentinel surveillance sites in Yunnan Province. HIV-1 infection status was determined by an enzyme immunoassay and confirmed by Western blot assay (HIV BLOT 2.2, MP Diagnostics, Singapore). A total of 308 plasma samples identified as recent infections among 3034 HIV-1-positives were used for genotype analysis. Plasma was separated from whole blood and used to obtain HIV-1 RNA for subsequent analysis. All HIV tests are informed and voluntary. Written consents for HIV testing were obtained, in which the subjects agreed that if they have HIV, their samples can be used in the researches for the purpose of controlling and preventing HIV. Because no human experimentation and no investigation of host genetics were conducted, the authors were exempted from approval by the local ethical review committee at the Yunnan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.HIV-1 Seroconversion Identified with BED-CEIABED-CEIA was performed according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions (Calypte HIV-1 BED incidence EIA, Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Portland, OR) [20]. Test specimens were initially run singly. If the normalized OD (ODn) was >1.2, the specimen was classified as being from a long-term seroconverter. Specimens with ODn <1.2 were tested again in triplicate to confirm the values. In confirmatory testing, specimens with ODn values <0.8 were considered to have undergone recent seroconversion.Amplification of HIV-1 Gene FragmentsThree hundred and eight plasma samples identified as recent infections were used for genotype analysis. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 Βµl of plasma by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, United States) according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions, and was then subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate the fragments of the gag gene (HXB2β�¶781β€“1861) and the env gene (HXB2β�¶7002β€“7541). The gag fragment was amplified using One Step reverse transcription PCR (Takara, Dalian, China) with primers GAG-L (5β€²- TCGACGCAGGACTCGGCTTGC -3β€²) and GAG-E2 (5β€²- TCCAACAGCCCTTTTTCCTAGG -3β€²) in 25 Βµl reaction volume. Cycling conditions were as follows: 50Β°C for 30 min;94Β°C for 5 min, 55Β°C for 1 min,72Β°C for 2 min;94Β°C for 30 s,55Β°C for 45 s,72Β°C for 1 min 30 s,30 cycles;72Β°C for 10 min. The nested gag PCR was performed using 2Γ—Taq PCR MasterMix (Tiangen, Beijing, China) with primers GUX (5β€²-AGGAGAGAGATGGGTGCGAGAGCGTC-3β€²) and GDX (5β€²- GGCTAGTTCCTCCTACTCCCTGACAT-3β€²) in 50 Βµl reaction volume. Cycling conditions: 94Β°C for 2 min, 55Β°C for 1 min,72Β°C for 1 min 30 s;94Β°C for 30 s,55Β°C for 45 s,72Β°C for 1 min 30 s,30 cycles;72Β°C for 10 min. The env fragment was amplified with primers 44F (5β€²-ACAGTRCARTGYACACATGG-3β€²) and 35R (5β€²-CACTTCTCCAATTGTCCITCA-3β€²) with cycling conditions: 50Β°C for 30 min;94Β°C for 2 min, 50Β°C for 1 min,72Β°C for 4 min;94Β°C for 30 s,55Β°C for 30 s,72Β°C for 2 min,30 cycles;72Β°C for 10 min. The nested env PCR was performed with primers 33F (5β€²- CTGTTIAATGGCAGICTAGC -3β€²) and 48R (5β€²- RATGGGAGGRGYATACAT -3β€²) in 50 Βµl reaction volume; Cycling conditions: 95Β°C for 2 min; 95Β°C for 15 s,55Β°C for 30 s,72Β°C 1 min 15 s, 5 cycles;95Β°C for 15 s,60Β°C for 30 s,72Β°C for 1 min,25 cycles; 72Β°C for 10 min. Each step was carried out with appropriate negative controls to detect possible contamination during the experiments. The generated products were analyzed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Positive samples were sent to Biomed Co. (Beijing, China) for sequencing by using an ABI 3730XL automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA) with sequencing primers: GUX/GDX (for gag) and 33F/48R (for env).Sequence AnalysisThe contig assembly of sequences was performed using DNA sequence analysis software Sequencher 4.9 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). The ClustalW Multiple alignment and manual editing were performed using Bio-Edit 7.0 software. The reference sequences were obtained from the NIH/NIAID-funded HIV Databases (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/content/index), covering the major HIV-1 subtypes/CRFs. Some reference sequences which were previously characterized in China and countries surrounding Yunnan were included. Phylogenetic tree analyses were performed using the neighbor-joining method based on Kimura 2-parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates, using MEGA version 4.0 [21]. To demonstrate possible intertype mosaicism, candidate sequences were analyzed using the Recombination Identification Program (RIP; version 3.5.1) which is available at the HIV sequence database (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov) using the appropriate parameters. Similarity plot analyses (version 3.5.1; S. Ray, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) were further performed using reference strains of subtype A1, subtype A2, subtype B, subtype C, subtype D, subtype F1, subtype J, CRF01_AE and CRF08_BC. The conditions are further descried in the figure legends.Geographic Distribution Analysis of HIV-1 GenotypesHIV-1 genetic geographic distribution was analyzed with the public health geographic information system (PHGIS, China CDC). A Dot Density Map was used to display the distribution density of each HIV-1 genotype within Yunnan Province. For each genotype, the number of patients with the genotype in each prefecture was divided by 130 (the total number of patients in this study) to obtain the percentage of each genotype in each prefecture. When using PHGIS to map the data, one dot was defined as 0.025% of the population.Sequence DataAll the sequences obtained in this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers JX263434 to JX263661.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses for this report were conducted using the SPSS 17.0 statistical analysis software package (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). Categorical variables were compared using Ο‡2. All tests were two-tailed and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
emographic haracteristics of tudy ubjects. A total of 3034 newly diagnosed HIV-positive samples were collected from VCT, medical case reports and sentinel surveillance in Yunnan Province during the first quarter of 2009. Of these, 308 samples were identified as recent infections, all of which were used for the HIV-1 genetic analysis. For each sample, gag and env genes were amplified and sequenced. In total, we obtained 120 gag sequences and 108 env sequences. Combining the phylogenetic tree analysis of gag and env, we successfully genotyped 130 samples with a rate of 42.2% (130/308). The failure of amplification was most commonly due to poor storage and transportation conditions of samples. The constituent ratios of the 130 subjects genotyped and the total of 308 recently HIV-infected individuals showed no statistical differences by geographical area, gender, age, ethnicity, marital status and infection routes (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0060101.t001Table 1The distribution of subjects successfully genotyped.BED-CEIA positive subjectsSubjects with identified subtypesΟ‡2PTotal308130Prefecture4.4600.996Baoshan137Chuxiong134Dali188Dehong5225Diqing00Honghe5522Kunming5117Lijiang31lincang228Nujiang11Puer103Qujing2011Wenshan2913Xishuangbanna85Yuxi72Zhaotong63Gender0.2800.599Male17477Female13453Age4.7980.310β‰¤2028921β€“301315231β€“40853941β€“504113β‰¥512317Race/ethnicity3.1720.682Han21294Dai2410Yi143Hani102Jingpo96Others3915Marital Status0.1850.909Unmarried10642Married16773Divoiced/Widowed3515Infection Routes3.9690.400Heterosexual contact225100Intravenous drug injection6120Homosexual contact73Maternal-neonatal transmission55Unknown102As shown in Table 1, among the 130 subjects, the ratio of males to females was 1β�¶0.69. The mean age was 33.9 years (range: 1β€“79 years); And 72.3% (94/130) of individuals were of Han ethnicity, and 27.7% of individuals were minority nationality, including Dai, Jingpo, Bai, Yi, Zhuang, Hani, Miao, Wa, Yao, Buyi, Hui and Menggu. Heterosexual transmission was the chief transmission route, accounting for 76.9% (100/130), and intravenous drug injection ranked second, accounting for 15.4% (20/130), while other transmission routes that included homosexual transmission, maternal-neonatal transmission and unknown routes, accounted for 7.7% (10/130) of infections.HIV-1 Genotype Analysis in Recent InfectionsPhylogenetic analyses of 120 gag fragments (912 bp, encoding portions of p17 and p24), and env fragments (477 bp, encoding V3β�ΌV4 region) were performed (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). As Among 120 gag sequences, 59 (49.2%), 12 (10.0%), 3 (2.5%), 5 (4.2%) and 24 (20.0%) sequences were identified as CRF08_BC, CRF07_BC, subtype C, subtype B and CRF01_AE, respectively (Fig. 1). The remaining 17 sequences clustered between or outsite of the clades of subtypes/CRFs, suggesting that they might be intersubtype recombinations. To verify whether they are recombinants, bootscanning analyses using Simplot software were performed, which revealed 4 recombinant forms, including 14 BC, 1 CRF01_AE/CRF08_BC, 1 CRF01_AE/C and 1 B/CRF08_BC/CRF01_AE recombinants (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4A). Among BC recombinants, two discrete BC clusters were identified, in which the BC recombinants found previously in western Yunnan [11], [17] were also clustered (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, each BC cluster shared a similar recombination pattern in gag region (Fig. 3). This suggests that potential BC Circulating Recombinant Forms might circulate in this region. Phylogenetic and bootscanning analyses of env region revealed 31 (28.7%) CRF01_AE, 3 (2.8%) subtype B, 71 (65.7%) subtype C, 2 (1.9%) CRF01_AE/C and 1 (0.9%) A1/B (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4B).10.1371/journal.pone.0060101.g001Figure 1Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of partial gag gene from recently infected individuals confirmed by BED-CEIA.A, Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for 120 gag sequences and relative reference sequences.

Among the recent infections, CRF08_BC was the most common genotype (40.8%, 53/130), followed by the URFs (27.7%, 36/130), CRF01_AE (18.5%, 24/130), CRF07_BC (9.2%, 12/130), subtype B (2.3%, 3/130) and subtype C (1.5%, 2/130) (Table 2).10.1371/journal.pone.0060101.t002Table 2Demographic characteristics and subtypes of study subjects.SubjectsGenotypesBCCRF01_AECRF07_BCCRF08_BCURFsΟ‡2PTotal130 (100.0%)3 (2.3%)2 (1.5%)24 (18.5%)12 (9.2%)53 (40.8%)36 (27.7%)Gender7.3730.161Male77 (59.2%)2 (1.5%)1 (0.8%)13 (10.0%)10 (7.7%)26 (20.0%)25 (19.2%)Female53 (40.8%)1 (0.8%)1 (0.8%)11 (8.5%)2 (1.5%)27 (20.8%)11 (8.5%)Age4.9210.296aβ‰¤209 (6.9%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)5 (3.8%)0 (0.0%)2 (1.5%)2 (1.5%)21β€“3052 (40.0%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)9 (6.9%)6 (4.6%)23 (17.7%)14 (10.8%)31β€“4039 (30.0%)2 (1.5%)1 (0.8%)7 (5.4%)4 (3.1%)14 (10.8%)12 (9.2%)41β€“5013 (10.0%)0 (0.0%)1 (0.8%)3 (2.3%)1 (0.8%)6 (4.6%)2 (1.5%)β‰¥5117 (13.1%)1 (0.8%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)1 (0.8%)9 (6.9%)6 (4.6%)Race/Ethnicity11.8860.022Han94 (72.3%)0 (0.0%)1 (0.8%)21 (16.2%)10 (7.7%)39 (30.0%)23 (17.7%)Others36 (27.7%)3 (2.3%)1 (0.8%)3 (2.3%)2 (1.5%)14 (10.8%)13 (10.0%)Marital Status10.6920.317Unmarried42 (32.3%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)12 (9.2%)5 (3.8%)14 (10.8%)11 (8.5%)Married73 (56.2%)2 (1.5%)2 (1.5%)11 (8.5%)5 (3.8%)34 (26.2%)19 (14.6%)Divorced/Widowed15 (11.5%)1 (0.8%)0 (0.0%)1 (0.8%)2 (1.5%)5 (3.8%)6 (4.6%)Infection Routes6.9400.173bHeterosexual contact100 (76.9%)2 (1.5%)1 (0.8%)17 (13.1%)9 (6.9%)44 (33.8%)27 (20.8%)Intravenous drug injection20 (15.4%)1 (0.8%)1 (0.8%)1 (0.8%)3 (2.3%)7 (5.4%)7 (5.4%)Homosexual contact3 (2.3%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)3 (2.3%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)Maternal-neonatal transmission5 (3.8%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)3 (2.3%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)2 (1.5%)Unknown2 (1.5%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)2 (1.5%)0 (0.0%)aNon parametric Kruskal Wallis test was applied.bCompared the constitutions of subtypes between heterosexual contact and intravenous drug injection.Interestingly, the proportion of the URFs exceeded that of CRF01_AE and ranked second, which suggested that new recombination occurs frequently among the HIV-1 recently-infected population. Among the URFs, two types of recombination patterns existed. In pattern one, as mentioned above, mosaic construction was detected in gag or env region (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). In pattern two, URFsβ€™ gag and env region belonged to different subtypes or CRFs, respectively. As shown in Table 2 and Tabel 3, 69.4% (25/36) of the individuals with URFs were male, and 27 individuals with URFs (75.0%) were infected through heterosexual contact, while seven (19.4%) through intravenous drug use and two (5.6%) through maternal-neonatal transmission. Furthermore, CRF01_AE was involved in 55.5% (20/36) of the URFs (Table 3). Among all the URFs, BC recombinants were the most common recombinant form (41.7%, 15/36); the other six discrete URFs included CRF01_AE/C (27.8%, 10/36), CRF08_BC/CRF01_AE (19.4%, 7/36), CRF01_AE/B (2.8%, 1/36), CRF01_AE/BC (2.8%, 1/36), B/CRF08_BC/CRF01_AE (2.8%, 1/36) and A1/B (2.8%, 1/36). Since subtype C, CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC cannot be distinguished in the env region, the CRF01_AE/C group may include the following recombinants: CRF01_AE/C, CRF01_AE/CRF08_BC, and CRF01_AE/CRF07_BC.10.1371/journal.pone.0060101.t003Table 3Demographic and genetic characteristics of 28 individuals with new recombinants.Case NumberPrefectureSexAgeTransmission RoutegagenvURFsYNDH09R006DehongMale23Intravenous drug injectionBC\BCYNDH09R010DehongMale36Intravenous drug injectionBCCBCYNDH09R011DehongMale37Heterosexual contactBC\BCYNDH09R016DehongFemale23Heterosexual contactBC\BCYNDH09R027DehongMale6Maternal-neonatal transmissionBC\BCYNDH09R028DehongFemale21Heterosexual contactBCCBCYNDH09R032DehongFemale44Heterosexual contactBC\BCYNDH09R039DehongFemale23Heterosexual contactBCCBCYNDH09R042DehongMale23Intravenous drug injectionBCCBCYNDH09R043DehongMale11Maternal-neonatal transmissionBC\BCYNDH09R045DehongFemale31Heterosexual contactBCCBCYNDH09R047DehongMale32Heterosexual contactBCCBCYNDH09R049DehongFemale37Heterosexual contactBCBCYNHH09R091HongheFemale26Heterosexual contactBCCBCYNHH09R100HongheMale38Intravenous drug injectionBC\BCYNBS09R162BaoshanMale33Heterosexual contactCRF01_AE/CCRF01_AECRF01_AE/CYNBS09R164BaoshanMale45Heterosexual contactCRF01_AECCRF01_AE/CYNBS09R253BaoshanMale34Heterosexual contactCCRF01_AECRF01_AE/CYNDL09R200DaliMale63Heterosexual contactCRF01_AECCRF01_AE/CYNDH09R024DehongMale22Intravenous drug injection\CRF01_AE/CCRF01_AE/CYNSCDC09R172QujingMale27Heterosexual contactCRF01_AECCRF01_AE/CYNQJ09R191QujingFemale23Heterosexual contactCRF01_AECCRF01_AE/CYNQJ09R229QujingMale30Intravenous drug injectionCRF01_AECCRF01_AE/CYNBN09R211XishuangbannaFemale61Heterosexual contactCRF01_AECCRF01_AE/CYNBN09R234XishuangbannaMale54Heterosexual contactCRF01_AECCRF01_AE/CYNCX09R155ChuxiongFemale27Heterosexual contactCRF08_BCCRF01_AECRF08_BC/CRF01_AEYNHH09R108HongheMale21Heterosexual contactCRF01_AE/CRF08_BCCRF01_AECRF08_BC/CRF01_AEYNSCDC09R173KunmingMale57Heterosexual contactCRF08_BCCRF01_AECRF08_BC/CRF01_AEYNLJ09R208LijiangMale22Heterosexual contactCRF08_BCCRF01_AECRF08_BC/CRF01_AEYNQJ09R193QujingMale38Intravenous drug injectionCRF08_BCCRF01_AECRF08_BC/CRF01_AEYNYX09R185YuxiMale76Heterosexual contactCRF08_BCCRF01_AECRF08_BC/CRF01_AEYNZT09R243ZhaotongMale40Heterosexual contactCRF08_BCCRF01_AECRF08_BC/CRF01_AEYNCX09R157ChuxiongMale23Heterosexual contactCRF01_AEBCRF01_AE/BYNBS09R252BaoshanFemale34Heterosexual contactBCRF01_AE/CCRF01_AE/BCYNDH09R052DehongMale60Heterosexual contact\A1/BA1/BYNWS09R137WenshanMale36Heterosexual contactB/CRF08_BC/CRF01_AECB/CRF08_BC/CRF01_AEDistribution Characteristic of HIV-1 Genotypes by Infection RoutesTo better characterize the distribution of HIV-1 genotype, we performed a detailed demographic study. The distribution of genotypes by gender, age, or marital status of patients showed no significant differences (Table 2). However, the distribution of genotypes by ethnicity showed statistical difference, mainly because subtype B was confined to Dai and Yi ethnicities. We found intermixing of subtypes/CRFs in different infection routes. In the heterosexually transmitted population, CRF08_BC accounted for 44.0% (44/100), URFs for 27.0% (27/100), CRF01_AE for 17.0% (17/100), CRF07_BC for 9.0% (9/100), subtype B for 2.0% (2/100), and subtype C 1.0% (1/100). In IDUs, CRF08_BC accounted for 35.0% (7/20), URFs for 35.0% (7/20), CRF07_BC for 15.0% (3/20), subtype C for 5.0% (1/20), CRF01_AE for 5.0% (1/20), and subtype B for 5.0% (1/20). These data showed that CRF08_BC has become the predominant viral genotype both in heterosexuals and IDUs. Further, genotypic distribution showed no statistical difference in these two populations (Table 2), suggesting that genotypes tend to randomly distribute among patients infected through heterosexual contact and intravenous drug use, and the separation of subtype/CRF by different risk groups appears to have diminished. Otherwise, three CRF01_AE strains and two URFs were detected in maternal-neonatal transmission, and three CRF01_AE strains in the homosexually transmitted population (Table 2). Finally, the distribution of different types of URFs in different infection routes showed no statistical difference (Table 4).10.1371/journal.pone.0060101.t004Table 4The distribution of URFs in different transmission routes.Infection RoutesBCCRF01_AE/CCRF08_BC/CRF01_AECRF01_AE/BCRF01_AE/BCB/CRF08_BC/CRF01_AEA1/BTotalΟ‡2PHeterosexual contact98611112710.0230.912Intravenous drug injection42100007Maternal-neonataltransmission20000002Total15107111136Geographic Distribution Characteristic of HIV-1 GenotypesFinally we analyzed the geographic distribution of each HIV-1 genotypes. CRF08_BC was distributed almost throughout the whole province, except Baoshan, Lijiang and Diqing (Fig. 5A). In line with the previous report, this viral genotype predominated in east Yunnan, including 3 highly affected prefectures: Wenshan, Honghe and Kunming. Additionally, the prevalence of CRF08_BC increased in west Yunnan, especially in Dali and Lincang. Conversely, CRF07_BC was mainly distributed in the eastern region including Honghe, Kunming and Qujing (Fig. 5B). Previously, CRF01_AE was limited to the western prefectures (Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang). In this study, we found that CRF01_AE had spread to the eastern prefectures (Kunming, Honghe and Wenshan), and predominated in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan (Fig. 5C). Traditionally, subtypes B and C were confined in Dehong where these two subtypes were first introduced into Yunnan in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Here, we found that subtype B and C still predominated in Dehong, and separate subtype B strains were found in Honghe (Fig. 5D and 5E). The 36 URFs distributed widely, and were in 12 prefectures (Fig. 5F). There were five prefectures with more than one type of URF detected (Dehong, Baoshan, Chuxiong, Honghe and Qujing). In line with the distribution of subtype B and C, BC recombinants predominated in Dehong, while CRF01_AE/C and CRF08_BC/CRF01_AE were not limited to the local area, but were scattered widely.10.1371/journal.pone.0060101.g005Figure 5Geographic distribution of the main genotypes in Yunnan.A, B, C, D, E and F are Dot Density Map for CRF08_BC, CRF07_BC, CRF01_AE, subtype B, subtype C and URFs, respectively, which showed the percentage of each genotype in each prefecture.

Discussion
n the present work, we conducted an -1 molecular epidemiological study to disclose new trends in recently-infected individuals of unnan rovince, the province most severely affected by / in hina. y analyzing the -1 genes gag and env, we described the distribution characteristic of -1 subtypes, s and s in this area. e found that 08_ was the most common , which predominated in both east and west unnan among s and the sexually transmitted population. xceeding the frequency of 01_, s became the second most common -1 strain which suggests continuous risk behavior still exists among certain groups. mportantly, the distribution of these genotypes was not closely associated with transmission route.
y the end of 2011, the cumulative number of reported / in unnan was 95296, accounting for 21.0% of the total national figure. unnan has shown more diverse -1 genetics than any other -1 high-prevalent province in hina, including uangxi, ichuan, ijiang, uangdong and ennan [22], [23]. he early reports on characterization of -1 genotypes in unnan were confined to the  population, which revealed multiple -1 genotypes, including , β€™, , 01_, 07_, 08_ and  [2], [3], [5], [9], [11], [16], [17], [24]. uring the transition of main transmission route from intravenous injection to sexual contact, diverse -1 strains were also identified among individuals who acquired -1 through sexual contact [15], [16], [24]. dditionally, phylogenetic analysis showed that sequences from s intermingled with those from individuals infected through sexual contact within each subtype of -1 [24], which suggested -1 strains circulating in the sexually transmitted population might come from those in s through commercial or non commercial sex contacts.
n the early 2000s, 08_ and 01_ were dominant in s and those with sexually transmitted infections, respectively [1], [16]. t that time, it was presumed that the prevalence of 01_ would increase with sexual transmission rising [16]. owever, in recently infected people, we found that 08_ predominated not only in s, but also in the heterosexually transmitted population. he influx of 08_ into the heterosexually transmitted population may occur through male s who visit female sex workers (s) as well as s who inject drugs. hese groups have played a crucial role in the transition of the epidemic from being primarily -driven to sexually driven [25]. nother possible reason is the transmission from -1 positive s to their spouses and regular sexual partners through unprotected sex. urthermore, the distributions of the main -1 genetic strains showed no statistical differences between s and the heterosexually transmitted population. his suggests that these strains tended to randomly distribute into these two populations, and the phenomenon observed in previous studies [15], [16] of different subtypes/ predominating in different risk groups appears to have diminished. he changing characteristics of -1 molecular epidemiology suggest that the bridging population is still the primary force behind the development of the -1 epidemic in unnan. hus, measures for effective epidemic control should be further developed and performed among the high-risk groups, particularly s, commercial sex workers and the spouses of -1 positive individuals. ey strategies should include behavior intervention, scaling up identification of -1 infected persons among the high risk groups, and providing antiretroviral therapy () to them to effectively reduce -1 incidence by decreasing the viral load level.
ecombination between -1 genotypes is an important mechanism that contributes substantially to the genetic complexity of -1 and may result in establishing epidemiologically important founder strains. he coexistence of multiple genotypes in the same area always causes the formation of s. ypically, 07_ and 08_ have been thought to originate among s in unnan [11], [12], but how this occurred was not well-understood. his past lack of knowledge may have been the result of the use of the env region only in earlier studies [2], [6]. 07_ and 08_ are composed mostly of subtype  and contain a few small segments of subtype β€™. hus, distinguishing between 07_/08_ and subtype  based on the env region alone would have been difficult. t has been reported that the nearly full-length genome analyses of the env-based subtype  samples revealed that they were actually  recombinants [11]. n this study, we found two discrete  clusters. he sequences in these two clades also clustered together with those of the  recombinants detected in western unnan in the late 1990s and early 2000s [11], [17]. urthermore, each cluster has its own recombination pattern in gag region, which is distinct from those of 07_ and 08_. ll of this suggests that new s_ might have been established in this area. o prove this hypothesis, the complete sequencing of full-length -1 genomes is required in future research.
esides s, another striking result is that diverse s arise continually. s reported before mainly included new  recombinants, 07_/08_ recombinants, and /01_ recombinants [11], [16], [17], [26], [27], [28], [29], most of which were found among s. n this work, we found that the types and quantity of s increased among recent infections. he frequency of s was exceeded only by that of 08_. f the seven types of s detected, nearly 70% were identified among heterosexually-infected individuals, and 55.5% were 01_ relative s. n unnan, 01_ was first found among s [7], and was the preponderant strain in this population in the early stage of the -1 epidemic [1], [16]. he high proportion of 01_ relative s suggests that active recombination took place through commercial sex behavior. he geographic distribution of s is growing and covered 12 out of the 16 prefectures. ll of these contributed substantially to the genetic complexity of -1 in unnan. he formation and linkage of these s will be our research focus in the future, which will elucidate the development of the -1 epidemic of unnan, and provide references for  control in this area.
urthermore, the -1 strains showed different temporal and spatial dynamics in the process of spreading. e found that 07_ and 08_ were both highly prevalent in east unnan, but 08_ was distributed more widely than 07_, covering almost the entire province. resently, we do not know whether the transmission capacities of these two s differ. 01_ spread to east unnan, particularly in unming where the proportion of 01_ remained at a low level in the early 2000s [30]. hus, a general trend was that -1 strains transferred from their original highly-prevalent area to the rest of the province. he specificity and dynamics of -1 transmission also resulted in the different distribution of -1 genotypes in different areas. or example, ehong and onghe showed the most complicated -1 genetic diversity in the east and the west, respectively. owever, their distribution patterns were totally different. 08_ was predominant in onghe, while  recombinants and subtype  mainly circulated in ehong. n the other hand, the neighboring prefectures shared similar distribution patterns, such as onghe and enshan, uxi and huxiong, ali and incang.
ince the first acknowledged -1 epidemic in hina began in unnan, this region has become a critical area bridging -1 epidemics in southeast sia with the subsequent inland epidemic. hrough durg trafficking, some genotypes originally found in unnan had spread not just to the neighboring provinces of uangxi (08_) [12], [31], [32], [33], [34] and ichuan (07_) [35], but also to the north-western province of ijiang (07_) [12], [35] and the central province of enan (subtype β€™) [36]. n the other hand, the countries bordering unnan display their own characteristics of -1 molecular epidemiology. n ietnam, 01_ is the predominant strain [37]. owever, in yanmar, besides β€™,  and 01_, recombinant forms between β€™,  and 01_ are increasing dramatically [38].  similar trend is seen in ehong, where the proportion of s is higher than any other subtype/. hese suggest that the hina-yanmar border area constitutes a hot spot of active recombination in sia. he bidirectional transmission of -1 between unnan and neighboring countries means that the epidemic of unnan could potentially influence neighboring countries. ll of this suggests that the main strains prevailing in hina and neighboring countries could be found in unnan. hus, comprehensively understanding -1 molecular epidemical characteristics in unnan plays an important role in efficient control of the -1 epidemic, as well as vaccine design and evaluation for hina and the neighboring countries.
ne limitation of this work was the relatively low  amplification rate (gag: 39.0%, 120/308; env: 35.1%, 108/308), which also occurrd in our previous work [16]. he reasons may be  degradation owing to poor serum storage and transportation conditions. n fact, the plasma specimens had been used for -1 screening, confirmation and - before genetic analysis was performed, during which time the samples underwent several freeze-thaw cycles. ther reasons may include low viral load in some cases and sequence variations at the primer binding sites. he low amplification rate meant that some low-frequent viral genotype might be missed, however it is unlikely to compromise the interpretation of the general genetic distribution. his is because the constituent ratios of the 130 subjects with definite genotyping and the total of 308 recently -infected individuals showed no statistical differences by area of source, gender, age, ethnicity, marital status and infection routes.
n summary, we found that six -1 genotypes circulated in the recently infected individuals of unnan, and the distribution of the main genotypes was not closely associated with transmission route. -1 genetics became more diverse because of frequent intersubtypes/s recombinations. hese findings showed new trends of -1 molecular epidemiology with dynamic changes in the -1 epidemic and will contribute to a better understanding of the distribution and evolution of -1 in unnan as well as help to establish and modify public health efforts to prevent new infections.Discussion
In the present work, we conducted an HIV-1 molecular epidemiological study to disclose new trends in recently-infected individuals of Yunnan Province, the province most severely affected by HIV/AIDS in China. By analyzing the HIV-1 genes gag and env, we described the distribution characteristic of HIV-1 subtypes, CRFs and URFs in this area. We found that CRF08_BC was the most common CRF, which predominated in both east and west Yunnan among IDUs and the sexually transmitted population. Exceeding the frequency of CRF01_AE, URFs became the second most common HIV-1 strain which suggests continuous risk behavior still exists among certain groups. Importantly, the distribution of these genotypes was not closely associated with transmission route.
By the end of 2011, the cumulative number of reported HIV/AIDS in Yunnan was 95296, accounting for 21.0% of the total national figure. Yunnan has shown more diverse HIV-1 genetics than any other HIV-1 high-prevalent province in China, including Guangxi, Sichuan, Xijiang, Guangdong and Hennan [22], [23]. The early reports on characterization of HIV-1 genotypes in Yunnan were confined to the IDU population, which revealed multiple HIV-1 genotypes, including B, Bβ€™, C, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and URF [2], [3], [5], [9], [11], [16], [17], [24]. During the transition of main transmission route from intravenous injection to sexual contact, diverse HIV-1 strains were also identified among individuals who acquired HIV-1 through sexual contact [15], [16], [24]. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis showed that sequences from IDUs intermingled with those from individuals infected through sexual contact within each subtype of HIV-1 [24], which suggested HIV-1 strains circulating in the sexually transmitted population might come from those in IDUs through commercial or non commercial sex contacts.
In the early 2000s, CRF08_BC and CRF01_AE were dominant in IDUs and those with sexually transmitted infections, respectively [1], [16]. At that time, it was presumed that the prevalence of CRF01_AE would increase with sexual transmission rising [16]. However, in recently infected people, we found that CRF08_BC predominated not only in IDUs, but also in the heterosexually transmitted population. The influx of CRF08_BC into the heterosexually transmitted population may occur through male IDUs who visit female sex workers (FSWs) as well as FSWs who inject drugs. These groups have played a crucial role in the transition of the epidemic from being primarily IDU-driven to sexually driven [25]. Another possible reason is the transmission from HIV-1 positive IDUs to their spouses and regular sexual partners through unprotected sex. Furthermore, the distributions of the main HIV-1 genetic strains showed no statistical differences between IDUs and the heterosexually transmitted population. This suggests that these strains tended to randomly distribute into these two populations, and the phenomenon observed in previous studies [15], [16] of different subtypes/CRF predominating in different risk groups appears to have diminished. The changing characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology suggest that the bridging population is still the primary force behind the development of the HIV-1 epidemic in Yunnan. Thus, measures for effective epidemic control should be further developed and performed among the high-risk groups, particularly IDUs, commercial sex workers and the spouses of HIV-1 positive individuals. Key strategies should include behavior intervention, scaling up identification of HIV-1 infected persons among the high risk groups, and providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to them to effectively reduce HIV-1 incidence by decreasing the viral load level.
Recombination between HIV-1 genotypes is an important mechanism that contributes substantially to the genetic complexity of HIV-1 and may result in establishing epidemiologically important founder strains. The coexistence of multiple genotypes in the same area always causes the formation of CRFs. Typically, CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC have been thought to originate among IDUs in Yunnan [11], [12], but how this occurred was not well-understood. This past lack of knowledge may have been the result of the use of the env region only in earlier studies [2], [6]. CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC are composed mostly of subtype C and contain a few small segments of subtype Bβ€™. Thus, distinguishing between CRF07_BC/CRF08_BC and subtype C based on the env region alone would have been difficult. It has been reported that the nearly full-length genome analyses of the env-based subtype C samples revealed that they were actually BC recombinants [11]. In this study, we found two discrete BC clusters. The sequences in these two clades also clustered together with those of the BC recombinants detected in western Yunnan in the late 1990s and early 2000s [11], [17]. Furthermore, each cluster has its own recombination pattern in gag region, which is distinct from those of CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC. All of this suggests that new CRFs_BC might have been established in this area. To prove this hypothesis, the complete sequencing of full-length HIV-1 genomes is required in future research.
Besides CRFs, another striking result is that diverse URFs arise continually. URFs reported before mainly included new BC recombinants, CRF07_BC/CRF08_BC recombinants, and C/CRF01_AE recombinants [11], [16], [17], [26], [27], [28], [29], most of which were found among IDUs. In this work, we found that the types and quantity of URFs increased among recent infections. The frequency of URFs was exceeded only by that of CRF08_BC. Of the seven types of URFs detected, nearly 70% were identified among heterosexually-infected individuals, and 55.5% were CRF01_AE relative URFs. In Yunnan, CRF01_AE was first found among FSWs [7], and was the preponderant strain in this population in the early stage of the HIV-1 epidemic [1], [16]. The high proportion of CRF01_AE relative URFs suggests that active recombination took place through commercial sex behavior. The geographic distribution of URFs is growing and covered 12 out of the 16 prefectures. All of these contributed substantially to the genetic complexity of HIV-1 in Yunnan. The formation and linkage of these URFs will be our research focus in the future, which will elucidate the development of the HIV-1 epidemic of Yunnan, and provide references for HIV control in this area.
Furthermore, the HIV-1 strains showed different temporal and spatial dynamics in the process of spreading. We found that CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC were both highly prevalent in east Yunnan, but CRF08_BC was distributed more widely than CRF07_BC, covering almost the entire province. Presently, we do not know whether the transmission capacities of these two CRFs differ. CRF01_AE spread to east Yunnan, particularly in Kunming where the proportion of CRF01_AE remained at a low level in the early 2000s [30]. Thus, a general trend was that HIV-1 strains transferred from their original highly-prevalent area to the rest of the province. The specificity and dynamics of HIV-1 transmission also resulted in the different distribution of HIV-1 genotypes in different areas. For example, Dehong and Honghe showed the most complicated HIV-1 genetic diversity in the east and the west, respectively. However, their distribution patterns were totally different. CRF08_BC was predominant in Honghe, while BC recombinants and subtype C mainly circulated in Dehong. On the other hand, the neighboring prefectures shared similar distribution patterns, such as Honghe and Wenshan, Yuxi and Chuxiong, Dali and Lincang.
Since the first acknowledged HIV-1 epidemic in China began in Yunnan, this region has become a critical area bridging HIV-1 epidemics in southeast Asia with the subsequent inland epidemic. Through durg trafficking, some genotypes originally found in Yunnan had spread not just to the neighboring provinces of Guangxi (CRF08_BC) [12], [31], [32], [33], [34] and Sichuan (CRF07_BC) [35], but also to the north-western province of Xijiang (CRF07_BC) [12], [35] and the central province of Henan (subtype Bβ€™) [36]. On the other hand, the countries bordering Yunnan display their own characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology. In Vietnam, CRF01_AE is the predominant strain [37]. However, in Myanmar, besides Bβ€™, C and CRF01_AE, recombinant forms between Bβ€™, C and CRF01_AE are increasing dramatically [38]. A similar trend is seen in Dehong, where the proportion of URFs is higher than any other subtype/CRF. These suggest that the China-Myanmar border area constitutes a hot spot of active recombination in Asia. The bidirectional transmission of HIV-1 between Yunnan and neighboring countries means that the epidemic of Yunnan could potentially influence neighboring countries. All of this suggests that the main strains prevailing in China and neighboring countries could be found in Yunnan. Thus, comprehensively understanding HIV-1 molecular epidemical characteristics in Yunnan plays an important role in efficient control of the HIV-1 epidemic, as well as vaccine design and evaluation for China and the neighboring countries.
One limitation of this work was the relatively low PCR amplification rate (gag: 39.0%, 120/308; env: 35.1%, 108/308), which also occurrd in our previous work [16]. The reasons may be RNA degradation owing to poor serum storage and transportation conditions. In fact, the plasma specimens had been used for HIV-1 screening, confirmation and BED-CEIA before genetic analysis was performed, during which time the samples underwent several freeze-thaw cycles. Other reasons may include low viral load in some cases and sequence variations at the primer binding sites. The low amplification rate meant that some low-frequent viral genotype might be missed, however it is unlikely to compromise the interpretation of the general genetic distribution. This is because the constituent ratios of the 130 subjects with definite genotyping and the total of 308 recently HIV-infected individuals showed no statistical differences by area of source, gender, age, ethnicity, marital status and infection routes.
In summary, we found that six HIV-1 genotypes circulated in the recently infected individuals of Yunnan, and the distribution of the main genotypes was not closely associated with transmission route. HIV-1 genetics became more diverse because of frequent intersubtypes/CRFs recombinations. These findings showed new trends of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology with dynamic changes in the HIV-1 epidemic and will contribute to a better understanding of the distribution and evolution of HIV-1 in Yunnan as well as help to establish and modify public health efforts to prevent new infections.
