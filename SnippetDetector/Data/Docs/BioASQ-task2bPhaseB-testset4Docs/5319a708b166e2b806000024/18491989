BACKGROUND: The ubiquitin-proteasome system has become a promising novel molecular target in cancer due to its critical role in cellular protein degradation, its interaction with cell cycle and apoptosis regulation and its unique mechanism of action. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses both on preclinical results and on data from clinical trials with proteasome inhibitors in cancer. METHODS: Results in hematological malignancies and solid tumors were included, and important data presented in abstract form were considered in this review. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Bortezomib as first-in-class proteasome inhibitor has proven to be highly effective in some hematological malignancies, overcomes conventional chemoresistance, directly induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and also targets the tumor microenvironment. It has been granted approval by the FDA for relapsed multiple myeloma, and recently for relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. Combination chemotherapy regimens have been developed providing high remission rates and remission quality in frontline treatment or in the relapsed setting in multiple myeloma. The combination of proteasome inhibition with novel targeted therapies is an emerging field in oncology. Moreover, novel proteasome inhibitors, such as NPI-0052 and carfilzomib, have been developed. This review summarizes our knowledge of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and recent data from cancer clinical trials.
