The increasing appreciation of the importance of autophagy as consequence of cancer therapy or underlying disease biology is illustrated by the large number of papers that are evaluating autophagy as a cancer target. While autophagy is often linked to the generation of metabolic precursors, it is also important in diseases where protein production is a hallmark of the disease itself, such as pancreatic cancer and multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by ongoing autophagy as a consequence of constitutive immunoglobulin production, which creates the need for efficient transfer and disposal of misfolded or unfolded proteins. In order to survive this cellular stress, plasma cells depend on proteasomal degradation of the large volume of misfolded proteins as well as the autophagy pathway. It has previously been suggested that the excess proteins not targeted to the proteasome, or that accumulate when the proteasome is inhibited through the use of chemically active agents such as bortezomib, are linked to impaired cell survival, and that their packaging in the form of an aggresome somehow minimizes their 'proteotoxicity' allowing these toxic proteins to be sequestered away from normal cellular machinery.
