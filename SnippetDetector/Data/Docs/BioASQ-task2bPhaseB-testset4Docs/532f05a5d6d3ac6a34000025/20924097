PURPOSE: Ranolazine is a novel antianginal medication that acts by ameliorating disturbed sodium and calcium homeostasis. By preventing myocyte sodium and calcium overload, ranolazine also have potential beneficial effects on myocardial function. Experimental models support this concept, as do 2 small studies in human participants receiving ranolazine intravenously. We evaluated changes in parameters of left ventricular function in stable angina patients treated with oral ranolazine. METHODS: Twenty-two participants were enrolled with Doppler echocardiography performed at baseline and a mean of 2 months after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Global left ventricular function, as assessed by the myocardial performance index, was significantly improved on drug therapy (P < .0001). This was due to improvement in both diastolic and systolic parameters. Of 21 patients, 17 reported less angina and 8 patients reported an increase in activity level. CONCLUSIONS: We report improved parameters of left ventricular function in response to ranolazine as used in the clinical setting.
