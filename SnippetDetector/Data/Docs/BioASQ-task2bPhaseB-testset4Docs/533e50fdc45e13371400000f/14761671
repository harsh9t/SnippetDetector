The molecular events occurring after cerebral ischemia in hypertension may include de novo expression of numerous genes. Receptor genes are predominantly involved in the process of cell death, neuroprotection and reconstruction after ischemic injury. Ischemic stroke was observed in the non-genetic, non-surgical model of hypertension, the cold-induced hypertensive rat. In hypertensive rats suppression subtractive hybridization analysis was used to identify differentially expressed receptor genes in stroke-tissue compared to normal rat brain. We found 76 genes predominantly expressed in hypertensive rat stroke-tissue. These predominantly expressed genes included genes involved in energy metabolism, signal transduction/cell regulation, and replication/transcription/translation. For example, the T3 receptor alpha was predominantly expressed in stroke-tissue, indicating that regeneration of nerves in stroke tissue may be facilitated by increased T3 receptor alpha expression.
