UNLABELLED: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80% of all lung cancers. Although activating mutations in genes of the RAS-MAPK pathway occur in up to 30% of all NSCLC, the cooperating genetic lesions that are required for lung cancer initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Here we identify a role for the cell polarity regulator Scribble (Scrib) in NSCLC. A survey of genomic databases reveals deregulation of SCRIB in human lung cancer and we show that Scrib(+/-) mutant mice develop lung cancer by 540 days with a penetrance of 43%. To model NSCLC development in vivo, we used the extensively characterized LSL-KRas(G12D) murine model of NSCLC. We show that loss of Scrib and activated oncogenic KRas cooperate in vivo, resulting in more aggressive lung tumors, likely due to a synergistic elevation in RAS-MAPK signaling. Finally, we provide data consistent with immune infiltration having an important role in the acceleration of tumorigenesis in KRas(G12D) lung tumors following Scrib loss.Oncogene advance online publication, 25 November 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.498.
