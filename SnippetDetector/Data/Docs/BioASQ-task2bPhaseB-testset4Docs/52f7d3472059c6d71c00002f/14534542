Ras proteins control signaling pathways that are key regulators of several aspects of normal cell growth and malignant transformation. BRAF, which encodes a RAF family member in the downstream pathway of RAS, is somatically mutated in a number of human cancers. The activating mutation of BRAF is known to play a role in tumor development. As there have been no data on the BRAF mutation in stomach cancer, we analysed the genomic DNAs from 319 stomach carcinomas for the detection of somatic mutations of BRAF. Overall, we detected BRAF mutations in seven stomach carcinomas (2.2%). Five of the seven BRAF mutations involved Val 599, the previously identified hotspot, but the substituted amino acid (V599 M) was different from the most common BRAF mutation (V599E). The remaining two mutations involved a conserved amino acid (D593G). One tumor had both BRAF and KRAS mutations. This is the first report on BRAF mutation in stomach cancer, and the data indicate that BRAF is occasionally mutated in stomach cancer, and suggest that alterations of RAS pathway both by RAS and BRAF mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of stomach cancer.
