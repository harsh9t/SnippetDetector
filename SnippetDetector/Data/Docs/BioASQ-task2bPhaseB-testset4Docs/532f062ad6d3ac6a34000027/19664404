Ivabradine is an I(f) current inhibitor, that has documented antianginal efficacy. The BEAUTIFUL trial tested ivabradine against placebo in a large population of 10,917 patients in sinus rhythm, with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%. Overall, there was no impact of ivabradine on the primary end-point of the trial (cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for myocardial infarction, new onset or worsening heart failure). In the placebo arm of the trial, baseline heart rate > or = 70 bpm was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure and coronary revascularisation. In the subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate > or =70 bpm, treatment with ivabradine resulted in a significant, 36% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and a 20% reduction in the need for coronary revascularisation. Ivabradine was well tolerated, with an increased rate of treatment discontinuation, mainly due to bradycardia, compared with placebo. Because of its safety and efficacy to control angina, ivabradine should be considered first-line antianginal treatment in coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction and increased heart rate, already receiving beta-blocker therapy or in whom these medications are not tolerated.
