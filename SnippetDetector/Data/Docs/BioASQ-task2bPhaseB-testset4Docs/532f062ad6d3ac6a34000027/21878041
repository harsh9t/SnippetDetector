Heart rate is a major determinant of myocardial oxygen demand and supply, and increased heart rate adversely affects the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia. High resting heart rate is a risk factor in cardiovascular disease. The development of the heart rate-lowering agent ivabradine showed that heart rate was also an important treatment target, notably in coronary artery disease and heart failure. Indeed, heart rate reduction with ivabradine, a selective and specific I(f) inhibitor, reduces myocardial oxygen demand, increases diastolic perfusion time and improves energetics in ischemic myocardium. Ivabradine protects the myocardium during ischemia, improves left ventricular function in heart failure and reduces remodeling following myocardial infarction. It improves prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and heart rate â‰¥70 beats per minute, as well as in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. Ivabradine is safe, well tolerated and can be used in combination with the main drugs for cardiovascular disease.
