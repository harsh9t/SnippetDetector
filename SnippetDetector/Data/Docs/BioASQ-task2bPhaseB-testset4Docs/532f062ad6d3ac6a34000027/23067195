The SHIFT study showed a positive effect of ivabradine in patients with chronic heart failure, sinus rhythm and heart rate at rest above 70 beats per minute. The aim of the first sub-study was to ascertain the effect of ivabradine on changes to the left ventricle function using echocardiography; ivabradine significantly increased ejection fraction of the left ventricle and reduced terminal left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes. The second sub-study explored changes to the quality of life in patients treated with ivabradine or placebo. This study also showed statistically significantly improved quality of life after treatment with ivabradine. Both sub-studies confirmed the positive effect of ivabradine on patients with optimal treatment of heart failure, including maximum tolerated dose of beta-blockers and sinus heart rate above 70/min.
