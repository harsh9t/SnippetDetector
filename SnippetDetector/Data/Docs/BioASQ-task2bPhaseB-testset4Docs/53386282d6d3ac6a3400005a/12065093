Pancreatic cancers frequently have defects in components of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway. TIEG1 (TGF-beta inducible early gene) is a recently characterized transcription factor regulated by TGF-beta that induces apoptosis when overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Alterations on chromosome 8q, where TIEG1 is located, are also relatively frequent in pancreatic cancers. To determine if TIEG1 may be involved in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer, we performed mutational screening of this gene in 22 pancreatic cancer cell lines. No sequence alterations were observed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis was also performed to rule out the possibility that the expression of the gene is altered by genetic events other than mutation. Likewise, no alterations in expression were found. Thus, an essential role of TIEG1 in pancreatic cancer can be excluded.
