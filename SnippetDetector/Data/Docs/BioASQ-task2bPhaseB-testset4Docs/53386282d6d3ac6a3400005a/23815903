This study was aimed to investigate the influence of TIEG1 on apoptosis of HL-60 cells and the expression of Bcl-2/Bax. Different concentration of TIEG1 were used to treat HL-60 cells, the cell growth inhibition rate was detected by MTT method. After treating HL-60 cells with 12.03 ng/ml TIEG1, cell apoptosis was detected with flow cytometry. Bcl-2 and Bax was detected with RT-PCR. The results showed that TIEG1 had inhibitory effect on HL-60 cell proliferation, and in time-and dose-dependent manners. The more obvious inhibitory effect was observed in HL-60 cells treated with TIEG1 of 12.03 ng/ml. During the course of cell apoptosis, Bax expression increased, but Bcl-2 expression decreased (P < 0.05). It is concluded that TIEG1 inhibits HL-60 cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in time and dose-dependent manners. During the course of HL-60 cells apoptosis induced by TIEG1, Bcl-2/Bax are associated with HL-60 cell apoptosis induced by TIEG1.
