Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays an important role during the period of developmental cell death in the nervous system. Using the oligodendroglial precursor cell line OLI-neu, we have previously established an in vitro system to analyze TGF-beta-mediated cell death on the molecular level. We could show that the Kr√ºppel-like Zn-finger transcription factor TIEG1 was up-regulated after TGF-beta stimulation of OLI-neu cells and mimicked TGF-beta effects in these cells; i.e., overexpression of TIEG1 in OLI-neu cells induced apoptosis as shown by apoptosis ELISA, DNA fragmentation, and caspases-3 activation. The apoptotic pathway seemed to be initiated by repressing the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL. In contrast, the reporter activity of a SMAD consensus promoter was induced, whereas the promoter activity of the inhibitory SMAD7 was reduced, suggesting that SMAD-dependent TGF-beta responses, such as TGF-beta-induced apoptosis, are enhanced in the presence of TIEG1.
