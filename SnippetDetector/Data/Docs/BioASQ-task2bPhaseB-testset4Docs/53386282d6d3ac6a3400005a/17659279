Overexpression of TGFbeta inducible early gene (TIEG1) mimics TGFbeta action and induces apoptosis. In this study, we found that TIEG1 was significantly up-regulated during apoptosis induced by homoharringtonine or velcade. Overexpression of TIEG1 could induce apoptosis in K562 cells and promote apoptosis induced by HHT or velcade. TIEG1-induced apoptosis was shown to involve Bax and Bim up-regulation, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL down-regulation, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, activation of caspase 3 and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). We concluded that TIEG1 is a key regulator which induces and promotes apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
