TGF-beta-induced apoptosis is essential for embryonic development and mainteanance of adult tissues. Impairment of the apoptotic pathway, regulated by TGF-beta, plays a center role in tumorigenesis and manifestations of different diseases. TIEG2/KLF11 is a recently identified human TGF-beta-inducible zinc finger protein belonging to the family of Sp1/KLF-like transcription factors. In human and murine tissues it has been shown that TIEG1 and TIEG2 induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth. Since TGF-beta and Tieg1 are able to induce apoptosis in the oligodendroglial cell line OLI-neu, we analysed the ability of TIEG2 to mimic the effects observed after treatment with TGF-beta and overexpression of Tieg1. Herein we report that TIEG2 induces Caspase3-dependent apoptosis in murine OLI-neu cells. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that TIEG2 decreases the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L) and inhibits transcription driven by the Bcl-X(L) promoter. These data suggest that TIEG2 serves as a downstream mediator of TGF-beta, bridging TGF-beta-dependent signaling to the intracellular pathway of apoptosis.
