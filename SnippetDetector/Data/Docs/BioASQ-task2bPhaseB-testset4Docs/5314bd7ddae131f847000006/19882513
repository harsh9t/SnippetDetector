PURPOSE: Leprechaunism is a rare congenital syndrome caused by mutations of the insulin receptor gene, transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) treatment can be a therapeutic option in this syndrome by its insulin-like effects. Nevertheless, it is of note that IGF-1 has also an angiogenic activity. METHODS: Fundus examination by ophthalmoscopy, fluorangiography, and laser treatment were performed. RESULTS: A 17-year-old girl with leprechaunism, under treatment with high doses of insulin, presented a florid diabetic retinopathy. The large neovascularization of the disk regressed after treatment with argon laser panretinal photocoagulation. Five years after treatment, the patient maintained good vision. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case is of interest for 2 reasons: 1) the large retinal neovascularization was likely due to the high insulin dosages; 2) this is the first case in which a sustained regression of retinal neovascularization has been observed after laser treatment in leprechaunism.
