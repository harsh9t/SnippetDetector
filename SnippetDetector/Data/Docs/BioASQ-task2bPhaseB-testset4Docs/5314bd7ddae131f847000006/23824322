Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS). At presentation, DS and RMS are difficult to differentiate since they share many clinical features; however, while patients with DS usually die within 1 year of birth, individuals classified as RMS can reach adult age. INSR mutations can be also found in pubertal females with hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans (type A SIR). We studied the INSR gene in five subjects with congenital SIR and in a patient with type A SIR. Nine biallelic INSR gene mutations (eight novels, including an in-frame deletion of INSR signal peptide) were identified in patients with congenital SIR; a heterozygous, spontaneous INSR mutation was detected in the patient with type A SIR. Two probands, presenting severe hirsutism at birth, died at the age of 3 months and were classified as DS, while other 2, currently 2 and 3 years old, were diagnosed with RMS (patients 3 and 4). The fifth patient with congenital SIR died when 14 months old. Nephrocalcinosis, hyperaldosteronism, hyperreninemia, and hypokalemia, in the absence of hypertension, were discovered in patients 3 and 5 when 24 and 4 months old, respectively. Patient 3, now 3 years/3 months old, still shows hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism requiring potassium supplementation. We conclude that renal abnormalities resembling antenatal Bartter's syndrome type II, recently reported also by others, is a common observation in patients with congenital SIR.
