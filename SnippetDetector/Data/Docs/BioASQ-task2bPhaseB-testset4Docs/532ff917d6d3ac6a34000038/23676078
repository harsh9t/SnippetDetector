<abstract>
BACKGROUND: Zebrafish embryos are transcriptionally silent until activation of the zygotic genome during the 10th cell cycle. Onset of transcription is followed by cellular and morphological changes involving cell speciation and gastrulation. Previous genome-wide surveys of transcriptional changes only assessed gene expression levels; however, recent studies have shown the necessity to map isoform-specific transcriptional changes. Here, we perform isoform discovery and quantification on transcriptome sequences from before and after zebrafish zygotic genome activation (ZGA). RESULTS: We identify novel isoforms and isoform switches during ZGA for genes related to cell adhesion, pluripotency and DNA methylation. Isoform switching events include alternative splicing and changes in transcriptional start sites and in 3' untranslated regions. New isoforms are identified even for well-characterized genes such as pou5f1, sall4 and dnmt1. Genes involved in cell-cell interactions such as f11r and magi1 display isoform switches with alterations of coding sequences. We also detect over 1000 transcripts that acquire a longer 3' terminal exon when transcribed by the zygote compared to their maternal transcript counterparts. ChIP-sequencing data mapped onto skipped exon events reveal a correlation between histone H3K36 trimethylation peaks and skipped exons, suggesting epigenetic marks being part of alternative splicing regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The novel isoforms and isoform switches reported here include regulators of transcriptional, cellular and morphological changes taking place around ZGA. Our data display an array of isoform-related functional changes and represent a valuable resource complementary to existing early embryo transcriptomes.

Background
uring the first ten cell cycles after fertilization, the zebrafish embryo is
transcriptionally silent and consists of undifferentiated and rapidly dividing
blastomeres [1]. nitiation of transcription at the 10th cell cycle is termed
zygotic genome activation (). t the time of , development proceeds from a control
by m. RNAs synthesized during oogenesis and stored in the egg (maternal transcripts) to
mRNAs produced by the embryoβ€™s own genome. Following ZGA, blastomeres divide less
frequently and more asynchronously, they start to differentiate and migrate to form the
three germ layers of the gastrulating embryo [1-4]. Collectively, these transformations characterize the mid-blastula transition
(MBT). These fundamental cellular and functional changes occurring during development
make zebrafish an attractive model to study transcriptional changes governing between
pre-MBT and post-MBT development.
Previous studies have shown essential roles of activation and degradation of maternal
transcripts in regulating the MBT and ZGA [5-7]. Signaling pathways involving Bmp, Nodal, Fgf, Wnt and maternal
Ξ²-catenin are essential for the formation of germ layers and body axis [8]. We and others have shown that the establishment of post-translationally
modified histones on specific genomic sites and DNA methylation play a role in
transcriptional regulation around the time of ZGA by patterning developmental gene
expression [9-12]. However, although several early transcriptomes have recently been published [5,13,14], little is known on the isoform-specific dynamics governing developmental
transitions around the MBT.
The notion that each gene can give rise to multiple mRNAs has evolved from being
reported as a rare phenomenon [15,16] to include virtually all loci in man [17,18], and has been shown to be crucial for differentiation [19], development [20] and human disease [21]. Isoform switches, defined as a change in the isoform composition of gene
products between two conditions (e.g. two developmental stages) are of particular
interest since such events are critical for differentiation [19]. The differences between transcript isoforms can affect the coding sequence
(CDS) and/or untranslated regions (UTRs) 3' or 5' of the CDS. The former is likely to
affect protein function, while the latter may affect translational efficiency, mRNA
degradation kinetics and spatial distribution of transcripts [22,23]. The mechanisms regulating splicing and determining the production of
specific transcript isoforms have started to be unveiled and involve
cis-elements and trans-acting factors, as well as epigenetic
modifications in the proximity of spliced exons [24-26]. A genome-wide landscape of transcript isoforms synthesized during early
development, and particularly of the switches occurring between maternal and zygotic
isoforms at the time the embryo initiates its own transcriptional program, has been
lacking and has hampered a comprehensive appreciation of the transcriptional dynamics
occurring at the time of ZGA.
We have used an isoform prediction and quantification program, Cufflinks [27], to detect novel isoforms and quantify isoform-specific changes from
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads before and after ZGA in zebrafish. We identify numerous
novel isoforms related to shifts in transcription start site (TSS), alternative splicing
(AS) events and transcription termination sites (TTS), when comparing transcripts of
maternal and zygotic origin coming from the same gene. These include transcripts of
genes involved in cell-cell interactions, pluripotency control and DNA methylation.
Using H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation (me3) data acquired by chromatin immunoprecipitation
and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we find that H3K4me3 can form relatively
broad domains which cannot distinguish between closely spaced alternative TSSs, unless
TSSs are linked to alternative promoters at distant locations. Skipped exons are
enriched in H3K36me3 and H3K4me3, extending previous reports on the involvement of these
histone modifications in the regulation of isoform usage.

Results and discussion
apping of -seq reads achieved from combined use of two aligners. Using two different short RNA-seq read aligning programs, namely Bioscope (Life
Technologies, USA, Carlsbad, CA) and TopHat [28], we remapped all reads generated by RNA-seq in a recently published study [5]. This β€�two alignerβ€™ approach yields a higher number of mapped
reads than each aligner alone and proves to be complementary compared to using either
aligner separately (Figure S1 and S2 in Additional file 1).
From our RNA-seq data, four datasets from pre-ZGA zebrafish developmental stages
(pre-MBT) and two from post-ZGA stages (post-MBT) were merged, respectively
generating one maternal transcriptome dataset, and one combined late maternal-early
zygotic (henceforth termed zygotic) dataset (FigureΒ 1).
This strategy yields an opportunity to examine the embryonic transcriptome before and
after ZGA, and provides more sequencing depth and thus higher accuracy in
constructing transcripts. A total of 71.5 and 49 million RNA-seq reads were thus
mapped from the pre-MBT and post-MBT developmental stages, respectively.Figure 1Transcript isoform analysis pipeline. Mapped reads from the egg and
three pre-MBT samples (1-cell, 16-cell and 256-cell) were merged to represent
the maternal transcriptome. This period is characterized by absence of
transcription and pluripotent blastomeres. Two samples were merged to represent
the first zygotic transcriptome, representing the embryo when cells start to
differentiate and transcription has begun. The RNA-seq reads were mapped using
two different aligners (Tophat and Bioscope) and Cufflinks was used to
construct transcriptomes guided by Ensembl annotation. This resulted in a
complete gene annotation set (β€�allβ€™) comprising both expressed and
non-expressed genes and one dataset with robust >3 FPKM level of expression
(FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3). Embryo illustrations are from Kimmel et al. (1995).Transcriptome assembly identifies novel genes and isoformsWe used the Cufflinks software and associated tools [27,29] to assemble transcriptomes based on the mapped reads (FigureΒ 1). Cufflinks was run in Reference Annotation Based Transcript
assembly (RABT)-mode [30], using annotations from Ensembl as a guide (Zv9, version 64). We created
two datasets. i) A set of all Ensembl annotations and all transcripts assembled was
generated, referred to as the β€�allβ€™ gene annotation; this set contains
89,368 transcripts from 41,583 genes (Additional file 2).
ii) Expression values were obtained for the β€�allβ€™ dataset (Additional
file 3) and these were used to filter the β€�allβ€™
gene annotation to generate a file of robustly expressed transcripts, defined as
fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments with a value >3
(FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3) (Additional file 4). This dataset
contains 26,117 isoforms from 14,380 genes (FigureΒ 1). Of
these transcripts, the vast majority (22,600) have multiple exons (FigureΒ 2a). These multiple-exon transcripts arise from 10,863 genes
(FigureΒ 2a), thus multi-exon loci produce on average
nearly 2 isoforms. Altogether, we identify 22,453 TSSs (FigureΒ 2b) and 20,562 transcription termination sites (TTSs) in the
FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3 gene annotation dataset (FigureΒ 2c).
This indicates that a large fraction of the isoforms arise from differential use of
TSSs or TTSs. However, the fact that isoforms from the same locus with different TSSs
also frequently differ in their exon content is a reflection of Cufflinksβ€™
parsimonious nature, because Cufflinks proposes as few transcript models as necessary
to explain the aligned reads [27].Figure 2Characterization of the pre-ZGA and post-ZGA embryo transcriptomes.
(a) Number of genes, transcripts and transcripts with one or more
exons in the all and FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3 datasets. (b) Percentages of
loci with 1, 2, 3 or more TSSs. (c) Percentages of loci with 1, 2, 3 or
more TTSs. (d) Percentage of isoforms classified as NTR, identical
(known) or new in the FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3 dataset. (e) Difference
between the novel and annotated transcripts on functional domain(s) content.
Most novel isoforms had retained all functional domains as compared to their
closest matching annotated counterpart.To identify novel isoforms and genes, the predicted isoforms in the
FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3 dataset were compared to Ensembl annotations (Zv9, version 64).
This classifies 8,108 of the transcripts as identical, 12,100 as new isoforms, and
4,174 as novel transcribed regions (NTRs) i.e. possibly novel genes
(FigureΒ 2d). This analysis indicates that the assembled
zebrafish transcriptome contains numerous novel transcripts, some of which may be
encoded by novel genes.Functional differences between annotated and novel transcriptsThe large number of novel isoforms warranted further validation and characterization.
We investigated the coding potential of new isoforms and found that nearly all have
an open reading frame (ORF) (11,627/12,100; 96%) of >50 amino acids in length
(starting with an AUG start codon and ending with a stop codon). Increasing the ORF
length requirement results in a slight decrease in the number of ORFs detected (100
amino acids, 89%; 150 amino acids, 81%).We then compared both the transcript sequence and the inferred coding sequence
between novel isoforms and their closest matching annotated transcript from the same
locus (as defined by Cufflinks). On average, the novel isoforms have shorter coding
sequences than the corresponding annotated coding sequences with a mean difference of
β�’230Β bp (median β�’109Β bp). Of 11,529 comparisons, 1,695 of the
novel isoforms differ by one amino acid or less, indicating identical coding
sequences (this corresponds to 15% of the transcripts with an ORF of β‰¥50 amino
acids). Transcript isoforms with no difference in coding sequences length have on
average longer 5β€™ and/or 3β€™ UTRs, with a mean length difference of
549Β bp (median 256Β bp). Therefore, the novel isoforms can be broadly
divided into two groups, those with no change in coding sequence length but with
longer 5β€™ and/or 3β€™ UTR, and those with an alteration in coding sequence
length.We next examined any functional effect these transcript isoforms may have, and used
the predicted protein sequences for a domain scan using Pfam, a database of protein
families [31]. The detection of a protein domain has been shown to be suggestive of
protein functionality [32]. Of the novel isoforms analyzed, 8,949 (74%) contain a sequence with high
similarity to an identified protein domain. In comparison, the closest matching
annotated transcripts (nβ€‰=β€‰5,908) have a substantially larger fraction of
Pfam domain-containing sequences (5,196; 88%). Further, most of the novel isoforms
encode the same functional domains as the annotated isoforms (FigureΒ 2e). However, a substantial fraction loses either all functional
domains (nβ€‰=β€‰1971), or some of them (nβ€‰=β€‰2017;
FigureΒ 2e). Also, a small subgroup
(nβ€‰=β€‰123) of the novel isoforms contains functional domains absent from
the annotated isoform (FigureΒ 2e). Taken together, these
results suggest that the majority of the novel transcript isoforms are functional,
with roles related to their annotated counterparts. However, some lose or gain
functional domains, suggesting that they might exhibit different biological
functions.TSS usage and switchingTranscription is initiated at TSSs and differential usage of TSSs is often associated
with tissue-specific expression or distinct protein products [33]. Using Cufflinks, we identify 513 loci (q-valueβ€‰<β€‰0.001;
Additional file 5) with a change in TSS usage between pre-
and post-ZGA stages. A typical example is the isoforms of dazl encoding an
RNA-binding protein crucial for germ cell development, oocyte-to-zygote transition
and maintenance of pluripotency [34-36]. The biological function of the Dazl protein is at the level of regulation
of translation [37] and recent experiments indicate that Dazl protects transcripts from
degradation, possibly through antagonizing the de-adenylating effect of miRNAs [38]. Our data show that the transcript isoforms of dazl are expressed
from at least two promoters maternally (FigureΒ 3a;
promoter 1β€‰=β€‰grey arrow 1 (most upstream); promoter 2β€‰=β€‰grey
arrows 2 and 3, black arrows in the top panel point towards reads supporting
expression from both TSSs pre-ZGA). In the post-ZGA transcriptome, the lack of reads
supporting usage of promoter 1 (FigureΒ 3a; white arrow,
bottom panel) demonstrates degradation of the maternal-specific 5β€™ distal
isoform during the MBT (FigureΒ 3a). RT-qPCR confirms the
trend observed by RNA-seq (Figure S3 in Additional file 1).
Both dazl isoforms are present in Ensembl (pre-ZGA: ENSDART00000147911;
post-ZGA: ENSDART00000137590). The CDS of the maternal-specific transcript displays a
17 amino acid shorter N-terminus compared to the zygotic transcript. However, the
functional implication of this difference is not straightforward because the
RNA-recognition motif of the Dazl protein is located 30 amino acids downstream and is
not affected, unless induced by configuration change. Considering the diverse and
temporarily restricted roles of Dazl in germ cell development and oocyte-to-zygote
transition [34,35], it is tempting to speculate that the maternal and zygotic isoforms may be
responsible for two biological processes: the β€�maternalβ€™ version may act
in the oocyte-to-zygote transition, whereas the zygotic variant may act in germ cell
development.Figure 3Dazl TSS switching and f11r exon
skipping switch. (a) A screenshot from Integrative Genomics
Viewer shows that dazl has been transcribed from at least two
TSSβ€™s in the maternal transcriptome; grey arrows 1β€“3 at bottom
indicate Ensembl annotated TSSs. Black arrows in the upper panel indicate reads
supporting promoter 1 (rightmost black arrow) and promoter 2/3 (leftmost black
arrow; our data cannot distinguish between TSS 2 and 3). A white arrow in the
upper panel points at a splice junction β€�bridgeβ€™ (red), symbolizing
the splice junction for the most distal first exon. The thickness of splice
junction symbols is correlated with the number of reads supporting the
junction. Post-ZGA transcripts lack the most 5β€™ exon as can be observed
from the absence of reads supporting the splice junction originating from this
exon (white arrow, bottom panel). (b) Pre-ZGA an f11r isoform
with exon 8 included is present (white arrow, top panel). Post-ZGA a different
f11r isoform, this one with exon 8 lacking, has been transcribed
(white arrow, bottom panel). (c) The f11r exon skipping (red
asterix) leads to a frame shift resulting in a 6 nt longer ORF, including the
removal of two C-terminal valine residues. Two functional domains,
immunoglobulin V-set domain (PF07686) and immunoglobulin domain (PF00047)
(white bars) are intact in both splice isoforms.Among the 513 genes which display a change in TSS pattern between the pre- and
post-ZGA, dazl represents a subset where the TSSs are defined by different
first exons. This type of TSS switch is likely to affect developmental functions as
illustrated with dazls changes in the 5β€™UTR and N-terminus of the
protein.Epigenetic regulation of TSS usage and expressionH3K4me3 enrichment over the TSS is considered as a histone modification associated
with transcription permissiveness. While virtually all expressed genes are marked by
H3K4me3 at the TSS [39,40], many genes that are not expressed also harbor H3K4me3 [9,41]. H3K27me3 promoter occupancy is on the other hand associated with
transcriptional repression [42]. To identify a relationship between TSS usage and potentially associated
chromatin marks, we used published ChIP-seq peak calling data for H3K4me3 and
H3K27me3 in post-MBT stage embryos [13], and investigated the correlation between these histone modifications and
the TSSs mapped in our study.We find that a subset of 22,534 TSSs from 13,542 genes from our β€�allβ€™
gene annotation dataset are enriched in H3K4me3. Most peaks (18,547/23,778; 78%) were
within Β±500Β bp of a gene. The number of TSSs in the dataset and the number
of peaks covering them indicates that multiple TSSs are included within each H3K4me3
peak, as exemplified by dazl and sall4 (Figure S4a,b in Additional
file 1). On rare occasions, we observe that H3K4me3 peaks
are located over the most frequently used TSS (major TSS) (e.g. actl6a;
Figure S4c in Additional file 1). Therefore, at present
H3K4me3 peaks cannot be used to predict the major TSS since the mark can overlap
multiple TSSs. More accurate determination of TSS usage, e.g. using approaches such
as cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) together with H3K4me3 enrichment data may
improve the usefulness of this histone modification in predicting major active start
sites among closely located TSSs.Our RNA-seq data show that 21% of the H3K4me3-marked genes are expressed at very low
levels, with 2,822 loci displaying an FPKM value below 1 in both pre- and post-ZGA
samples (Additional file 3). For the subgroup of
bidirectional promoters identified using the H3K4me3 peaks (nβ€‰=β€‰1,433
promoter pairs) (see Methods) we find no significant correlation in expression
between the bidirectional gene pairs (Pearsonβ€™s productβ€“moment
correlation <0.01), again supporting H3K4me3 as a mark for predisposition of
promoter activation rather than having a direct activating effect, even when
presumably sharing the same promoter. However, on average, H3K4me3-marked genes are
more strongly expressed than genes without H3K4me3, as described earlier for RefSeq
genes (data not shown) [10].An important question is whether epigenetic marks can regulate particular subgroups
of genes, functionally and spatially. To address the first question, analysis in
DAVID of gene ontology (GO) terms for biological functions were obtained using
H3K4me3- and H3K27me3-marked genes. This was significant only for one term for the
H3K4me3-marked genes; cell cycle (FDRβ€‰<β€‰0.001; Additional file 6). This is in contrast to H3K27me3-marked genes which were
enriched for 21 GO terms with the same cut off (i.e. regulation of transcription,
embryonic morphogenesis, pattern specification process and regionalization;
Additional file 7). Thus, whereas H3K4me3 mark TSSs of
genes linked to many biological functions, H3K27me3 marks mostly the TSSs of genes
involved in developmental functions. These results are consistent with a H3K4me3
pre-patterning of promoters of a specific subset of genes pre-MBT (involved in
housekeeping and homeostatic functions), and with a view of H3K27me3 repressing
developmental genes prior to their activation at or after the MBT [9,10].Another intriguing question is whether TSS marking with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
exists (so-called β€�bivalencyβ€™). We utilized the extensive annotation
database of where zebrafish genes are expressed anatomically (anatomical ontology
provided by the zebrafish model organism database; ZFIN [43]) to bring further clarity to this issue. H3K4me3-marked genes are mostly
expressed in the entire organism, in contrast to H3K27me3-marked genes which are
predominantly annotated with expression in distinct tissue types (in particular
central nervous system structures; Additional file 8 and
Additional file 9). This is consistent with H3K27me3
analysis of dissected Xenopus embryos [44], and not supportive of bivalency in zebrafish embryos, as others have
suggested [9].Taken together, our results show that during zebrafish development, H3K4me3 is a mark
of TSSs independent of transcription status. The marked genes show no pronounced
tissue-specific preferences and few specialized biological function as a group. In
contrast, H3K27me3 marked genes have specific biological functions and are expressed
in specialized cells. Our results are in line with the view that H3K4me3 contributes
to a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment for TSS usage; however, the
repressive marks seem to contribute to lineage commitment and tissue-specific
differentiation [45]. The use of ChIP-seq data and a comprehensive gene annotation based on
existing and novel annotations confirm the trends from previous studies based on
older annotation and ChIP-chip data [9,10].Shifts in alternative splicing during the switch from maternal to zygotic
transcriptsAlternative splicing (AS) allows the production of multiple mature mRNAs from the
same primary transcript, increasing genetic diversity of a genome by several-fold. We
used Cufflinks to identify shifts in AS isoform patterns before and after the ZGA. A
total of 2,160 primary transcripts exhibited a significant change in the splice
isoform composition (examples include foxh1, hdac5, dnmt3
and gsk3a; Additional file 10). Quality control
by visual inspection revealed mostly subtle changes among the significantly changing
primary transcripts. Importantly we find, also by visual inspection, that several
obvious isoform switches do not pass the significance criteria of Cufflinks. For
example, we report f11r, encoding a trans-membrane adhesion protein found in
association with tight junctions [46,47], which displays a switch between the maternal and zygotic stages, with
exon 8 skipped only in the zygotic transcripts (FigureΒ 3b). Using reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR, we validated the expression
pattern of f11r (Figure S5 in Additional file 1).
Exon 8 of f11r is only 13Β bp long and is included in the maternal
isoform of the f11r transcript (FigureΒ 3c, upper
panel). Skipping of exon 8, detected in the zygotic transcriptome (FigureΒ 3c, lower panel), causes a frame-shift with an alteration of the
C-terminal 36 amino acids; however two known functional domains in the F11r protein
are not directly affected, although indirect structural effects cannot be excluded
(FigureΒ 3c). The change in the intracellular C-terminal
portion of the protein includes the removal of two terminal valine residues which are
involved in binding to PDZ-domain containing proteins [46]. In zebrafish, interference with F11r function causes defects in migration
at later stages of development [48]. Interestingly, the shift in f11r isoform usage between pre- and
post-MBT stages coincides with the initiation of cell migration taking place after
the MBT [1,2]. It is tempting to speculate that attenuation of binding potential to PDZ
domain-containing proteins enables cells to alter their migration patterns [49,50]. However, functional studies are required to test this hypothesis.From our dataset, it appears therefore that thousands of splice isoform switches
occur between the maternal and zygotic transcriptomes; nonetheless, it is important
to emphasize that the majority constitutes subtle changes rather than obvious
functional on/off events.Quantification of AS eventsWe used the software ASTALAVISTA [51] to quantify the frequency of four different types of AS events; exon
skipping (ES), alternative donor (AD) and acceptor (AA) sites and intron retention
(IR) (FigureΒ 4a). Using the FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3
transcript subset, we identify a total of 10,950 AS events linked to 3,843 loci (36%
of the multi-exon loci). AA and AD sites make up 2,107 (19%) and 3,185 (29%) of these
events, respectively, and we find 852 IR and 4,806 ES occurrences (FigureΒ 4a). Noteworthy, only 39% of the ES events involve the skipping of
a single exon, while the majority of these events involve the skipping of β‰¥2
exons (61%).Figure 4Alternative splicing in the early embryo. (a) The frequency of 4
different alternative splicing events: Exon skipping (ES), alternative acceptor
site (AA), alternative donor site (AD) and intron retention (IR). ES is the
most frequent AS event. In most ES events multiple exons are skipped.
(b) Schematic representation of an annotated version (top) and a new
(bottom) isoform for dnmt1. Black lines between the isoforms represent
the conserved area. Functional domains (white bars) were defined by Pfam: DMAP1
binding domain (DMAP1-BD, PF06464), Cytosine specific methyltransferase
replication foci domain (Cyt MeTrfase1 RFD, PF12047), CXXC zinc finger domain
(β€�CXβ€�: Znf CXXC, PF02008), Bromo-adjacent homology domain (BAH,
PF01426), C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase domain (C5_ MeTfrase, PF00145).
In the new isoform 19 exons are skipped, and all functional domains except a
DMAP1 binding domain are lost. The novel isoform also have a longer 5β€™UTR
relative to the annotated version. (c) Novel pou5f1 isoforms.
The annotated version of pou5f1 has two Pfam domains; Homeobox domain
(HB, PF00046) and POU (PF00157). We identify 3 novel alternative acceptor sites
(arrows 1β€“3) all within the CDS of pou5f1. The first leads to a
3 nt deletion and removal of one glutamic acid, upstream of the POU; the second
a 19 nt insertion causing a frame shift and a truncated Pou5f1 protein with
both functional domains lost; the third event gives a 4 nt deletion which
truncates the HB. We also detect a longer 3β€™ UTR post-ZGA (arrow 4).An example of the latter includes dnmt1, encoding DNA methyltransferase 1
responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, particularly during
development (reviewed in [52]). dnmt1 has approximately 34 exons with three isoforms annotated
in zebrafish; however, our analysis detects several additional isoforms (Figure S6 in
Additional file 1). Cufflinks predicts 9 dnmt1
isoforms (FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3), but without full-length sequence data the number of
biologically relevant isoforms remains uncertain. One new isoform of dnmt1
is robustly expressed maternally (Additional file 3) and
truncated due to skipping of 19 exons (validated by cDNA cloning and sequencing; data
shown in Additional file 11). This skipping event removes
most of the functional domains involved in DNA methyltransferase activity, but it
retains a DMAP1 binding domain (FigureΒ 4b). This domain
binds the co-repressor DMAP1 and thereby confers DNMT1 with transcriptional repressor
activity [53,54]. Interestingly, in Xenopus it has been shown that Dnmt1 is needed
to repress transcription prior to the MBT [55] and this function does not rely on the cytosine methyltransferase
catalytic activity of Dnmt1 [56]. Zebrafish may therefore be a valuable candidate to shed more light on the
functional role of dnmt1 and its isoforms. The novel dnmt1 isoforms
discovered in this study may bring clarity to the enigmatic issue of transcriptional
repression during cleavage stages in zebrafish [11,57] and other species [58].For the pluripotency-associated gene pou5f1 (also known as oct4) we
identify several new splicing events, all of which were confirmed by cDNA cloning and
sequencing (sequences are shown in Additional file 12). In
zebrafish, there is only one annotated pou5f1 transcript, while in human
three arise from AS [59]. We observe novel pou5f1 AS events originating from alternative
acceptor sites at exons 2, 3 and 5 (FigureΒ 4c; Figure S7
in Additional file 1). The first event leads to deletion of
a nucleotide triplet coding for glutamic acid (validated by one cDNA clone sequence
out of 12 random clones analyzed), yet with no effect on the functional domains. The
removal of a charged amino acid is however likely to affect the three-dimensional
structure of Pou5f1, although functional consequences remain unknown at this stage.
The second AS event is located 19 nt prior to the annotated exon 3 (validated by one
cDNA clone sequence). This leads to a frame-shift and a truncated Pou5f1 protein,
removing both functional domains. Lastly, a 4 nt deletion causes a frame-shift in the
exon 5 (validated by 5 of 12 cDNA clones sequences, suggesting higher abundance of
this isoform) and leads to a truncation of the homeobox domain. Of note, we also find
novel isoforms for other genes important for pluripotency, such as klf4,
sall4 and nanog. This indicates that several well-studied genes
with central functions in pluripotency are still not fully annotated in zebrafish,
and highlights a likelihood of uncovering novel intricacies about pluripotency
control mechanisms.Epigenetic marks associated with exon skippingAS predominantly occurs co-transcriptionally, which may influence the regulation of
splicing by changes of epigenetic signatures such as histone modifications and DNA
methylation [24,25,60]. We used ChIP-seq to map H3K36me3 occupancy in post-ZGA embryos, and used
published peak calling data for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 [13] to investigate any association between these modified histones and single
ES events. We extracted the number of reads spanning each skipped exon (this is
direct evidence for skipping of an exon; see Methods); 1,668 single ES events have
one or more reads supporting the skipping event, of which most only with a few reads
spanning them. Focusing on 446 exons with >5 reads supporting the skipping of these
exons at the post-MBT stage, we examined peaks of H3K4, H3K27 and H3K36
trimethylation in their vicinity (see Methods). H3K36me3 peaks and skipped exons
co-localize in 194 of the 446 exons (some exons overlap with multiple H3K36me3
peaks), which represent a slight overrepresentation relative to a random set of
regions (~145 overlaps on average when 446 exons were drawn at random from all exons
a thousand times; Chi-squared test, pβ€‰<β€‰0.001). H3K4me3 is also
slightly overrepresented (113 overlaps versus 71 at random,
pβ€‰<β€‰0.001), whereas H3K27me3 is not overrepresented over skipped exons
(~35 peaks overlapped both skipped and non-skipped exons).From metagene sections of average enrichment profiles containing the skipped exon as
well as introns upstream and downstream of the skipping event, we find that both the
upstream intron and the skipped exon display higher levels of H3K36me3 than average,
determined from random selections of the entire set of introns and exons
(FigureΒ 5). Introns localized downstream of the skipped
exons only show slightly higher H3K36me3 enrichment values than the average. Since
H3K36me3 associates with expressed genes [61], a possible explanation for H3K36me3 enrichment on the skipped exons may
be that the exons are only skipped in a subpopulation of cells in the embryo,
reflecting distinct transcript profiles in individual cells. Isoforms with the exon
included can thus be more prevalent and account for the observed enrichment in
H3K36me3. However as expected, globally in the cell populations examined, the skipped
exons have on average substantially lower number of reads mapped to them than the
rest of the exons (Figure S8 in Additional file 1). This
shows that the H3K36me3 enrichment at skipped exons is not due to expression of an
isoform with the exon included in the majority of the cells. Collectively, our
observations are consistent with a role of H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 as possible
facilitators, rather than determinants, of increased exon skipping [24,62].Figure 5Metagene projections of average H3K36me3 enrichment levels over skipped
exons and surrounding introns. Metagenes based on H3K36me3 levels for
upstream introns, skipped exons and downstream introns show increased H3K36me3
levels in the upstream intron and the exon, but only to minor extent in the
downstream intron, as compared to background. Red

(startβ€‰=β€‰0% and endβ€‰=β€‰100%) and the Y-axis is the
H3K36me3 signal normalized against input control and the total number of reads

important role in mRNA stability, spatial distribution and translational efficiency [65]. We observe that zygotic transcripts frequently have longer 3β€™UTRs
than corresponding maternal transcripts, as exemplified by pou5f1
(FigureΒ 4d, arrow 4; black and white arrow in Figure S7
in Additional file 1). To investigate the genome-wide
frequency of longer 3β€™UTR in post-ZGA relative to pre-ZGA embryos, we extracted
all last exons and counted the number of reads mapping to the first and second half
of the last exon. Using these counts, we calculated a numeric score where higher
values indicate a shift towards a longer 3β€™ terminal exon post-ZGA (see
Methods). We find that 1,249 last exons increase in length post-ZGA relative to
pre-ZGA (Additional file 13). A metagene projection for
these 1,249 last exons using RNA-seq coverage confirms the detection of more reads in
the last half of the exons post-ZGA (FigureΒ 6a). The
observation of longer 3β€™UTRs can be interpreted in light of a recent report of
shorter 3β€™UTRs of highly expressed transcripts [66]. We may infer from this report and our results that post-ZGA embryos
produce transcripts with a more diversified control of turn-over kinetics, together
with spatial and cell-type specific expression, than the oocyte. In Drosophila
melanogaster, extension of 3β€™UTRs after the maternal-to-zygotic
transition (coinciding with the MBT) have been reported [67]. Similarly in the mouse, the 3β€™UTR becomes progressively longer
during embryonic development [68]. Furthermore, while this manuscript was in preparation, Ulitsky and
colleagues [69] reported extended 3β€™UTRs in 419 genes after ZGA in zebrafish
embryos, using poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing. Thus our findings validate
previous reports in zebrafish and other species.Figure 6Extended 3β€™ terminal exons and alternative last exons. (a)
Metagene representation of RNA-seq reads for the last exon in a set of
transcripts detected with more coverage in the proximal half of the terminal
exon post-ZGA (red line) as compared to pre-ZGA (blue line). X-axis is in
percentage of total length and Y-axis is number of reads normalized against
total number of reads in the samples. (b) The gene magi1
displays a change in the expression of its isoforms pre- and post-ZGA with an
alternative 3β€™UTR appearing post-ZGA (red double-arrow). Prior to the ZGA
a novel isoform is expressed (blue double-arrow). This isoform is expressed
also after the MBT but then together with the novel isoform.In addition to the extension of last exons, we also observe alternative last exon
usage, which may lead to changes in the CDS, the 3β€™UTR or both. An example of
the latter is apparent in magi1, encoding a PDZ domain protein; due to a
switch in last exon usage between pre- and post-ZGA, both the CDS and the 3β€™UTR
are changed (FigureΒ 6b; see also RT-qPCR validation in
Figure S9 in Additional file 1). The 3β€™UTR of the
post-ZGA-specific isoform contains three additional sequence domains absent in the
maternal version, namely an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a sex-lethal binding
site (SXL-BS) and a K-box element. The latter two are known to often co-occur to
create spatial and temporal expression patterns through negative regulation of
translation [70,71]. In addition, although the PDZ domains are not directly affected,
alteration in protein sequence might affect the protein 3D-structure and in
particular the fifth PDZ domain located proximal to the C-terminus [72]. Interestingly, Magi1 interacts with Ξ²-catenin [73], another regulator of cell adhesion crucial for left-right asymmetry of
the embryo [8,74]. Each PDZ domain often displays distinct protein specificity and
strikingly, Ξ²-catenin binding to MAGI1 depends on the 5th PDZ domain,
thus potentially linking the isoform switch reported in our study to the regulation
of Wnt signaling through Ξ²-catenin [75].

The transcriptomes assembled in this study contain a high degree of complexity
pertaining to TSSs, AS and TTSs. Most of the described novel isoforms encode ORFs with
predicted significant functional protein domains, suggesting functional and valid
transcripts with a role in development. We report several loci which display a
switch-like behavior in isoforms expressed pre-ZGA and post-ZGA stages; these notably
include dazl (TSS switch), f11r (exon skipping) and magi1
(alternative last exon usage). Their changes in expression pattern coincide with key
developmental processes such as onset of transcription upon ZGA, cell speciation and
migration, suggesting functional roles for these isoforms. We also identify validated
novel isoforms for dnmt1 and pou5f1, important genes in development
and pluripotency control. Moreover, we find increased length of the 3β€™ terminal
exon and 3β€™UTR after the ZGA in over 1,000 transcripts. Analysis of histone marks
suggests that H3K4me3 has little value in marking the major TSS in loci with several
start sites. However, we find higher levels of H3K36me3 over skipped exons relative to
all exons, suggesting a role of H3K36me3 in zebrafish AS control.

Methods
ioinformatics. Bioinformatic analyses relied heavily on custom python scripts and the use of
publically available tools such as SAMtools [76] and BEDtools [77], as well as general data handling in R [78]. Python scripts critical for the analyses are available as supplementary
material (Additional file 14). Data were visualized in the
Integrative Genomics viewer [79].RNA-seq mapping and transcriptome assemblyEmbryo collection and RNA sequencing was performed as previously described [5]. Raw data files are available from NCBIβ€™s short read archive
(GSE22830). Reads were mapped using Bioscope 1.3 (with default settings) and TopHat
1.3.1 (with default options except: -aβ€‰=β€‰5, -Iβ€‰=β€‰50,
-Fβ€‰=β€‰0). The resulting SAM-files were merged and a python script
(best_alignment.py) used to ensure that a read were only present once. We performed
transcriptome assembly using Cufflinks (version 1.2.1), with Ensembl annotation as
guide (Zv9, annotation version 64), using default settings except;
Fβ€‰=β€‰0.0, -jβ€‰=β€‰0.05, -Aβ€‰=β€‰0.08,
--3-overhang-toleranceβ€‰=β€‰100. Additional programs in the Cufflinks
pipeline were used to merge files, compare transcripts to known annotation and detect
differences between the stages [80]. We created additional datasets using scripts; FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3 using
extract_gtf.py, TSSβ€™s using get_tss_bed.py and TTS using get_tts.py.Sequence analysisWe extracted transcript sequences using gffread in Cufflinks. These were subjected to
ORF prediction using getORF (with settings: -minsize 150, -sreverse_sequence No,
-find 1) from the EMBOSS suite [81]. The resulting protein sequences were processed by scripts and R handling
to retrieve the longest predicted ORF. We used Pfam to identify functional domains
(Pfam A) [31] and domains considered significant by Pfam were used. A script
(β€�domain_compare.pyβ€™) was used to identify if domains were retained, lost
or gained relative to the closest matching transcript. Detection of motifs in the
3β€™UTR was performed using UTRScan [82].Alternative splicingWe used ASTALAVISTA version 2.2 [51] to quantify alternative splicing events. This program takes as input a GTF
file (FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3) and outputs all splicing events in the annotation
together with a code representing type of event (exon skipping, intron retention,
alternative acceptor site, alternative donor site). We used python scripts to extract
and count events from the ASTALAVISTA output (summary.py and events.py).Detection of length changes in last exonWe designed a database of non-redundant last exons (get_last_exon.py) and after
initial filtering (exonsβ€‰>β€‰400Β bp, FPKMβ€‰>β€‰3 in both
samples, nβ€‰=β€‰10,349 last exons) we used a script (find_extended_utrs.py)
to idenitfy exons with a length change between pre- and post-ZGA. This was achieved
by counting the number of reads in the first and latter part of the exon. A score was
calculated as follows:Q=p2β€“p1*logFPKMpre+FPKMpost)/2where p1 and p2 are the proportions of reads in the last part of the exon relative to
the first part pre- and post-ZGA, respectively. Exons with a shift towards more reads
in the last part post-ZGA will have a positive value. We weighted this value using
the log-transformed average of the exons FPKM values pre- and post-ZGA, assuming that
higher coverage gives a more robust estimate of change.Analysis of ChIP-seq dataEmbryos for ChIP-seq were collected at 5.3 hpf and chromatin prepared as described [83]. In accordance with institutional, national and international guidelines
for early stage (0β€“5.3 hpf) zebrafish embryos no ethics committee approval was
needed for any of the experiments performed in this study. Immunoprecipitation was
performed using H3K36me3 (Diagenode 058β€“050, Denville, NJ) and ChIP enriched
DNA and input samples prepared for sequencing according to Illumina standard protocol
(#11257047 Rev.A). ChIP-seq reads were mapped using BWA [84] and peaks detected using CCAT 3.0 (Settings: fragment
sizeβ€‰=β€‰200, sliding window sizeβ€‰=β€‰500, minimum
scoreβ€‰=β€‰3.0) [85]. Intron and exons from single exon skipping events identified by
ASTALAVISTA were extracted with a script (extract_skipped_exon.py) and BEDtools used
to count the number of reads supporting each event. Events with >5 reads post-ZGA
were considered further. We created databases of all introns and exons using the
β€�allβ€™ annotation. The number of overlapping peaks and skipped exons
(>1Β bp overlap between peak and exon skipping event: from start upstream intron
to stop downstream intron) were calculated using BEDtools and the random control
using a script (bootstr_rand.py). We utilized Repitools to construct metagens [86]. H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 peak data were from a recently published paper
(Pauli et al., 2012). We identified potential bidirectional promoters using
ChIPpeakAnno [87] with the H3K4me3 data [13] and the β€�allβ€™ gene annotation file. The TSS of either gene in
the pair had to be within 1000Β bp of the middle of the H3K4me3 peak.PCR and cloningNewly assembled and annotated isoforms were validated by RT-(q)PCR. RNA from pools of
embryos at different stages was isolated using TRIzol reagent followed by RNA cleanup
using Qiagen RNeasy MiniKit (Hilden, Germany) as previously described [88]. Control RNA of kanamycin (Promega #C1381, Madison, Wisconsin) was added
prior to the RNA extraction and used as the reference control by qPCR. RNA was
reverse transcribed using iScript Select cDNA synthesis Kit (BioRad #170-8896,
Hercules, CA) according to the manufactures instructions. Primers were designed to
cover specific sequences resulting from alternative splicing (f11r),
alternative TSS (dazl), and alternative last exon usage (magi1)
(for details see Supplementary Table 1 in Additional file 15). The dynamics of the isoforms was confirmed by RT-qPCR. qPCR was
performed with the iCycler MyiQ real time PCR detection system and SYBR Green
(BioRad, Hercules, CA). Primers pairs gave no signal in PCRs lacking template (data
not shown). Relative expression was determined by the β�†β�†-CT
method. For pou5f1, both primers were designed in the sequence common for
the predicted isoforms (Supplementary Table 1 in Additional file 15). Presence of the isoforms at 3.5 hpf was confirmed by TOPO TA
cloning (Invitrogen K45-0001, Carlsberg, CA) and subsequent sequencing of randomly
selected clones.Data accessChIP-seq data for H3K36me3 and input are available under [NCBI GEO GSE40629]. Our
RNA-seq data are available under [NCBI GEO GSE22830].
