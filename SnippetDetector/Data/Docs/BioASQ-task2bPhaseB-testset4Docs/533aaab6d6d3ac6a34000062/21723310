Dengue is the most important arbovirus in the world with an estimated of 50 million dengue infections occurring annually and approximately 2.5 billion people living in dengue endemic countries. Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever with high mortality that is transmitted by mosquitoes. Effective vaccines against yellow fever have been available for almost 70 years and are responsible for a significant reduction of occurrences of the disease worldwide; however, approximately 200,000 cases of yellow fever still occur annually, principally in Africa. Therefore, it is a public health priority to develop antiviral agents for treatment of these virus infections. Crotalus durissus terrificus snake, a South American rattlesnake, presents venom with several biologically actives molecules. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of crude venom and isolated toxins from Crotalus durissus terrificus and found that phospholipases A₂ showed a high inhibition of Yellow fever and dengue viruses in VERO E6 cells.
