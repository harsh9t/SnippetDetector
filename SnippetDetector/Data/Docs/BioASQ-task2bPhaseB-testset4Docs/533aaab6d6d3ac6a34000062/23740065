INTRODUCTION: Yellow fever is a non-contagious infectious disease, highly lethal, transmitted by the Aedes, Haemagogus and Sabethes. METHODS: Descriptive retrospective study of the yellow fever cases in Amazonas, between 1996 and 2009. RESULTS: Forty two cases of yellow fever were confirmed, with 30 deaths, 10% of which were foreigners. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in both rural Amazonas and its capital demonstrates the dispersion of these vectors and underscores the need for better and continuous epidemiological and entomological control.
