INTRODUCTION: Yellow fever is a serious illness public health importance and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Haemagogus and Sabethes in the rural and forest environments, and by Aedes aegypti in the urban setting. In Colombia, Haemagogus janthinomys and H. equinus are considered efficient vectors of this viral disease. OBJECTIVE: The presence of the mosquito Haemagogus equinus was recorded over an 8 year period, in the periurban areas of the Soledad and Malambo municipalities (Atlantico Province) of northern Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data was obtained from records of the entomological collections from two collection sites: (1) 14 larva traps located at the Erneasto Cortissoz airport in the municipality of Soledad between 1997--2005 and (2) 10 larva traps located at Vergara and Velasco Batallion in the municipality of Malambo in 2005. RESULTS: Haemogogus equinus was reported for the first time in Soledad in 1998. In the following 8 years, 197 larvae were reported. The individuals were found sharing the trap with Aedes aegypti, Culex nigripalpus and Uranotaenia lowii. In Malambo, the first discovery of H.equinus occurred in 2005, with a total of 641 larvae. No other Culicidae were associated with it. CONCLUSION: The presence of H. equinus in larvitraps located near the urban zone, shows adaptation to the use of artificial containers as larval habitats, Urbanization of this species in zones with a high Ae. aegypti infestation index increases the potential introduction of sylvan yellow fever virus and constitutes a risk for re-emergence of urban cycles of yellow fever.
