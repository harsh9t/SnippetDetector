Cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly in the form of coronary artery disease, is the leading cause of death in the United States. Research in the past 10 years links pathogenic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) modification to oxidation damage by free radicals. This review summarizes the major findings of CVD-related epidemiologic research and clinical trials conducted in the past 5 years on vitamins A, C, and E. Vitamin supplementation behaviors are discussed. In prospective studies, the intake of vitamins A, C, and E has been correlated with lower mortality rates. When recent clinical trials and oxidation studies are analyzed, the weight of evidence suggests that 100-400 IU of daily vitamin E over 2 years or more may be most efficacious in reducing low-density lipoprotein oxidation and positively influencing mortality rates from CVD in primary care. Research also supports vitamin E supplementation in patients with known CAD or a history of transient ischemic attacks. Persons with diabetes or hypertension as well as smokers may benefit from supplemental vitamin C intake. Targeted antioxidant vitamin intake should be included in CVD risk assessment and primary preventive counseling efforts.
