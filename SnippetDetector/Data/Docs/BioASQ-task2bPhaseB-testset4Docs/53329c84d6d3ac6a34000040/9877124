Decreased antioxidant-vitamin nutritional status may increase lipid peroxidation and susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidative modification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vitamin nutritional status of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and to assess the risk of CAD related to each individual antioxidant vitamin. The study was performed as a case-control study with 41 patients with angiographically demonstrated CAD and 41 apparently healthy age- and smoking status-matched controls. Plasma vitamin E, C and A concentrations were significantly decreased in CAD patients compared with controls (p < 0.001) after correcting for significant covariates. Per quartile decrease in vitamin A and E concentrations was associated with increased risk of CAD, even after adjusting for CAD risk factors, while per quartile decrease in vitamin C concentrations was not associated with significant CAD risk after adjusting for CAD risk factors. Decreased vitamin A and E concentrations are independently associated with increased risk of CAD independent from other CAD risk factors in white male South Africans and dietary intervention strategies are advocated.
