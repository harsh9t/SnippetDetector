Attention is focusing on the relationship between homocysteine and cardiovascular disease and the role of vitamins in the management of this prevalent ailment. Epidemiologic studies have shown that a relationship between elevated homocysteine concentrations and cardiovascular disease may exist; however, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been proven. The B vitamins are key components of homocysteine metabolism, and the trend is toward their being increasingly prescribed for cardiovascular disease. Prescribing of antioxidant vitamins, vitamin E in particular, has increased as well. Vitamin E may decrease the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease, but its benefit in preventing fatal myocardial infarction has not been shown. Vitamin supplements are not warranted in all patients with cardiovascular disease but may have a place in therapy for selected patients.
