Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an important mitochondrial electron transfer component and has been postulated to function as a powerful antioxidant protecting LDL from oxidative damage. It could thus reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus far, beneficial effects of supplementation with CoQ10 have been reported. To study the relation between unsupplemented concentrations of plasma CoQ10 and coronary atherosclerosis, we performed a case-control study among 71 male cases with angiographically documented severe coronary atherosclerosis and 69 healthy male controls free from symptomatic cardiovascular disease and without atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery. Plasma CoQ10 concentrations (mean +/- SE) were 0.86+/-0.04 vs. 0.83+/-0.04 micromol/l for cases and controls, respectively. The CoQ10/LDL-cholesterol ratio (micromol/ mmol) was slightly lower in cases than in controls (0.22+/-0.01 vs. 0.26+/-0.03). Differences in CoQ10 concentrations and CoQ10/LDL-cholesterol ratio did not reach significance. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the risk of coronary atherosclerosis calculated per micromol/l increase of CoQ10 was 1.12 (0.28-4.43) after adjustment for age, smoking habits, total cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. We conclude that an unsupplemented plasma CoQ10 concentration is not related to risk of coronary atherosclerosis.
