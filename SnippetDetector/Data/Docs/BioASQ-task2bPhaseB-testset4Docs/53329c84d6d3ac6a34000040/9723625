Epidemiologic studies have suggested that vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) may play a preventive role in reducing the incidence of atherosclerosis. The aim of this paper was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of vitamin E supplementation in patients with coronary artery disease using data from the Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study (CHAOS). The study compared cost-effectiveness in the context of Australian and United States (US) health care utilization. The main clinical outcome used in the economic evaluation was the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) which was nonfatal. Utilization of health care resources was estimated by conducting a survey of Australian clinicians and published Australian and US cost data. Cost savings of $127 (A$181) and $578/patient randomized to vitamin E therapy compared with patients receiving placebo were found for Australian and US settings, respectively. Savings in the vitamin E group were due primarily to reduction in hospital admissions for AMI. This occurred because the vitamin E group had a 4.4% lower absolute risk of AMI than did the placebo group. Less than 10% of health care costs in the Australian evaluation was due to vitamin E ($150 [A$214/patient]). Our economic evaluation indicates that vitamin E therapy in patients with angiographically proven atherosclerosis is cost-effective in the Australian and US settings.
