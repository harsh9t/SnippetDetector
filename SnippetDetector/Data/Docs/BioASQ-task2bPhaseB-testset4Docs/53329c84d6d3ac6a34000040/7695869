This review briefly summarizes the scientific evidence for a possible role of antioxidants in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Antioxidants in our diet include vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene, whereas selenium is an integral part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx). Experimental evidence suggests that free-radical damage and antioxidant defence may play an important role in the development of coronary heart disease. Epidemiological studies have produced some intriguing results, but have not indicated unequivocally that a high intake of antioxidants leads to a decreased cardiovascular disease risk. We conclude that the antioxidant atherosclerosis hypothesis is promising, but that the results of long-term intervention studies are still to be awaited. Preventive action based on antioxidant supplementation is therefore not justifiable as yet. Nevertheless, the findings so far certainly do support the recommendations for a varied diet rich in vegetables and fruit.
