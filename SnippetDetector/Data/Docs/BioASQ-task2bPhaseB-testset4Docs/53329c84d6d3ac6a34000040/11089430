Lipid peroxidation is thought to be one of the major factors involved in atherogenesis. There is an increasing evidence is increasing that oxidation of LDL cholesterol may be instrumental in atherogenesis. Diabetics are known to be at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, a phenomenon which has previously been linked to the lipid peroxidation process. As a result, a number of studies have been undertaken to evaluate the effects of antioxidant vitamins on coronary heart disease and risks factors of ischaemic heart disease such as diabetes mellitus. Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status were studied in 51 patients with ischaemic heart disease and some of with having diabetes mellitus (18%). Results were compared before and after supplementation of 450 mg of tocopherol acetate for three months. SOD were found to be elevated in patients with diabetes and in whole groups of patients after supplementation of tocopherol acetate. Also, TAS was found to be elevated in a subgroup of patients without diabetes and no significant changes were found in glutathion-peroxidase after supplementation. We found statistically significantly decreased mean values of glucose after supplementation in all groups of patients. The monitoring of antioxidant parameters in diabetic patients could be of vital importance in the study of the disease.
