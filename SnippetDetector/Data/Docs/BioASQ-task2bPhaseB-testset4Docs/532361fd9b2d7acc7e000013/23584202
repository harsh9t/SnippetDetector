Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common form of familial brain arteriopathy, is associated with deposition of granular osmiophilic material (GOM). We used immunohistochemistry and immunogold electron microscopy (EM) to examine the distribution of GOM and NOTCH3 ectodomain (N3ECD) protein in microvasculature of brain gray matter and white matter in patients with CADASIL, non-CADASIL hereditary small-vessel disease and sporadic age-related degenerative disease, and comparable-age controls. We observed intense immunostaining patterns with 2 different anti-N3ECD antibodies in CADASIL but not in young and older controls or other small-vessel disease patients. In addition, CADASIL samples exhibited immunoreactivity in arterial walls and in most capillaries. Electron microscopy revealed profound and widespread extracellular distribution of 0.2- to 2-μm GOM deposits associated with meningeal vessels and perforating arteries and arterioles. Granular osmiophilic material was adjacent to capillaries even within white matter. Immunogold EM with antibody A1-1 to N3ECD revealed abundant particles in GOM within microvessels, vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, and perivascular cells. Granular osmiophilic material did not exhibit immunogold labeling for smooth muscle α-actin or collagen IV. These results showed the specificity of the antibodies and confirm the predominant localization of N3ECD within GOM deposits. The extensive distribution of N3ECD-GOM complexes within meninges, arteries, arterioles, and particularly capillaries in the brains of CADASIL patients suggests that NOTCH3 fragments are major components of GOM deposits, which may be eliminated via perivascular routes.
