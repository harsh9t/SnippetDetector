Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common form of hereditary cerebral angiopathy. We present a case in which a pattern of diffusion signal change compatible with bihemispheric acute watershed infarcts occurred in a symptomatic patient demonstrating global hypoperfusion. To our knowledge, watershed infarcts in the clinical presentation of CADASIL have not been previously described.
