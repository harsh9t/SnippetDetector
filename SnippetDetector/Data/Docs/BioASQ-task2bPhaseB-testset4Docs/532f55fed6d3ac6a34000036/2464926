Mutated cDNA clones containing the entire coding sequence of human glucocerebrosidase were isolated from libraries originated from Gaucher patients. Sequence analysis of a mutated cDNA derived from a type II Gaucher patient revealed a C-to-G transversion causing a substitution of an arginine for a proline at residue 415. This change creates a new cleavage site for the enzyme HhaI in the mutated cDNA. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization made it possible to show that this mutation exists in the genomic DNA of the patient. From a cDNA library originated from a type I Gaucher patient, a mutated allele was cloned that contains a T-to-C transition causing a substitution of proline for leucine at residue 444 and creating a new NciI site. This mutation is identical to that described by S. Tsuji and colleagues in genomic DNA from type I, type II, and type III patients. Since the new NciI site generates RFLP, it was used to test the existence of this mutated allele in several Gaucher patients by Southern blot analysis. This allele was found in type I (Jewish and non-Jewish), type II, and type III Gaucher patients. These findings led us to conclude that the patient suffering from type II disease (denoted GM1260) carried both mutations described above. Any one of the amino acid changes described reduces the glucocerebrosidase activity as tested by transfection of COS cells with expression vectors harboring the mutated cDNAs. The base changes in the two mutated cDNAs do not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the corresponding polypeptides on an SDS polyacrylamide gel.
