The mutation N370S accounts for 63% of the mutated glucocerebrosidase alleles of Portuguese type 1 Gaucher patients. It has been shown previously that this mutation is linked to the Pv1.1- form of the PvuII polymorphism and suggested that the N370S mutation in glucocerebrosidase alleles has an Ashkenazi Jewish origin. We have found that in Portuguese type 1 Gaucher patients this mutation is also invariably associated with the Pv1.1- haplotype, despite the fact that there is no evidence of Ashkenazi Jewish background in this population.
