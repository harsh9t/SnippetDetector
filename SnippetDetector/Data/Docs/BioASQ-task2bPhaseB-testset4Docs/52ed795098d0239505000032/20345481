Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities. However, little is known about the regulation of HO-1 in human primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Here we investigated the expression of HO-1 in primary and established AML cells as well as other types of leukemic cells and normal monocytes, and its regulatory mechanism by the transcriptional repressor, BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1), and the activator, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Leukemic cell lines such as U937 expressed little HO-1, whereas most freshly isolated AML cells and monocytes expressed substantial amounts of HO-1, along with Bach1 and Nrf2. When U937 cells were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PHA) or gamma-interferon, they significantly expressed both HO-1 and Bach1, like primary AML cells. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced HO-1 expression in U937 cells but suppressed it in primary monocytes and PMA-treated U937 cells. In HO-1-expressing cells, Bach1 was localized in the cytoplasm, but Nrf2 was localized in the nuclei. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay of these cells revealed the preferential binding of Nrf2 over Bach1 to Maf-recognition elements, the enhancer regions of the HO-1 gene. The downregulation of the HO-1 gene with siRNA increased a cytotoxic effect of an anticancer drug on primary AML cells, whereas the downregulation of Bach1 increased HO-1 expression, leading to enhanced survival. These and other results show that Bach1 plays a critical role in regulating HO-1 gene expression in AML cells and its expression suppresses their survival by downregulating HO-1 expression. Thus, functional upregulation of Bach1 is a potential strategy for antileukemic therapy.
