BTB and CNC homologue 1 (Bach1) is a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). This study hypothesized that Bach1 plays an important role in the indomethacin-induced apoptosis in the case of small-intestinal mucosal injury. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 (wild-type) and homozygous Bach1-deficient C57BL/6 mice were included in this study. Mucosal injuries induced by subcutaneously administering indomethacin were evaluated macroscopically, histologically and biochemically. Indomethacin-induced injuries were improved in Bach1-deficient mice. Immunohistochemistry showed an increase in the number of HO-1-positive cells, which were mainly F4/80 positive macrophages, in Bach1-deficient mice. Indomethacin administration increased the expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein in the small intestine in Bach1-deficient mice. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining showed that the extent of apoptosis was suppressed in Bach1-deficent mice. In conclusion, deficiency of the Bach1 gene inhibited apoptosis and thus suppressed mucosal injury, indicating that Bach1 is a novel therapeutic target for indomethacin-induced intestinal injury.
