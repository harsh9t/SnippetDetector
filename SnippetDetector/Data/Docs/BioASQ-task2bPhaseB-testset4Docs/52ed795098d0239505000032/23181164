<abstract>
Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor which modulates several critical transcriptional responses, such as the expression of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene in response to oxidative stress. In our recent study, we found that Bach1 possesses a novel role in mitotic chromosome alignment during metaphase. Upon BACH1 depletion in HeLa cells, mitotic chromosomes become unstable. This defect was efficiently rescued by expressing Bach1 fragments that lack the DNA binding domain, indicating that its function in mitosis involves a transcription-independent mechanism. The nuclear export signal (NES/CLS) of Bach1 is required for the mitotic function. Bach1 is excluded from the mitotic chromosomes depending on its NES/CLS and the nuclear exporter Crm1. Our findings suggest that Bach1 might mediate the regulation of mitotic chromosomes under conditions of cellular stress.

Regulation of the ubcellular ocalization of ach1
ach1 ( and  homology 1) is a transcriptional repressor, the target genes of which include heme oxygenase-1 (-1) and globin genes. -1 promotes iron recycling by degrading heme into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide () and biliverdin, which is rapidly reduced to bilirubin. ecause bilirubin and  possess cytoprotective roles and heme is a potent prooxidant, -1 protects cells from diverse stresses.1,2 nlike other transcription factors, the subcellular localization of ach1 is regulated by multiple mechanisms. irst, ach1 possesses an exportin1/rm1-dependent nuclear export signal () whose activity is activated by direct heme binding (ig. 1).3 econd, ach1 possesses another  at its -terminus. his signal, originally discovered on ach1-related factor ach2 as a cytoplasmic localization signal (), is activated by cadmium in an -dependent manner.4,5 hus, ach1 responds to both heme and cadmium, two potent inducers of -1, by distinct mechanisms. hird, ach1 interacts with the cytoplasmic, microtubule-associated, intracellular hyaluronic acid binding protein , also known as the receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility ().6  has been suggested to play a role in the organization of the cytoskeletal network by interacting with microtubules and actin filaments, and thus, plays a role in cell morphology and motility.7 t has been unclear why the subcellular localization of ach1 is regulated by multiple mechanisms. owever, it appears that each of the mechanisms may mediate a response to particular signals. lternatively, some of the mechanisms may connect ach1 with non-transcriptional functions, which we discuss below.
igure. Β 1. A model of the dual functions of Bach1 during interphase and metaphase of the cell cycle. (A) Bach1 occupies MARE enhancers to repress transcription under normal conditions. The elimination of the Bach1-mediated transcriptional repression occurs through inhibition of its DNA binding activity and subsequent Crm1-dependent nuclear export in response to oxidative stress. (B) The kinetochore localization of Crm1 mediates the exclusion of Bach1 from mitotic chromosomes and may be required for the kinetochore recruitment of RanBP2 and RanGAP1. We hypothesize that the misalignment of mitotic chromosomes due to Bach1 depletion might involve an improper kinetochore localization of RanGAP1, RanBP2 and/or Crm1.

Bach1 as a egulator of itotic hromosomes at etaphase
rnaoutov et al.8 first reported the behavior of rm1 during mitosis and showed that rm1 is a mitotic effector of an- in somatic cells. rm1 and an- are essential for the stable recruitment of an-1/an-2 to kinetochores, the formation of normal kinetochore fibers, and faithful chromosome segregation.8 onsidering that both of the nuclear export signals of ach1 are rm1-dependent, and the  may connect ach1 to tubulin, we hypothesized that ach1 might play a role during mitosis through a rm1-dependent mechanism beyond its canonical transcriptional function.
n our recent study, we discovered a novel role of ach1 in the regulation of mitotic chromosome dynamics. o examine the role of ach1 in mitosis, we used short hairpin  (sh. RNA) to deplete endogenous BACH1 in HeLa cells. Surprisingly, the BACH1 depletion resulted in disordered mitotic chromosome alignment, including a thicker mitotic chromosome plate, collapsed ring-like shape and oscillating chromosome axis. These defects were efficiently rescued by not only wild-type mouse Bach1, but also its derivatives lacking the DNA binding domain, suggesting that the function of Bach1 in mitosis involves a transcription-independent mechanism.9 Furthermore, Bach1 derivatives lacking the C-terminal NES/CLS failed to rescue the mitotic defects in BACH1-depleted HeLa cells, thus suggesting the involvement of Crm1 in this process. Consistent with this prediction, Bach1 was excluded from mitotic chromosomes in a manner depending on both CLS and Crm1.
Unexpectedly, the misalignment of chromosomes due to the depletion of BACH1 did not cause a fatal cell cycle failure. This result suggests that the abnormal mitotic chromosomes observed in the BACH1-depleted cells reflect a transient process which can be corrected immediately by a redundant, compensating activity. The time-lapse analysis of BACH1-depleted cells revealed dynamic changes of the mitotic chromosomes. BACH1-depleted cells showed the transient formation of a thicker mitotic chromosome plate and misorientation of the mitotic axis. Moreover, these thicker mitotic chromosomes and their axes oscillated in the proximity of the lateral cell cortex.9

The itotic ole of ach1 ight nvolve a ynein-dependent echanism
hese observations strongly suggest that ach1 is involved in the regulation of mitotic chromosome formation and its dynamics. lthough the molecular basis for this regulation is still unclear, the findings of previous reports suggest several interesting possibilities. irst, the cortical dynein localization is regulated by two distinct intrinsic signals to determine the spindle position and orientation in symmetrically dividing human cells: a spindle pole-derived signal of lk1 and a chromosome-derived gradient of an. GTP.10 On the other hand, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) causes dynein-dependent spindle rotations along the z-axis, resulting in spindle misorientation.11 Taken together, these observations suggest that a dynein-dynactin-dependent pulling force on astral microtubules is essential for maintaining the spindle orientation. Surprisingly, we found that BACH1 interacts with DYNLL1 (dynein light chain 1) according to the MitoCheck database (www.mitocheck.org). Therefore, future studies should examine how Bach1 interacts with dynein to regulate the mitotic chromosome alignment.

Possible nvolvement of ach1 in the 2-1 athway
mportin-² is the main vector for protein import in interphase nuclei.12 t also has roles after nuclear envelope breakdown through binding with  to release some -containing mitotic factors, and thus functions in spindle organization.13  recent study showed that overexpression of importin-² induces mitotic dynamic defects, including multi-polar division and unstable chromosome alignment called β€�a broader plate.β€� his defect appears to be due to the inhibition of 1 recruitment to mitotic kinetochores, an event that is known to require microtubule attachment and the exportin, 1.8,14 o-expression with 2 or 1 suppresses the importin-²-induced mitotic dynamic defects. nterestingly, this β€�broader plateβ€� phenotype is similar to that of 1-depleted e. La cells. Therefore, the mitotic chromosome misalignment due to BACH1 depletion might involve an improper kinetochore localization of RANGAP1 and/or CRM1 (Fig.Β 1B).

To clarify the molecule(s) that link Bach1 in mouse cells to the regulation of mitotic chromosomes, we are currently investigating the protein network of Bach1 by a proteomic analysis. Among the various proteins found to interact with Bach1, ATM (unpublished data) is one of the critical regulators of the DNA damage response (DDR). Another interesting protein is Bub1 (unpublished data) which is a key kinase involved in spindle checkpoint activation. In addition to the classical DDR function, ATM is also activated by Aurora-B during mitosis. The mitotic activation of ATM is required for the activation of Bub1, thus regulating the spindle checkpoint. It should be noted that this novel role of ATM is separable from the DDR.15 Taken together, these findings warrant further studies about the molecular mechanism underlying how Bach1 regulates chromosome alignment during mitosis.
