Ferritin gene transcription is regulated by heme as is ferritin mRNA translation, which is mediated by the well studied mRNA.IRE/IRP protein complex. The heme-sensitive DNA sequence in ferritin genes is the maf recognition/antioxidant response element present in several other genes that are induced by heme and repressed by Bach1. We now report that chromatin immunoprecipitated with Bach1 antiserum contains ferritin DNA sequences. In addition, overexpression of Bach1 protein in the transfected cells decreased ferritin expression, indicating insufficient endogenous Bach1 for full repression; decreasing Bach1 with antisense RNA increased ferritin expression. Thioredoxin reductase1, a gene that also contains a maf recognition/antioxidant response element but is less studied, responded similarly to ferritin, as did the positive controls heme oxygenase1 and NADP(H) quinone (oxido) reductase1. Bach1-DNA promoter interactions in cells were confirmed in vitro with soluble, recombinant Bach1 protein and revealed a quantitative range of Bach1/DNA stabilities: ferritin L approximately ferritin H approximately beta-globin, beta-globin approximately 2-fold >heme oxygenase1 = quinone reductase beta-globin approximately 4-fold >thioredoxin reductase1. Such results indicate the possibility that modulation of cellular Bach1 concentrations will have variable effects among the genes coordinately regulated by maf recognition/antioxidant response elements in iron/oxygen/antioxidant metabolism.
