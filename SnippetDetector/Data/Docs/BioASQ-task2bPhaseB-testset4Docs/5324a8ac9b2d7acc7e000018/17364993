<abstract>
Imatinib is one of the most recent medications used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). It is an orally administered protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an enzyme which is produced by BCR-ABL fusion which results from translocation of 9:22 chromosome (Philadelphia chromosome). Imatinib blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL-expression in CML. Many side effects produced by imatinib have been documented but its induction of hepatotoxcity has been rarely reported. Only a few cases so far have been reported in the literature and almost all were in females. We describe another case of hepatotoxicity due to imatinib in a 17-year old female with clinical, laboratory and histopathological changes. The case described here suggests that imatinib may also induce immune hepatitis, in some patients.
