Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is arguably the best understood of all human malignancies. Its origins in the hematopoietic stem cell can be traced to a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22, dubbed the Philadelphia chromosome, which is observed in essentially all patients. The resulting fusion gene, BCR/ABL, encodes an activated tyrosine kinase that can act alone to induce a CML-like syndrome in mouse models. These animal models have validated BCR/ABL as a target for the development of specific pharmaceutical inhibitors. The kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is highly specific, effective, and minimally toxic, but may not effect cures as a single agent, particularly in patients with accelerated and blast-phase disease. Resistance to imatinib can confound therapy. Surprisingly, a high percentage of resistant cases manifest intact or augmented BCR/ABL signaling, suggesting that this oncoprotein, or signaling pathways emanating from it, remain viable targets. Combination chemotherapy is under active investigation, and among the most compelling strategies is dual treatment with agents that both target BCR/ABL signal transduction. BCR/ABL activates Ras, and compounds designed to antagonize Ras function called farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) have shown potent activity in vitro and in animal models of BCR/ABL-induced leukemia. Initial clinical trials in patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and CML in blast crisis have shown significant activity, suggesting that trials combining imatinib and FTIs are warranted.
