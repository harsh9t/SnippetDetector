Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, which is the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, and is cytogenetically visible as a shortened chromosome 22 (Philadelphia). Research during the past two decades has established that BCR-ABL is probably the pathogenetic pathway leading to CML, and that constitutive tyrosine kinase activity is central to BCR-ABL capacity to transform hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate was introduced into the treatment regimen for CML in 1998. During the last few years, reports on chromosomal changes during imatinib treatment have been described. In this study, we evaluated the random aneuploidy rate with chromosomes 9 and 18 in bone marrow from treated and untreated patients. We found higher aneuploidy rates in both treated and untreated patients compared to the control group. In three patients who were treated with imatinib mesylate for more than 1.5 years, triploidy also appeared in some nuclei. To our knowledge, this is the first report on new chromosomal changes such as random aneuploidy and triploidy under imatinib treatment, but more studies are needed to investigate the long-term effect of the imatinib treatment on genetic instability.
