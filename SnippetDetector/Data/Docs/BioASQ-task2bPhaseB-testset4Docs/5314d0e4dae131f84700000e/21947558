BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and often disabling symptom for cancer patients. To date, no pharmacological interventions have shown reliable efficacy in treatment of cancer-related fatigue (CF). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a key regulator of homeostasis, exerts arousing and analeptic actions in instances of behavioral depression. In the present pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of TRH as a treatment for CF. METHODS: Patients with cancer experiencing significant fatigue without medically reversible causes were enrolled in this study. The primary outcome measure was the visual analog scale for energy (VAS-E) assessed at 3, 7, and 24 h post-study medication administration. Secondary outcome measures included the profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire, a 6-min walking test, the hospital anxiety and depression scale, the Leeds sleep questionnaire, and assessment of quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F). RESULTS: Eight patients completed the study. TRH administration was associated with significant improvement in fatigue level as measured by the VAS-E, the fatigue and vigor subscales of the POMS, and the fatigue subscale of FACIT-F (p < 0.05). It was also associated with a positive impact on quality of life. TRH administration was associated with transient increases in blood pressure and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: TRH administration was efficacious, safe, and tolerable in the treatment of CF with a positive impact on quality of life. These results provide a crucial impetus for pursuing TRH therapeutics to treat CF.
