BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was an improvement over the Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass Study, which did not utilize physiological selection. To assess possible reasons for early closure of the COSS trial, we reviewed COSS methods used to identify high-risk patients and compared results with separate quantitative data. METHODS: Increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) by positron emission tomography is a gold standard for ischemia, but the specific thresholds and equivalency of the semiquantitative OEF ratio utilized in COSS and quantitative OEF are at issue. RESULTS: The semiquantitative hemispheric OEF ratio used in COSS did not identify the same group of patients as did quantitative OEF using a threshold of 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The failure of COSS is likely caused by a failure of the semiquantitative, hemispheric OEF ratio method rather than by the selection for bypass based on hemodynamic compromise.
