Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary cerebrovascular disease leading to accumulating neurologic deficits and dementia. CADASIL has been linked to nucleotide substitutions and deletions in the Notch3 gene. All the mutations described until now lead to unpaired cysteine residue in the epidermal growth factor-like repeats. The authors report a family with CADASIL carrying a deletion in the Notch3 gene that did not involve a cysteine residue.
