Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy is a cerebrovasuclar disease caused by NOTCH3 mutations, usually localized to exons 3 and 4. This report describes the clinical and neuroradiological findings of 2 subjects of two unrelated Japanese families who shared a common p.Arg332Cys mutation. The subject from family A presented syncope attacks as the sole clinical presentation at the beginning of his disease course. The subject from family B showed recurrent ischemic attacks, followed by a large intracranial hemorrhage. This is the first report to describe the detailed phenotypes of patients with a rare p.Arg332Cys mutation in Japan.
