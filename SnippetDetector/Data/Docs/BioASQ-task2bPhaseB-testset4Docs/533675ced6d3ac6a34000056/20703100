Histone H2AX phosphorylation on a C-terminal serine residue to form "γ-H2AX" is a critical early event in the chromatin response to chromosomal DNA double strand breaks in eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, γ-H2AX is formed when H2AX is phosphorylated on serine 139 by ATM or by other DNA damage response kinases. H2AX prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis, and supports class-switch recombination at immunoglobulin heavy chain loci in mammals. We showed previously that H2AX controls double strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR) between sister chromatids. The HR functions of H2AX are mediated by interaction of γ-H2AX with the chromatin-associated adaptor protein MDC1. H2AX is potentially subject to additional post-translational modifications associated with the DNA damage response and with other chromatin functions. To test this idea, we used mass spectroscopy to identify H2AX residues additional to serine 139 that are post-translationally modified following exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and identified several new IR-responsive residues of H2AX. We determined the impact of IR-responsive H2AX residues on cellular resistance to IR and on H2AX-dependent HR, and also analyzed the contribution to HR of other known or potential post-translationally modified residues of H2AX. The results suggest that the HR and IR-resistance functions of H2AX are controlled in large part by specific MDC1-interacting residues of H2AX, but that additional H2AX residues modulate these core functions of H2AX.
