Manipulation of chromatin, in which genomic DNA is packaged, is a fundamental requirement for all DNA-based metabolic processes in eukayotic cells. Histone variant incorporation, histone post-translational modifications, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling are three major strategies for chromatin manipulation, and are relatively well characterized in transcriptional regulation. Emerging lines of evidence indicate that histone variants (H2AX and H2A.Z), histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination) and chromatin-remodeling complexes (INO80, SWR1, SWI/SNF, RSC and NuRD) are important and direct players in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response as well. New studies also reveal that incorporation of histone variants into nucleosomes, histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling are specifically and intimately connected during the DSB damage response. This article summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of the relationship between chromatin modifications and the DSB damage response.
