This study explored older men's and their partners' reactions to a television news program on the medical debate surrounding the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening. Six focus groups, split by gender and socio-economic status (SES), were conducted with men aged 50 years or older (n = 28) and female partners of such men (n = 13). A self-completion questionnaire was also used to yield quantitative indices. In general, viewers appeared to appreciate from the debate that there was controversy surrounding prostate cancer screening, and they recognized that PSA testing is more applicable to certain subgroups of men. Although there were differences by SES and gender, the results suggest that exposing health consumers to medical uncertainty and "expert" conflict can help raise awareness of the issue and complexities involved. However, there was evidence to suggest that health consumers may be better able to negotiate conflicting medical information if the different sides of the argument are plainly noted and a clear distinction is made between opinion and evidence. This study has broader relevance to the management of media coverage of medical controversies by public health organizations.
