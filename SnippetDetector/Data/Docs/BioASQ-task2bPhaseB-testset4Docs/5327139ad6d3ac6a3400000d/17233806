OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability of a new measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using a blotting-paper assay (nanotest) compared to the standard PSA immunoassay. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The PSA level was measured in 205 men volunteers (median age 70 years, range 41-75) using a nanotest and a standard PSA immunoassay, collected at the same time; 30 microL of capillary blood placed on to a blotting paper were collected for the nanotest and sent by mail to the same laboratory for the two assays. The results were compared statistically using the Spearman test, the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Bland-Altman test. RESULTS: The nanotest threshold for an abnormal PSA level was 78 pg/mL, which corresponded to a standard PSA value of 3 ng/mL, with a sensitivity of 100%. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.98, Spearman test; P < 0.001) between the nanotest and the standard PSA assay. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.87. The Bland-Altman test showed a good agreement between the nanotest and the standard PSA assay, but there was an increasing proportional difference with increasing PSA value. CONCLUSION: There was a very high correlation between the nanotest and the standard PSA assay, especially for standard PSA levels of <5 ng/mL. Economic and clinical studies are indicated to confirm the utility of the nanotest in organized mass screening of prostate cancer.
