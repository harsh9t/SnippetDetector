The Arnold-Chiari malformation is very rare hindbrain abnormalities characterized by herniation of the hindbrain through the foramen magnum. It usually does not present until adulthood, and then its symptoms may be varied and subtle. Patient 49 years was diagnosed in Foniatrics and Audiology Clinic because of tinnitus in left ear lasting 3 months. She underwent audiological diagnostic, that did not reveal any abnormalities, except for electrogustometry and hyporeflexia of stapedial reflex and labyrinth on the left side. In MRI scan we have noticed hindbrain abnormalities characteristic for Chiari type I malformation. Treatment consisted of immediate supportive care as needed but without surgical decompression, which was found unnecessary.
