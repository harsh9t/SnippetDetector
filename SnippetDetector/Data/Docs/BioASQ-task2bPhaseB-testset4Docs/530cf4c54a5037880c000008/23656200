<abstract>
Recent clinical data suggest remarkable activity of ibrutinib, the first-in-class covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as excellent activity in other B cell malignancies, including in particular mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. This review evaluates the data from ongoing clinical and correlative studies of ibrutinib in B cell malignancies with a particular focus on CLL, and considers these data in the context of other B cell receptor pathway inhibitors.
