In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Fasano et al. (2007) investigate the role of Bmi-1 in neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo. They find a progressively increasing requirement for Bmi-1 function in stem cells during development that, surprisingly, seems to involve regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21.
