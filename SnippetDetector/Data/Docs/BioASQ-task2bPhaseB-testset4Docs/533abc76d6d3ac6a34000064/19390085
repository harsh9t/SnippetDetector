The molecular mechanisms that regulate the age-induced increase of p16(INK4a) expression associated with decreased beta-cell proliferation and regeneration are not well understood. We report that in aged islets, derepression of the Ink4a/Arf locus is associated with decreased Bmi-1 binding, loss of H2A ubiquitylation, increased MLL1 recruitment, and a concomitant increase in H3K4 trimethylation. During beta-cell regeneration these histone modifications are reversed resulting in reduced p16(INK4a) expression and increased proliferation. We suggest that PcG and TrxG proteins impart a combinatorial code of histone modifications on the Ink4a/Arf locus to control beta-cell proliferation during aging and regeneration.
