SECIS elements form stem-loop structures in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of eukaryotic mRNAs that encode selenoproteins. These elements direct incorporation of selenocysteine at UGA codons, provided the SECIS element lies a sufficient distance from the UGA. The cDNAs encoding skeletal muscle selenoprotein W from human, rhesus monkey, sheep, rat, and mouse contained highly similar SECIS elements that retained important features common to all known SECIS elements. Comparative analysis of these SECIS elements showed that in some regions both predicted secondary structure and nucleotide sequences were conserved, in other areas secondary structure was maintained using different primary sequence, and in still other portions, base pairing was not conserved. The rodent and sheep selenoprotein W mRNAs used UGA as a stop codon and as a selenocysteine codon. Thus, UGA specified both selenocysteine incorporation and termination in a single mRNA. The selenoprotein W SECIS elements contained an additional highly conserved base-paired stem that may prevent inappropriate selenocysteine incorporation at the UGA stop codons.
