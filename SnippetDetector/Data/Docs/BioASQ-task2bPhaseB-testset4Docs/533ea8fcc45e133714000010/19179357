SUMMARY: Selenoproteins contain the 21st amino acid selenocysteine which is encoded by an inframe UGA codon, usually read as a stop. In eukaryotes, its co-translational recoding requires the presence of an RNA stem-loop structure, the SECIS element in the 3 untranslated region of (UTR) selenoprotein mRNAs. Despite little sequence conservation, SECIS elements share the same overall secondary structure. Until recently, the lack of a significantly high number of selenoprotein mRNA sequences hampered the identification of other potential sequence conservation. In this work, the web-based tool SECISaln provides for the first time an extensive structure-based sequence alignment of SECIS elements resulting from the well-defined secondary structure of the SECIS RNA and the increased size of the eukaryotic selenoproteome. We have used SECISaln to improve our knowledge of SECIS secondary structure and to discover novel, conserved nucleotide positions and we believe it will be a useful tool for the selenoprotein and RNA scientific communities. AVAILABILITY: SECISaln is freely available as a web-based tool at http://genome.crg.es/software/secisaln/.

Selenoproteins are a diverse family of proteins characterized by the presence of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine (ec or ). elenocysteine is co-translationally inserted into the growing polypeptide chain in response to , otherwise read as a stop codon. he correct recoding of  to ec requires the presence of a stem-loop structure, the  element in the 3 untranslated region () of selenoprotein gene transcripts. ccordingly, the presence of a suitable  element has been used in many studies as a tool for the computational prediction of novel selenoproteins (astellano et al., 2001; ryukov et al., 1999; escure et al.; 1999) and a specialized tool for  prediction, earch (ryukov et al., 2003), has already been described and has been widely used.Selenoproteins are a diverse family of proteins characterized by the presence of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec or U). Selenocysteine is co-translationally inserted into the growing polypeptide chain in response to UGA, otherwise read as a stop codon. The correct recoding of UGA to Sec requires the presence of a stem-loop structure, the SECIS element in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of selenoprotein gene transcripts. Accordingly, the presence of a suitable SECIS element has been used in many studies as a tool for the computational prediction of novel selenoproteins (Castellano et al., 2001; Kryukov et al., 1999; Lescure et al.; 1999) and a specialized tool for SECIS prediction, SECISearch (Kryukov et al., 2003), has already been described and has been widely used.

There are two types of eukaryotic es, type  and type  differing at the apex by the presence of the additional helix 3 in type  (agegaltier et al., 2000; rundner-ulemann et al., 1999; alczak et al., 1996 see ig. 1. lthough the  structure is conserved, there is little sequence conservation beyond the consecutive non-atson-rick base pairs / constituting the quartet, an unpaired  5 to  and a run of s in the apical loop/internal loop 2 (agegaltier et al., 2000; alczak et al., 1996). f these only the / of the quartet is invariable1 (e.g. uettner et al., 1996; obanov et al., 2007). ere, we describe aln, a web-based tool that creates structure-based alignments of an extensive dataset of eukaryotic  sequences. ts implementation led us to uncover novel, conserved sequence elements.

Saln will predict a  element in the query sequence, split it into its constituent parts and align these against a precompiled database of eukaryotic  elements. he user can choose whether the database sequences are sorted by protein family or by species, thereby offering the possibility of comparing the submitted sequence to other, known es. n addition, aln returns a graphical image of the predicted structure of the user-submitted sequence as well as a multiple structural alignment of all  elements of that type already present in the database. aln uses earch for the  prediction step, described in detail in (ryukov et al. (2003) and is not intended as a replacement for earch. ur patterns and free-energy cutoffs are not stringent and will result in a high false positive rate if used to identify novel  elements. deally, aln should be used on sequences which are known to contain a  element, and its main application is the detailed characterization of structural features in the identified  elements, through the multiple structural comparison to other known  elements.SECISaln will predict a SECIS element in the query sequence, split it into its constituent parts and align these against a precompiled database of eukaryotic SECIS elements.

Ideally, SECISaln should be used on sequences which are known to contain a SECIS element, and its main application is the detailed characterization of structural features in the identified SECIS elements, through the multiple structural comparison to other known SECIS elements.

In addition to being the first structural alignment tool for  elements, aln also provides the largest available, manually curated collection of eukaryotic es. ur  collection was built by searching for homologs of all known eukaryotic selenoproteins in s efseq m. RNA and TIGRs EGO databases. We ran TBLASTN searches using the human (when available, other species when not) selenoproteins as queries. We then extracted the relevant mRNA sequence from the database and identified its SECIS element. We also manually added insect SECIS sequences that had been previously identified (Chapple and GuigΓ³, 2008), but which are not yet present in mRNA databases. This process resulted in a collection of 62 type I and 224 type II SECISes, a clear indication that type II constitute the major part of SECIS elements. Interestingly, although all selenoprotein families had a type II SECIS in at least one species, SelO, SelT, MsrA, DI2, SelS, 15kDa, TR3, SelI, Gpx3 and TR2 had type II SECISes in all species investigated. GPx1 and DI1 had type I SECISes in all species except Danio rerio.

Analyzing the structural alignments produced by aln provided a more detailed picture of  structural features. or instance the length of helix 2, which was previously set to 14 bp, is less constrained and ranges in fact from 11 bp to 16 bp. aln also highlighted previously unknown conserved residues in eukaryotic  elements (see upplementary able 1), which can be summarized as a new consensus core sequence for eukaryotic  elements as shown in igure 1. ost striking of these is an overrepresentation of  at position 1 (3 to abcd) and a corresponding overrepresentation of  ( or ) at position 1. e also observed a clear overrepresentation of  in type  elements, and  in type  at position β�’4. his is particularly surprising since no cross-species sequence conservation has ever been observed five to the quartet, with the exception of the conserved , and may be connected to the 2- contacts observed in this area (l. Γ©ry et al., 2007; Fletcher et al., 2001)
