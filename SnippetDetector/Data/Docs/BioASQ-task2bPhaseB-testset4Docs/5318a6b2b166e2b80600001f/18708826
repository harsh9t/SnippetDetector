Antiplatelet therapy for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) has undergone dramatic changes and improvements. Aspirin remains the first-line antiplatelet drug for clinical use. Newer platelet inhibitors such as the thienopyridine agents, ticlopidine and clopidogrel, have also been shown to be effective in treating CAD. There have been ongoing efforts to evaluate newer antiplatelet drugs, with the potential to improve clinical efficacy and safety. Some of the more promising antiplatelet agents include new adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists such as prasugrel, cangrelor, and ticagrelor (AZD6140). In addition, a new thromboxane receptor antagonist, NCX-4016, a newly discovered protease-activated receptor antagonist that targets thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and anti-von Willebrand factor aptamers show tremendous promise in refining antiplatelet therapy by targeting different receptors and molecules.
