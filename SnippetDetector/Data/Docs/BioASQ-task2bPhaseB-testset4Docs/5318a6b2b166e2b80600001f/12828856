The clinical use of oligonucleotide (ODN) therapeutics has been hampered by their limited ability to penetrate intact cells. To identify ODN properties that would facilitate cellular uptake, we developed a repetitive selection procedure using an ODN library containing at least 10(14) different molecules and human B lymphoma cells as a target. Natural phosphodiester single-stranded DNA ODNs (R-aptamers) were obtained after 10 rounds of selection. A common feature in the R-aptamers was guanine-rich 3' terminal sequences, and many also contained potential immunostimulatory (ISS) CpG sequence motifs. Two R-aptamers (R10-60 and D-R15-8) with the predominant shared characteristics were selected for further study on primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, which are well known to be difficult to transfect and activate. Flow cytometry analysis of the CLL cells demonstrated that the fluorochrome-labeled R-aptamers were internalized much more efficiently than nonselected random sequence ODN. Studies on sequence modifications indicated that efficient uptake required ODN multimerization, that was promoted by guanine-rich sequences at the 3' terminus. In addition, CLL cells that were exposed to the aggregating R-aptamers containing CpG motifs were strongly activated, as indicated by upregulation of CD40 levels as compared to cells treated with nonaggregating CpG R-aptamers. Together, these findings suggest that the sequence compositions in R-aptamers that promote multimerization and contain optimal ISS CpG motifs facilitate the delivery of ISS-ODN to CLL cells and enhance the activation of these cells.
