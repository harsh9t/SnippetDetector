We studied the enrichment and distribution of the histone variant mH2A1 in the condensed inactive X (Xi) chromosome. By using highly specific antibodies against mH2A1 and stable HEK 293 cell lines expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mH2A1 or GFP-H2A, we found that the Xi chromosome contains approximately 1.5-fold more mH2A1 than the autosomes. To determine the in vivo distribution of mH2A1 along the X chromosome, we used a native chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip technique. DNA isolated from mH2A1-immunoprecipitated nucleosomes from either male or female mouse liver were hybridized to tiling microarrays covering 5 kb around most promoters or the entire X chromosome. The data show that mH2A1 is uniformly distributed across the entire Xi chromosome. Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes. Our results indicate a potential role for macroH2A in large-scale chromosome structure and genome stability.
