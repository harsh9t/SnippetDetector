Histone-lysine acetylation is a vital chromatin post-translational modification involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Bromodomains bind acetylated lysines, acting as readers of the histone-acetylation code. Competitive inhibitors of this interaction have antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. With 57 distinct bromodomains known, the discovery of subtype-selective inhibitors of the histone-bromodomain interaction is of great importance. We have identified the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety as a novel acetyl-lysine bioisostere, which displaces acetylated histone-mimicking peptides from bromodomains. Using X-ray crystallographic analysis, we have determined the interactions responsible for the activity and selectivity of 4-substituted 3,5-dimethylisoxazoles against a selection of phylogenetically diverse bromodomains. By exploiting these interactions, we have developed compound 4d, which has IC(50) values of <5 μM for the bromodomain-containing proteins BRD2(1) and BRD4(1). These compounds are promising leads for the further development of selective probes for the bromodomain and extra C-terminal domain (BET) family and CREBBP bromodomains.

Introduction
enetic information is encoded in  by the specific linear sequence of its bases. he expression of this information is regulated by protein scaffolds that are capable of reading the complex code of post-translational modifications that occur on chromatin. cetylation of histones lysine residues is one such essential component in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.(1) dditionally, recent proteomics studies have demonstrated that lysine acetylation occurs in over 1750 cellular proteins involved in diverse roles such as cell cycle, splicing, nuclear transport, and actin nucleation.(2) ysine acetylation on histones and other proteins is effected by the dynamic interplay of acetyltransferase () and deacetylase () enzymes, which is analogous to the regulation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases.
romodomains are a family of conserved β�110 amino acid modules that bind selectively to acetylated lysines present in proteins, notably histones,(3) and are thereby thought to participate in deciphering the histone code.(4) romodomains have been classified into several distinct subgroups according to the function of their parent protein: (i) histone acetyltransferases (s), including , 5, , and 250; (ii) in components of -dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes such as wi2/nf2; and (iii) the  (bromodomain and extra -terminal domain) family, a class of transcriptional regulators carrying tandem bromodomains and an extra terminal domain.(5)
lthough the biological roles of most bromodomains in the human genome remain elusive, those that have been characterized are fundamental. or example, the  bromodomain-containing protein () 4 plays a key role in several cellular processes, including mitosis.(6) xpression levels of 4 correlate with breast cancer survival rates,(7) and in a subset of malignant squamous carcinomas, the -terminal bromodomains of 4 are fused in frame to the  gene giving rise to extremely aggressive tumor growth.(8) nockdown experiments have implicated 4 in the transcriptional regulation of viruses such as (9) and ,(10) as well as the degradation of .(11) 4 was also shown to be required for transcriptional coactivation of -, regulating the transcription of -b-dependent pro-inflammatory target genes.(12)  second -family protein, the testis-specific , is essential for male germ cell differentiation in selective domain knockout mice that were viable but sterile.(13)
he development of small molecule inhibitors of bromodomain binding to histones and other acetyl-lysine-containing proteins is in its infancy. eakly potent small molecule ligands of the c. AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CREBBP) bromodomain, discovered by NMR screening of acetyl-lysine (KAc) mimics, have been shown to modulate p53 stability and function in response to DNA damage in cells.(14) More recently, a 4-hydroxyphenylazobenzenesulfonic acid derivative was shown to bind to the CREBBP bromodomain, with KD = 19 ΞΌM, and consequently blocks p53-dependent apoptosis in cardiomyocytes under DNA-damage stress.(15)
Ligands have also been developed for the BET family of bromodomains. A benzimidazole-derived BRD2(1) ligand with KD = 28 ΞΌM reduced the transcription of BRD2-dependent genes.(16) Antiproliferative effects against a number of cell lines have been claimed in a patent for a series of thienotriazolodiazepine BRD2/3/4 blockers with nanomolar in vitro peptide displacement activity.(17) The structurally related (+)-JQ1 (Figure 1A), recently characterized as a BET-family selective chemical probe, shows specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models.(18) In addition, a recently identified BET bromodomain blocker (I-BET, Figure 1B) suppressed lipopolysaccharide-inducible genes in macrophages and showed anti-inflammatory effects in mice.(19) This work demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting KAc binding to bromodomains with small molecules that occupy the well-defined KAc-binding pocket. It is possible that targeting this pocket might prove more tractable than developing inhibitors of catalytic activity in certain enzymes. In addition, small molecule inhibition of bromodomainβ€“protein interactions might elicit subtly different pharmacological responses to the inhibition of the catalytic domain of the same protein.(20)

(D) The concept employed in the design of the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole-based bromodomain inhibitors.The findings outlined above demonstrate clearly the need for systematic generation of high affinity subfamily selective bromodomain-binding small molecules that can be used as chemical probes to explore further the roles of individual bromodomains. These molecules will provide complementary data to studies using knockdown, peptide and antibody approaches, and will enable prediction of the likely phenotypes of eventual small molecule drugs. As part of our ongoing goal to generate cell-penetrant chemical probes for bromodomains, we have previously developed bromodomainβ€“histone peptide binding assays to allow the identification of fragment and small molecule ligands.(21) Herein, we describe the use of these assays, together with a structure-based design approach, to identify and develop the structureβ€“activity relationships (SAR) of a novel series of 3,5-dimethylisoxazole-containing bromodomainβ€“histone binding inhibitors.
We demonstrate that the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety is an effective KAc mimic and show how differential substitution of the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole core gives derivatives that bind with some selectivity and useful affinity to either the first bromodomain of human BRD4 [BRD4(1)] or the bromodomain of human CREBBP.

Results and iscussion
n the course of our work, we discovered that the solvent -methyl pyrrolidinone () interacts with the c-binding pocket of a range of bromodomains, showing weak affinity but, because of its low molecular weight, high ligand efficiency (0.30β€“0.53, see upporting nformation, able 1), with 50 values ranging from 34 m. M for the bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 2B (BAZ2B) to 2.3 mM for CREBBP.(21) During subsequent studies on methyl-bearing heterocycles, we purchased and tested the dihydroquinazolinone-containing 3,5-dimethylisoxazole derivative 1 (Figure 1C) and observed unexpectedly low IC50 values of β�Ό3 ΞΌM against the first bromodomain of BRD2 [BRD2(1)] and β�Ό7 ΞΌM against BRD4(1). Docking studies suggested that two binding modes were possible for this compound, with either the dihydroquinazolinone or 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety acting as a KAc bioisostere (data not shown). To explore the possibility that the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole might occupy the KAc-binding pocket, we obtained an X-ray crystal structure of the complex between human BRD4(1) and 1.
The X-ray crystal structure of the BRD4(1) complex was solved at 1.98 Γ… (Figure 2A, PDB ID: 3SVF). It demonstrated that the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole was indeed acting as a KAc bioisostere, accepting a hydrogen bond from the conserved N residue within the binding pocket [N140 in BRD4(1)], which mimics the key interaction made with the carbonyl oxygen of KAc. Additionally, we observed additional unexplained electron density at the 4-position of the dihydroquinazolinone that was interpreted as a substitution of one hydrogen atom by an ethylene glycol unit (Figure 2B). As dihydroquinazolinones are liable to benzylic oxidation under laboratory conditions (Supporting Information, Figure S1),(22) we hypothesized that this product 2 might arise from oxidation at this position to form the corresponding iminium species, followed by the addition of ethylene glycol, which is present in the crystallization buffer (see Supporting Information, Figure S1 for mass spectrometry analysis). Interestingly, only one enantiomer was observed in the X-ray crystal structure; the ethylene glycol unit attached to the stereogenic center occupies a hydrophobic groove formed by W81 and P82 from the ZA loop and I146 and M149 from helix C. Occupation of this site by the 4-chlorophenyl substituent of (+)-JQ1 and I-BET (Figure 1A,B) is believed to contribute to the selectivity of the these compounds for the BET subfamily over other bromodomains since a similar groove is not available in other bromodomains (Figure 2C).(18) In addition, we observed that a sample of 1 displayed significant cytotoxicity in the HeLa human cell line, while (+)-JQ1 showed no cytotoxicity over the same concentration range (Supporting Information, Figure S2). Therefore, the development of analogues that do not possess a readily oxidized benzylic methylene unit, but that could form interactions with this groove, was pursued. The mono- and di-meta-substituted 3,5-dimethyl-4-phenylisoxazole scaffolds (3aβ€“d and 4aβ€“d) were chosen to allow extension from the aromatic core in two directions (Figure 1B). Initial docking studies suggested that a single meta-substituent would occupy a position similar to that of the ethylene glycol moiety of 2 (Supporting Information, Figure S3A). A second meta-substituent would be directed into a groove (referred to by Nicodeme et al.(19a) and Chung et al.(19b) as the ZA channel) defined by W81 on one side and L92 on the other (Supporting Information, Figure S3A). Consequently, the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole derivatives 3aβ€“d and 4aβ€“d were selected as target molecules that contain a range of substituents to enable exploration of the KAc-binding pocket of the bromodomains.

(C) Overlay of crystal structures of 2 (carbon = yellow) and (+)-JQ1 (carbon = orange, PDB ID: 3MXF) bound to human BRD4(1), showing that the ethylene glycol unit binds in the same region as the chlorophenyl moiety of (+)-JQ1. The images were generated and structure alignment conducted using PyMOL.The syntheses of 3aβ€“d and 4aβ€“d are shown in Schemes 1β€“3. Initial work focused on the direct arylation of 3,5-dimethylisoxazole using Pd-catalyzed Cβ€“H bond activation.(23) While this reaction proceeded well with bromobenzene 5, lower yields were obtained on reaction with 6 and 10 (Supporting Information, Scheme S1). Furthermore, the reaction has been reported to be less successful with electron-rich aryl bromides.(23) Conversely, Molander et al. have demonstrated that potassium heteroaryltrifluoroborates react efficiently with both electron-rich and electron-deficient aryl halides, with low catalyst loadings and minimal protodeboronation.(24) Therefore, we prepared potassium (3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)trifluoroborate 8 from (3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)boronic acid.(24) Coupling of 8 to commercially available aryl bromides 5 and 6, and aryl bromide 7 (easily prepared from 3-bromophenol,(25)Supporting Information, Scheme S2) afforded 3,5-dimethyl-4-phenylisoxazole 3a and the 3β€²-substituted 3,5-dimethyl-4-phenylisoxazoles 3b and 3c in excellent yields (Scheme 1). Although the coupling reactions did proceed when conducted with (3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)boronic acid (data not shown), the yields observed were lower than those in the route described above.
Scheme 1Synthesis of the 3β€²-Substituted 3,5-Dimethyl-4-phenylisoxazole Derivatives 3aβ€“cConditions: (a) R = H: Na2CO3, Pd(OAc)2, RuPhos, EtOH, 85 Β°C, 4 h, 85%.

R = OEt: Na2CO3, Pd(OAc)2, RuPhos, EtOH, 85 Β°C, 2 h, 87%.The 3β€²,5β€²-disubstituted 3,5-dimethyl-4-phenylisoxazoles 4aβ€“c were prepared from 3-bromo-5-hydroxybenzoic acid 9 (Scheme 2). Alkylation of 9 afforded the ethyl ester 10, which was coupled to 8, yielding 4a. Subsequent LiOH-mediated hydrolysis furnished the carboxylic acid 4b. Alternatively, the ethyl ester of 10 was converted to the acetyl group via the Weinreb amide 12 in three steps; coupling, under the same conditions employed above, yielded the isoxazole 4c. The methyl ketones 3b and 4c were converted to the racemic secondary alcohols 3d and 4d by reduction of the ketone with NaBH4 (Scheme 3).

R = OEt: 81%.To enable accurate comparison with our new compounds, a sample of 1 was resynthesized (Supporting Information, Scheme S3). Biological evaluation of 1 was conducted using freshly prepared DMSO solutions to minimize the possibility of oxidation (see Supporting Information for details).
To determine whether the compounds inhibited bromodomainβ€“histone binding, we utilized a peptide displacement assay based on AlphaScreen technology.(21) For the first bromodomain of BRD2 [BRD2(1)] and BRD4(1), a histone H4 peptide acetylated at K5, 8, 12, and 16 was employed, while for CREBBP an H3 peptide acetylated at K56 was used. IC50 values for compounds 1, 3aβ€“d, and 4aβ€“d are shown in Table 1 (doseβ€“response curves for 1, compounds 4b and 4d in BRD4(1), BRD2(1), and CREBBP are shown in Supporting Information, Figure S4). With the exception of 3a, all compounds inhibited BRD4(1) and BRD2(1) with IC50 β‰¤ 50 ΞΌM, the most potent compounds showing low micromolar activity. Introduction of an ethoxy substituent at R2 increases potency against BRD4(1) and BRD2(1). A variety of substituents at R1 are well tolerated, with the exception of R1 = CO2H in which the positioning of a negatively charged substituent in a hydrophobic site is likely to disfavor binding. IC50 values were generally higher against CREBBP, except for 4b (R1 = CO2H) where the IC50 for CREBBP was lower than that for BRD4(1) and similar to that for BRD2(1). Gratifyingly, 4b and 4d did not show any cytotoxicity in a human cell line (Supporting Information, Figure S2).

Ranges in parentheses represent 95% confidence intervals resulting from sigmoidal curve fitting to duplicate data. n.d. = not determined.To investigate the selectivity of these compounds against other bromodomains, we employed a binding assay based on protein stability shift (Table 2).(26) Of the compounds that produced substantial changes in melting temperature (Ξ”Tmobs), most displayed selectivity for BET bromodomains. However, 4bβ€“d also produce an appreciable Ξ”Tmobs with CREBBP, in agreement with the IC50 values. Indeed, 4b showed selectivity, albeit modest, for CREBBP over the BET bromodomains.

Heat map shows relative Ξ”Tmobs; red indicates large Ξ”Tmobs, and green indicates small Ξ”Tmobs. Experiments were carried out in duplicate; average values are reported.In order to confirm that the dimethylisoxazole moiety was acting as a KAc mimic and to elucidate structureβ€“activity profiles for these compounds, we obtained cocrystal structures of BRD4(1) with 4d and the CREBBP bromodomain with 4b (Figures 3 and 4).

Image generated using PyMOL. (B) Schematic representation of the key interactions formed between 4b and the bromodomain of human CREBBP.The costructure of 4d bound to BRD4(1) was obtained at 1.68 Γ… resolution (PDB ID: 3SVG). Globally, the ligand-bound and apo structures (PDB ID: 2OSS) are very similar, with a rmsd of 0.17. This structure confirms that 4d binds with the dimethylisoxazole oriented into the KAc-binding pocket as anticipated by our docking studies (Supporting Information, Figure S3B). It is predicted that the isoxazole oxygen atom forms the expected hydrogen bond with the amine group of the conserved N140 (green, Figure 3A). The isoxazole nitrogen atom interacts with the phenol group of Y97 via the structured water molecule A (Figure 3B).
Although 4d was synthesized as a racemate, the electron density for this compound implies that the (R)-enantiomer crystallizes preferentially with BRD4(1). The secondary alcohol forms a network of hydrogen bonds with water molecules Bβ€“E, which interact with D144, D145, and the carbonyl oxygen atom of N140. The methyl group attached to the secondary alcohol binds within the hydrophobic pocket (pocket 2, Figure 3B) that is defined by I146, M149, and W81, the latter forming part of the WPF shelf (described by Nicodeme et al. as W81, P82, and F83).(19a) This is the same pocket that binds the ethylene glycol unit of 2 (Supporting Information, Figure S3C) and the chlorophenyl moieties of I-BET and (+)-JQ1 (Supporting Information, Figure S3D). The ethyl ether binds within the ZA channel (pocket 3, Figure 3B) that accommodates the thiophene moiety of (+)-JQ1 and the methylated phenol of I-BET. Therefore, analysis of the X-ray crystal structure of 4d in complex with BRD4(1) shows that this compound is forming interactions in many of the same regions as (+)-JQ1 and I-BET, perhaps explaining how a compound with relatively low molecular weight (261) still shows good affinity for BRD4(1) and reasonable selectivity for the BET subfamily of bromodomains. Indeed, 4d has ligand efficiencies of 0.39 for BRD4(1) and 0.43 for BRD2(1), which compare favorably with the value of 0.32 for (+)-JQ1 at BRD4(1) (see Supporting Information, Table S1 for details of ligand efficiency calculations). These ligand efficiencies suggest that compound 4d is a promising lead for the development of BET bromodomain ligands that display potencies similar to those of (+)-JQ1 and I-BET but with lower molecular mass than those of these compounds.
Identification of CREBBP bromodomain inhibitors has so far proved challenging, with only two studies identifying small-molecule ligands for this bromodomain.14,15 Therefore, given that compound 4b shows some selectivity for CREBBP bromodomain over other subfamilies, the costructure of 4b bound to the CREBBP bromodomain was obtained at 1.80 Γ… resolution (PDB ID: 3SVH). Compound 4b, which possesses a carboxylic acid group in place of the secondary alcohol of 4d, binds to the CREBBP bromodomain in an orientation similar to that adopted by 4d when binding to BRD4(1). The dimethylisoxazole moiety again acts as a KAc mimic and occupies the KAc-binding pocket. Likewise, the isoxazole oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond with the amine group of N1168 (equivalent to N140 in BRD4(1), green, Figure 4A). The isoxazole nitrogen atom also interacts with the phenol group of Y1125 [equivalent to Y97 in BRD4(1)] via the structured water molecule A. The dihedral angle between the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole and the phenyl ring of compounds 2, 4b, and 4d differs in the crystal structures obtained. However, this angle is observed as 50Β° in the case of 2 [BRD4(1)], 45Β° in the case of 4d [BRD4(1)] and 39Β° in the case of 4b (CREBBP), which are all similar to the angle of 40Β° in the predicted lowest energy conformation (Supporting Information, Figure S5), suggesting that these compounds can bind in the KAc-binding pocket without the introduction of significant strain. The oxygen atom of the ethoxy group in 4b forms a hydrogen bond with structured water G, which interacts with the turn-forming residues 1110β€“1113. Interestingly, this structured water molecule is also present in BRD4(1), but the orientation of the ethoxy group in compound 4d is such that it does not form a similar hydrogen bond, at least within crystals. Residue W81, which plays a key role in defining the binding site in BRD4(1), is not present in CREBBP. The equivalent amino acid is L1109, which although also hydrophobic, is oriented away from the binding site, providing more space in this region. R1173 provides a basic rim to the binding pocket, which is not present in BRD4. Although these residues are not in direct contact with the carboxylic acid of 4b, it is possible that a weak electrostatic interaction might explain, at least in part, the preferential binding of this compound to CREBBP over the BET bromodomains. It should be noted that CREBBP crystallized as a dimer, with a second molecule of 4b bound at the dimer interface. This phenomenon is thought to result from the relatively high concentration of 4b used in obtaining the structure and is unlikely to be responsible for this compoundβ€™s ability to prevent the CREBBPβ€“KAc interaction.
In summary, we have discovered an entirely new chemical class of bromodomain ligands comprising low-molecular weight 4-phenyl-3,5-dimethylisoxazole derivatives. Using structure-based approaches, we have demonstrated that the unstable dihydroquinazolinone moiety of lead 1 can be replaced with a single aromatic ring without significant loss of affinity. Most of the resultant 4-phenyl-3,5-dimethylisoxazoles are selective ligands for the BET family of bromodomains. However, compounds 4bβ€“d produced a marked increase in Tmobs for CREBBP, suggesting that 3,5-dimethylisoxazoles are also useful leads for selective inhibitors of CREBBP-KAc interactions, which have proved elusive to date. The costructures that we have obtained demonstrate that the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety acts as a KAc bioisostere in two classes of bromodomains, corroborating the binding data and IC50 values presented. As few chemical classes of small-molecule inhibitors of bromodomainβ€“histone interactions have been described previously,15β�’20 this work represents a significant advance in the SAR of these important proteins.
In conclusion, we have exploited the serendipitous discovery of a KAc mimic to develop a novel class of compounds that inhibit bromodomainβ€“histone interactions. Crystallographic analysis and rational design have provided insight into the structural requirements for potent, selective BRD4(1) and CREBBP bromodomain ligands. These compounds are invaluable leads in the continuing search for chemical probes of epigenetic targets.

Thus, for the purposes of SAR, data in Table 1 is given from a single assay, with intraexperimental variability expressed as 95% confidence intervals resulting from sigmoidal curve fitting to duplicate data.Cytotoxicity AssayHeLa cells were subcultured in DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. 20000 cells per well were seeded into a 96 well plate. After 24 h of incubation at 37 Β°C, the medium was changed, and compounds were applied at final concentrations of 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 ΞΌM. The cells were incubated for 24 or 48 h, after which time the medium was changed, and MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to the plate. After 2 h of incubation at 37 Β°C, the medium was replaced with 200 ΞΌL of DMSO to solubilize the formazan crystals. After a further 15 min, absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer. Experiments were performed in triplicate on the same plate.
