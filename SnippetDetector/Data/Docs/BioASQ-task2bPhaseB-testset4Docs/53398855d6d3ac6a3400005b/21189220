Double bromodomain proteins bind to acetylated lysines in histones, bringing associated histone modification and nucleosome remodeling activity to chromatin. The ability of bromodomain regulators to alter chromatin status and control gene expression has long been appreciated to be important in the development of certain human cancers. However, bromodomain proteins have now been found also to be critical, non-redundant players in diverse, non-malignant phenotypes, directing transcriptional programs that control adipogenesis, energy metabolism and inflammation. The fact that such different processes are functionally linked by the same molecular machinery suggests a common epigenetic basis to understand and interpret the origins of several important co-morbidities, such as asthma or cancer that occurs in obesity, and complex inflammatory diseases like cardiovascular disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and insulin resistance that may be built on a common pro-inflammatory foundation.
