Identification of a chemical probe for bromo and extra C-terminal bromodomain inhibition through optimization of a fragment-derived hit.

<abstract>
The posttranslational modification of chromatin through acetylation at selected histone lysine residues is governed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The significance of this subset of the epigenetic code is interrogated and interpreted by an acetyllysine-specific protein-protein interaction with bromodomain reader modules. Selective inhibition of the bromo and extra C-terminal domain (BET) family of bromodomains with a small molecule is feasible, and this may represent an opportunity for disease intervention through the recently disclosed antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties of such inhibitors. Herein, we describe the discovery and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a novel, small-molecule chemical probe for BET family inhibition that was identified through the application of structure-based fragment assessment and optimization techniques. This has yielded a potent, selective compound with cell-based activity (PFI-1) that may further add to the understanding of BET family function within the bromodomains.

Introduction
romodomains are protein interaction modules
that recognize the
µ--acetylation state of specific lysine residues found within
histone tails and other proteins.1 istones
are lysine-rich proteins that, left unmodified, are highly basic in
character. odification of these hallmark lysine residues through
acetylation or iterative methylation causes changes in the structural
and physicochemical properties of the histone protein,2,3 affecting the structure of nucleosomes that organize the proteinβ€“
hybrid arrangement. lteration of these µ-2 sites
on lysine represents the protein-held part of the epigenetic code
within the chromatin of each cell nucleus. he acetylation level of
these initially basic residues is controlled by the action of histone
acetyltransferases (s) and histone deacetylases (s); however,
the significance of these modulations is relayed by the bromodomains
and their histone tail recognition function.4 he consequences of this acetylation reading process may trigger
further remodeling at the epigenetically modifiable sites within the
protein or  components of chromatin, ultimately manifesting themselves
in transcriptional activity control.5 he
number of proteins susceptible to lysine µ-2 acetylation
state changes reaches into the thousands, and these have been shown
to play a diverse range of functions.6 romodomains
are the only modules that can specifically recognize acetylated linear
motifs. hey are found within large multidomain nuclear proteins tasked
with controlling processes such as methyl transfer, transcription
coactivation, and motor protein (helicase) activity. here are 61
bromodomains in the human proteome and these are further classified
into eight families, one of which is the bromodomain and extra -terminal
domain () family.7  family function
has been studied through protein expression quantification or knockdown
experiments of individual  family members. his has highlighted
the control of processes that mediate cancer,8 inflammation,9 and viral infection,10 among others. his renders the bromodomains
within the  protein family attractive targets for drug discovery,
at least in the context of potential efficacy.1 hemical probes against bromodomain families, or perhaps in time
highly selective inhibitors of each of the 61 family members, will
be useful tools in fully establishing the role of these proteins.
hemical probes that can help validate the potential efficacy and,
of equal importance, safety of bromodomain inhibition will be of great
utility in this emerging target class. he first chemotypes for 
family inhibitors have recently been disclosed by members of this
group11 and others.12,13 he structurally related triazolodiazepine compounds (+)-1 1 and -762 2 (igure 1) are the most potent (nanomolar),  family-selective, and cell-active
 family inhibitors disclosed thus far. -762 has recently entered
clinical trials for  midline carcinoma.14
igure 1irst-generation
 family inhibitors.(+)-1 1 showed anti-cancer activity
in patient-derived
xenografts,11 while -762 exhibited
anti-inflammatory effects in mice.12 
small number of orthogonal chemotypes have also been recently disclosed.
onway and co-workers15 (compounds 3 and 4, igure 2) and
rinjha and co-workers16 (-151, 5, igure 2) have independently described
3,5-dimethylisoxazole as a viable acetyllysine mimetic in identifying
novel  binders. amborough and hung and co-workers17 have also described fragment-based approaches to identifying
novel chemotypes (such as compound 6, igure 2) through a designed selection of fragments with
the potential to be -acetyllysine mimetics. his
yielded novel hits of moderate efficiency in this proof-of-principle
study.

Results and iscussion
espite the proteinβ€“protein
interaction nature of the histone
and its associated bromodomain reader, the pockets for binding acetylated
lysine within the bromodomain proteins are sufficiently deep and defined
to potentially accommodate inhibitory small molecules with high affinity
and efficiency.7 iven this potential,
and the knowledge that acetylated lysine is the endogenous binding
substrate for the pocket, we (and others)15,17 embarked on screening fragment-sized potential acetyllysine mimetics
that may be weak, nonselective pan-bromodomain binders. uch like
starting points for onway and co-workers15 and hung and co-workers,17 3,4-dihydro-3methyl-2(1)-quinazolinones seemed like attractive fragments to test
this hypothesis. ommercially available 3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2(1)-quinazolinone 7 [also identified by hung
as a bromodomain fragment, leading to a 2(1) cocrystal deposition
in the rotein ata ank, accession code 49]17 and its
6-brominated equivalent 8 both proved to be active in
a peptide displacement biochemical assay (lpha. Screen format) in the
30β€“90 ΞΌM range against BRD4 and cyclic AMP response binding
element binding protein (CREBBP).18 They
were not universally active in all bromodomains screened in this format,
with no activity seen at 200 ΞΌM in the BAZ2B and FALZ AlphaScreens.
With sub-30 ΞΌM pharmacology found in such small molecules,
the consequent ligand efficiencies19 of
>0.45 made for a very promising fragment-derived starting point.
The
3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone screening
lead 3 of Conway and co-workers15 (larger than conventional fragments) had the ambiguity of two potential
binding modes as it also contained a 3,5-dimethylisoxazole at the
6-position of the bicyclic core. This question was solved through
their first crystal structure in BRD4(1), which also showed the unexpected
oxidative incorporation of an ethylene glycol unit under the conditions
of crystallization. The compound to actually cocrystallize was found
to have the structure 4 (Figure 2). This structure showed the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole making the key
interaction at the base of the binding pocket, accepting a hydrogen
bond from Asn140. The 3,5-dimethylisoxazole was then optimized further
by Conway and co-workers,15 moving away
from the dihydroquinazolinone substructure found in the other half
of the original screening lead 3.
The smaller fragments 7 and 8 screened
in our campaign (featuring only H and Br at the coreβ€™s 6-position)
contained the cyclic urea as the only potential interaction functionality
available to Asn140. Chronologically in our study, a crystal structure
was first solved for 8 in CREBBP (not a BET family member).
This was followed up by crystallizing 8 in BRD4(1) in
a 1.63 Γ… structure, with no oxidative reactivity observed in
the crystallization protocol. Both the CREBBP and BRD4(1) crystal
structures for 8 showed the cyclic urea buried in the
pocket mimicking the acetyl NH of the endogenous histone lysine. It
also overlaid well in comparison to the BRD2(1) structure of 7 (PDB code 4A9E).17 This reconfirms that both binding
modes screened for by Conway are indeed possible and that 3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2(1H)-quinazolinones (6-brominated or not) are viable N-acetyl mimetics. The binding of 8 in BRD4
(1) (Figure 3) is characterized by a lipophilic
sandwich of the bicyclic core between residues Val87, Leu92, Leu94,
Tyr97 and Phe83, Ile146 in the protein. The cyclic urea meets Asn140
slightly offset with a hydrogen bond accepted by the urea carbonyl
from the amino acid carboxamide.
Figure 3Two views (A and C) of fragment hit 8 (B) cocrystallized
in BRD4(1).The binding mode implication of the cyclic urea
interaction with
Asn140 consequently presents the coreβ€™s brominated 6-position
in the general direction of solvent. The fragment hits 7 and 8, along with elucidation of the binding mode through
X-ray crystallography, efficiently directed design toward replacing
the bromine. The possibility for further productive interactions before
reaching solvent through extending a larger substituent from the 6-position
vector was the basis for the next round of molecular design. This
was also expected to improve selectivity for the BET family targets,
as greater variation in bromodomain protein structures is found away
from the N-acetyl binding residues. Although the
bromine atom represents a useful synthetic handle for many bond formations
in its own right, the unoccupied regions of the BRD protein in the
crystal structure suggested that inducing a pronounced kink in the
6-substituent directly off the template by design may be productive.
This was undertaken with access to a vacant lipohilic shelf (the so-called
WPF shelf) in mind at the opening of the pocket. Sulfonamides were
selected as a linker to explore this conformational plan. The availability
of the 6-brominated variant of the original 3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone suggests that reactivity of the unsubstituted
parent is directed through the 6-position during electrophilic aromatic
substitution reactions. To explore this proposed reactivity, two templates
were synthesized with sulfonamide hypotheses in mind. Commercially
available 7 was reacted with chlorosulfonic acid to produce
a 6-sulfonyl chloride template 9, and the known 6-nitro-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone 10 was resynthesized and then
reduced to the corresponding aniline 11 by hydrogenation.
The 6-sulfonyl chloride 9 and the 6-amino 11 synthesized as templates are novel compounds and make for attractive
monomers in their own right. In this program they were used as templates
in relatively small library designs where diversity was drawn from
the corresponding partner amine or sulfonyl chloride monomer sets,
held within the Pfizer company collection.

the 6-sulfonylchloride template were
profiled first. Pyrrolidine 12 and ethylamine 13 sulfonamides were 5β€“20-fold more active than the parent bromide.
The pyrrolidine sulfonamide 12 had a respectable ligand
efficiency of 0.38. The aniline-derived sulfonamide 14 was of similar activity, suggesting that this sulfonamide regioisomer
was not efficiently delivering the lipophilicity into the open WPF
shelf. Co-crystal structures of this series show alkylamine sulfonamides
(12 and 13) adopting highly comparable conformations
on binding, suggesting a tolerated sulfonamide replacement of the
6-bromide from fragment hit 8 (Figure 4). The inefficiency of the anilinic sulfonamide 14 is explained by the noticeable change in the SO2 group
conformation as a consequence of the phenyl group accommodating itself
on the shelf. The electron density on solving the crystal structure
also showed multiple conformations of similar occupancy for compound 14, suggesting that there was no single ideal binding mode
for the aryl group.

template 11 produced a series of compounds with significantly
improved
BRD4 activity. The abundance of readily available arylsulfonyl chlorides
weighted design in favor of aryl substituents. These compounds showed
a structureβ€“activity relationship (SAR) implying that they
were consistently accessing the lipophilic shelf as targeted in the
design hypothesis. A complementary synthesis of this type of compound
was also possible from the bromide fragment hit 8 through
palladium-catalyzed coupling of a primary arylsulfonamide (Scheme 1). The 10 examples (15β€“24) in Table 1 show BRD4(1) activity
(180 nMβ€“2.3 ΞΌM) across a selection of regioisomers of
both electron-withdrawing and -donating substituents on a phenyl ring.
Table 1Structureβ€“Activity Relationship
for BRD4 Activity within the SeriesaaIC50 values are expressed
with a 95% confidence interval derived from a minimum of two determinations.Four out of five of the most active compounds are
derived from
ortho-substituted arylsulfonyl chlorides, although the entire structureβ€“activity
relationship in Table 1 falls within 10-fold
of each other for compounds 15β€“24, regardless of the aryl group used. Given the position of this group,
now occupying the solvent-exposed WPF shelf, the key improvement in
activity has been attained primarily through the use of the reversed
sulfonamide linker. The binding of the now optimally orientated aryl
group is less sensitive to substitution patterns around the ring system.
Compound 17 (PFI-1) was selected as the nominated chemical
probe from the series for further profiling, as it struck the best
compromise between lipophilicity and pharmacology (Figure 5).
Figure 5Chemical probe selected
for profiling.A 1.52 Γ… cocrystal structure was obtained
for 17 in BRD4(1). Details of the crystal structure have
been deposited
in the PDB by members of this collaboration.20 The view shown in Figure 6 reveals a right-angled
turn in the molecule induced by the sulfonamide. The key interaction
with Asn140 is maintained and the urea carbonyl also makes a water-bridged
hydrogen-bond interaction with the phenolic OH of Tyr97.
Figure 6Two views (A
and B) of 17 (PFI-1) cocrystallized to
1.52 Γ… in BRD4(1).The most potent example 15 (2-Cl,
4-F) is >200-fold
more active than the fragment hit. The ligand efficiency of the initial
hit has been largely preserved in the series, and this indicates that
improvements in potency have been attained through the incorporation
of appropriately balanced lipophilicity. Beyond the expectation for
improved potency through functionalizing the 6-position of the template,
there was a BET family selectivity requirement for the novel series.
The fragment hits 7 and 8 were unselective
starting points for bromodomain selectivity with respect to CREBBP.
This is attributed to the fact that, due to their small size, the
fragments only occupy the region close to the conserved asparagine
residue common to all the bromodomains and are unable to exploit binding
site differences elsewhere within some of the more closely related
bromodomain proteins. As one of those most closely related non-BET
family bromodomains,7 CREBBP activity was
assessed on the more elaborated compound 17 from the
best sulfonamide series as a surrogate for broader bromdomain selectivity.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determined a KD of 49 ΞΌM for compound 17 in CREBBP. A Tm shift assay in CREBBP also showed a significantly
lower melting temperature for 17 of 1.7 Β°C at 10
ΞΌM. The BET family protein members showed Tm shifts of 2.1β€“6.5 Β°C for compound 17. Tm shifts for BAZ2B, PB1(5),
and PCAF were less than 1 Β°C as representative members of bromodomains
more distantly related to the BET family.21 Compound 17 is a selective chemical probe for the BET
bromodomains.
Having studied the activity of 17 as a representative
member of this BET family inhibitor series in biochemical and biophysical
assays, we further studied the compoundβ€™s credentials as a
chemical probe for broader pharmacological selectivity, a cell-based
inflammatory end-point assay, and rodent pharmacokinetics. The compound
showed <50% inhibition against a panel of 15 targets made up of
GPCRs, ion channels, and enzymes at 10 ΞΌM at Cerep and <20%
inhibition against 50 kinases at 1 ΞΌM at Invitrogen. Cell-based
activity was tested in an LPS challenge assay in PBMCs. Compound 17 had an EC50 of 1.89 ΞΌM (n = 6) for the inhibition of IL6 production from human blood mononuclear
cells stimulated by LPS. Rodent pharmacokinetics for 17 were studied in both rat (1 mg/kg iv and 2 mg/kg po) and mouse (2
mg/kg sc). After iv administration in the rat, the volume of distribution
was 1 L/kg and the plasma clearance was 18/mLΒ·minβ€“1Β·kgβ€“1, giving a 1 h half-life. The volume
of distribution is consistent with the physicochemical properties
of the compound, and the clearance is in line with estimates from
in vitro rat liver microsome (RLM) data (RLM t1/2 >120 min).22 After oral dosing
in the rat, the oral bioavailability was low at 32%. This is inconsistent
with the clearance and is believed to be due to suboptimal compound
solubility in the gut. This was further supported by the oral exposure
profile in rat, where the compound was present at a steady yet low
concentration (within 2-fold of the 1 h Cmax concentration of 120 ng/mL), out to the last time point of the study
(62 ng/mL at 7 h). This implies a depot of insoluble material in the
gut after oral dosing, gradually delivering low concentrations to
the systemic circulation over an extended time course. The compound
was 69% plasma protein-bound. The subcutaneous mouse pharmacokinetics
indicated exposure out to 4 h based on the 2 mg/kg dose, giving a Cmax of 58 ng/mL with a Tmax of 1 h and a half-life of approximately 2 h.
In conclusion, 17 is a novel chemical probe for the
BET family of bromodomain epigenetic reader proteins. With a molecular
weight of 347, a cLogP of 1.3, and TPSA of 96, 17 has
been optimized such that it has a low probability of polypharmacology
and conforms to most of the guidelines on the design of druglike molecules.23 It is a small, nonlipophilic, cell-penetrant
compound with selectivity for the BET family within the bromodomains.
It has rodent oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics in line with
its neutral template and associated solubility profile. Compound 17 is structurally orthogonal to the triazolodiazepines and
isoxazoles first discovered as selective BET family inhibitors and
so offers a complementary molecular approach for the use of chemical
probes in this field. It was discovered in two design cycles of less
than 250 compounds in total, based on an efficient fragment-based
starting point.
