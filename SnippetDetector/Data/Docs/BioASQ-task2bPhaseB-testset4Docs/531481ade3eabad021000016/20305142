BACKGROUND: The human hemoglobin switch (HbF-->HbA) takes place in the peri/post-natal period. In adult life, however, the residual HbF (<1%) may be partially reactivated by chemical inducers and/or cytokines such as the kit ligand (KL). MicroRNAs (miRs) play a pivotal role in normal hematopoiesis: downmodulation of miR-221/222 stimulates human erythropoietic proliferation through upmodulation of the kit receptor. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have explored the possible role of kit/KL in perinatal Hb switching by evaluating: i) the expression levels of both kit and kit ligand on CD34(+) cells and in plasma isolated from pre-, mid- and full-term cord blood samples; ii) the reactivation of HbF synthesis in KL-treated unilineage erythroid cell cultures; iii) the functional role of miR-221/222 in HbF production. RESULTS: In perinatal life, kit expression showed a gradual decline directly correlated to the decrease of HbF (from 80-90% to <30%). Moreover, in full-term cord blood erythroid cultures, kit ligand induced a marked increase of HbF (up to 80%) specifically abrogated by addition of the kit inhibitor imatinib, thus reversing the Hb switch. MiR-221/222 expression exhibited rising levels during peri/post-natal development. In functional studies, overexpression of these miRs in cord blood progenitors caused a remarkable decrease in kit expression, erythroblast proliferation and HbF content, whereas their suppression induced opposite effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicate that human perinatal Hb switching is under control of the kit receptor/miR 221-222 complex. We do not exclude, however, that other mechanisms (i.e. glucocorticoids and the HbF inhibitor BCL11A) may also contribute to the peri/post-natal Hb switch.
