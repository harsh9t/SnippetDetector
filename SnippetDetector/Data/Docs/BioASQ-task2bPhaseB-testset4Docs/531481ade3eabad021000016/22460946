Gene therapy might fall short in achieving a complete reversion of the β-thalassemic phenotype due to current limitations in vector design and myeloablative regimen. Following gene transfer, all or a large proportion of erythroid cells might express suboptimal levels of β-globin, impairing the therapeutic potential of the treatment. Our aim was to evaluate whether, in absence of complete reversion of the β-globin phenotype upon gene transfer, it is possible to use fetal hemoglobin induction to eliminate the residual α-globin aggregates and achieve normal levels of hemoglobin. Transgenic K562 cell lines and erythroid precursor cells from β(0)39-thalassemia patients were employed. Gene therapy was performed with the lentiviral vector T9W. Induction of fetal hemoglobin was obtained using mithramycin. Levels of mRNA and hemoglobins were determined by qRT-PCR and HPLC. First, we analyzed the effect of mithramycin on K562 transgenic cell lines harboring different copies of a lentiviral vector carrying the human β-globin gene, showing that γ-globin mRNA expression and HbF production can be induced in the presence of high levels of β-globin gene expression and HbA accumulation. We then treated erythroid progenitor cells from β-thalassemic patients with T9W, which expresses the human β-globin gene and mithramycin separately or in combination. When transduction with our lentiviral vector is insufficient to completely eliminate the unpaired α-globin chains, combination of β-globin gene transfer therapy together with fetal hemoglobin induction might be very efficacious to remove the excess of α-globin proteins in thalassemic erythroid progenitor cells.

Introduction
n ²-thalassemias, mutations of the ²-globin gene or its regulatory regions cause absence (²0 phenotype) or reduced synthesis (²+ phenotype) of ²-globin chains [1β€“4], and this impairment leads to an excess of the complementary ±-globin chains [1]. ltimately, the precipitation of ±-globin chains in excess promotes apoptosis of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and at extra-medullary sites and shortens survival of red blood cells (s) in the peripheral blood [5β€“10]. he disease is associated with morbidity and mortality due to severe chronic anemia or treatment-related complications [1].
ene therapy is one of the possible approaches for the cure of ²-thalassemia, following ²-globin gene transfer in autologous hematopoietic stem cells (s) [11β€“13]. etroviral- or lentiviral-mediated insertion of single and multiple copies of the ²-globin gene in r. PCs has been reported in many studies to demonstrate the feasibility of the gene therapy approach for the cure of Ξ²-thalassemia [11β€“17]. This approach, while straightforward in its principle, exhibits several critical issues, the major being the control of transgene expression, which needs to be: (a) erythroid-specific, (b) differentiation- and stage-restricted, (c) elevated, (d) position-independent, (f) sustained over time and (g) independent from the patient's genotype [18β€“21]. Moreover, the gene transfer, in order to be effective, needs to target the majority of HSCs, limiting the vector copy number to minimize the possibility of insertional mutagenesis. The study of Hargrove et al. [22] showed how lentiviral vector insertion can perturb the expression of endogenous genes in Ξ²-thalassemic hematopoietic cells [22]. Despite this evidence, clinical trials based on gene therapy on Ξ²-thalassemic patients have been initiated, although this therapeutic intervention was used on a restricted number of patients.
In the most recent study, a 19-year-old patient who received gene therapy treatment no longer needs palliative transfusions, and 2Β years later, seems healthy. Still, the unexpected observation of the expansion of a group of clonal cells with the same gene insertion (the HMGA2 gene) suggests that a lentiviral vector can promote growth advantage of selected cells [19]. The pattern is reminiscent of the gene therapy trial for the X-linked combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) in which a retroviral vector triggered leukemia [23]. Therefore, the potential of gene therapy is limited by the number of viral particles that can be safely incorporated into the genome. In fact, the integration of fewer molecules is necessary to avoid genotoxicity, and at the same time, a minimum number of integration is required to sustain elevated transgene expression [15].
Our laboratory has been investigating the effects of several compounds on inducing the expression of Ξ³-globin genes and the increase of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) synthesis [24β€“28]. It is generally believed that even small increases of HbF synthesis could be beneficial to Ξ²-thalassemia patients [29β€“31]. Although ErPCs from different patients might respond to a different extent to the same HbF inducer, our experience indicates that this effect is reproducible. The limitation of such approach is to reach levels of HbF clinically relevant. However, clinical trials with HbF inducers have been extensively investigated, using hydroxyurea (HU), thalidomide, and butyrates [32β€“36]. Following this research field, several studies focusing on the mechanisms regulating reactivation of HbF production in humans have been reported [27, 35, 37β€“39].
As for possible co-expression of Ξ³-globin and Ξ²-globin genes, it should be considered that during ontogeny, two switches occur in Ξ²-like globin genes expression that reflect the changing oxygen requirements of the fetus, the second of which, from Ξ³- to adult Ξ΄- and Ξ²-globin, occurs shortly after birth. Throughout the locus, cis-acting elements are dynamically bound by trans-acting proteins, including transcription factors, co-activators, repressors, and chromatin modifiers [40β€“42]. Despite the complex hierarchy of events regulating gene expression during development, from extracellular signaling to transcriptional activation or repression, the expression of Ξ²-globin and Ξ³-globin genes appears to be inversely regulated (i.e., high expression of Ξ³-globin genes versus low expression of Ξ²-globin genes and vice versa) [40, 41].
To our knowledge, no attempt has been made to verify whether induction of HbF and HbA might be obtained using cells isolated from homozygous patients unable to produce Ξ²-globin mRNA. This combined approach might have a synergistic effect, by adding HbA synthesis to high levels of HbF, which ameliorate the clinical parameters of Ξ²-thalassemia patients [28β€“31]. On the other hand, at least in theory, Ξ²-globin mRNA production following gene therapy approaches might interfere with Ξ³-globin gene expression. The aim of this paper was to verify whether the HbF inducer mithramycin (MTH) stimulates the production of HbF in erythroid cells treated with a lentiviral vector carrying a therapeutic Ξ²-globin gene. The gene transfer vector utilized in this study (T9W) [17], is a third-generation lentivirus that has been obtained by modifying TNS9, a lentiviral vector of second generation. TNS9 was successfully utilized in mice to cure and rescue thalassemic mice affected by thalassemia intermedia and major, respectively [11, 14].
We analyzed the effect of MTH on K562 cell clones carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and the red fluorescent protein (RFP) driven by the Ξ³-globin and Ξ²-globin promoter, respectively [43, 44]. We analyzed the effect of MTH on several transgenic K562 cell lines harboring different copies of the human Ξ²-globin gene to verify the possible co-expression of Ξ²-globin and Ξ³-globin mRNAs, and the possible production of HbA and HbF under stimulation with MTH. K562 cells appear to be particularly useful in this context, since wild-type K562 cells do not express the endogenous Ξ²-globin gene, being exclusively committed to the expression of embryo-fetal globin genes [47, 48]. We then treated erythroid precursor cells (ErPCs) [49, 50] from Ξ²-thalassemic individuals with both MTH and the therapeutic T9W vector and analyzed globin mRNA expression by RT-PCR and production of HbF and HbA by HPLC.

Materials and methods
entiviral vector and chemical inducers. The T9W vector was generated by modifying TNS9, with the aim of increasing its safety and efficiency. For this purpose, the 3β€² long terminal repeat (3β€² LTR) was disarmed by deleting the U3 region (self inactivating-LTR or SIN-LTR) [17]. The deletion, which includes the TATA box and all the major determinants responsible for regulating the HIV-1 promoter, abolished the LTR promoter activity, but did not affect vector titers or transgene expression in vitro (data not shown). The cis-acting woodchuck post-regulatory element (WPRE) was also introduced [17]. Mithramycin (MTH) was purchased from Sigma (St.Louis, MO, USA) [23].Vector production and titrationViral stocks were generated by co-transfection of the gene transfer plasmid T9W together with the envelope plasmid (VSV-G), the packaging plasmid (pMDLgpRRE), and the pRSV-REV plasmid into 293 T cells. An aliquot (5Β xΒ 106) of 293 T cells was seeded into cell culture dishes (10Β cm) 24Β h prior to transfection in Iscove's modification of Eagle's medium (I-MEM, CAMBREX-Biowhittaker, Europe) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biowest, NuaillΓ©, France) 100Β U/ml penicillin, and 100Β mg/ml streptomycin (Pen-Strep, CAMBREX-Biowhittaker, Europe), at 37Β°C under 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed 2Β h prior to transfection. The precipitate was formed by adding the plasmids to a volume of 450Β ΞΌl of 0.1Γ— TE (0.1Γ— TE is 10Β mM Tris plus 1Β mM EDTA) and 50Β ΞΌl of 2Β M CaCl2, then adding 500Β ΞΌl of 2Γ— HEPES-buffered saline (281Β mM NaCl, 100Β mM HEPES, 1.5Β mM Na2HPO4) drop-wise, and then the precipitate was mixed and immediately added to the cultures. The medium (10Β ml) was replaced after 16Β h. Viral supernatant was collected at 24 and 48Β h, cleared by low speed centrifugation, and filtered through cellulose acetate filters (0.2Β ΞΌm). Following concentration by ultracentrifugation, serial dilution of concentrated virus (5; 0.5; and 0.05Β ΞΌl, respectively) were used to infect 1β€‰Γ—β€‰105 NIH 3T3 cells in 1Β ml of transfection buffer complemented with polybrene (Chemicon International, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 8Β mg/ml. Genomic DNA was extracted after 3Β days (Quiagen kit, Hilden, Germany). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was calculated using the following formula: number of cells (1β€‰Γ—β€‰105)β€‰Γ—β€‰dilution factorβ€‰Γ—β€‰VCN, measured via real-time PCR, using oligos for WPRE and ID genes (see below).Generation of K562 cell clones transduced with the pCCL.PromΞ².HcRed1.PromΞ³.EGFP lentiviral vectorFor determining the activity of the Ξ³-globin and Ξ²-globin promoters under different treatment conditions, we modified the pCCL.PGK.GFP.WPRE construct, in which a constitutive expression of the eGFP gene is driven by the human phosphoglycerokinase gene promoter [43]. The PGK sequence was replaced by the Ξ³-globin promoter to drive the expression of the eGFP gene. Additionally, we cloned into this construct the red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene together with the regulatory LCR and Ξ²-globin promoter elements. Human K562 cells [47] were used to obtain stable transfectants. In this system, increase of green eGFP signal will be consistent with a Ξ³-globin gene promoter driven activity; on the contrary, increase of the far-red FP signal will be associated with Ξ²-globin promoter activity [43, 44]. For determining the promoter activity, cells were seeded at 12500 cells/ml and treated with MTH. After 5Β days of culture, cells were assayed for fluorescent protein expression. For the determination of fluorescence intensity using the FACScanβ„Ά Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), cells were harvested and washed; then, 10,000 cells were analyzed using the fl1 and the fl3 channels to detect green and red fluorescence, respectively, and analyses were carried out by using the Cell Quest (Becton Dickinson) software.Human K562 cell clones carrying the human Ξ²-globin geneFor the generation of stable K562 clones integrating human Ξ²-globin gene, the pCCL.Ξ²-globin.PGW vector was used [43, 44]. Transduction was carried out by plating 106Β K562 cells in 9.5-cm2 dishes with 45% RPMI and 45% I-MDM (Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium, CAMBREXβ€”Biowhittaker Europe), 10% FBS, 2Β mM l-glutamine (CAMBREXβ€”Biowhittaker Europe, Milan, Italy), 100Β U/ml penicillin, and 100Β mg/ml streptomycin in humified atmosphere of 5% CO2/air and adding the decided volume of the viral supernatant. In order to facilitate cell infection, 10Β ΞΌl of the 800Β ΞΌg/ΞΌl transduction agent polybrene (Chemicon International, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was added to the K562 cells plated, which were subsequently cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 7Β days, cells were cloned by limiting dilutions and GFP-producing clones identified under a fluorescence microscope and further characterized. Cell cultures were maintained in humified atmosphere of 5% CO2/air in RPMI 1640 medium (SIGMA, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50Β U/ml penicillin, and 50Β mg/ml streptomycin. Cell growth was studied by with a ZF Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL, USA).In vitro culture of erythroid progenitors from Ξ²-thalassemia patientsBlood samples of patients were collected following receiving informed consent. The two-phase liquid culture procedure was employed as previously described [49, 50]. Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood samples by Ficollβ€“Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and seeded in Ξ±-minimal essential medium (Ξ±-MEM, SIGMA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Celbio, Milano, Italy), 1Β ΞΌg/ml cyclosporine A (Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland), and 10% conditioned medium from the 5637 bladder carcinoma cell line. The cultures were incubated at 37Β°C, under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, with extra humidity. After 7Β days incubation in this phase I culture, the non-adherent cells were harvested, washed, and then cultured in fresh medium composed of Ξ±-MEM (SIGMA), 30% FBS (Celbio), 1% deionized bovine serum albumin (BSA, SIGMA), 10-5Β M Ξ²-mercaptoethanol (SIGMA), 2Β mM l-glutamine (SIGMA), 10β�’6Β M dexamethasone (SIGMA), and 1Β U/ml human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) (Tebu-bio, Magenta, Milano, Italy) and stem cell factor (SCF, BioSource International, Camarillo, CA, USA). This part of the culture is referred to as phase II [47]. Erythroid differentiation was determined by counting benzidine positive cells after suspending the cells in a solution containing 0.2% benzidine in 0.5Β M glacial acetic acid, 10% H2O2 [49]. Treatment with MTH was carried out by adding the appropriate drug concentrations at the beginning of the experiment (cells were usually seeded at 106 cells/ml). For analysis of hemoglobins, cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the pellets were processed in lysis buffer (0.01% sodium dodecyl sulphate). After spinning for 1Β min in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was collected and stored at 4Β°C.Transduction of erythroid precursors (ErPC) from Ξ²Β°-thalassemia patients with a lentiviral vector carrying the human Ξ²-globin geneMock control cells were compared to samples treated with MTH or T9W, separately. Moreover, an aliquot of the cells transduced with T9W were also treated with MTH. ErPCs were infected with serial dilutions of the virus, starting from multiplicity of infection (MOI) equal to 0.3 and multiples of it. ErPCs were routinely infected at the beginning of phase 2, when erythropoietin was administered to the cells to promote their erythroid commitment.RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR analysisK562 clones and erythroid precursor cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 5Β min at 4Β°C, washed in PBS, lysed in 1Β ml of TRIZOLΒ® Reagent (GIBCO-Invitrogen-Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated RNA was washed once with cold 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate treated water before use. For gene expression analysis, 1Β ΞΌg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by using random hexamers. Quantitative real-time PCR assay was carried out using gene-specific double fluorescently labeled probes in a 7700 Sequence Detection System version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems, Warrington Cheshire, UK) as described elsewhere [23, 24, 46]. The nucleotide sequences used for real-time PCR analysis are reported in TableΒ 1. For real-time PCR analysis, we used as reference gene the endogenous control human GAPDH kit (Applied Biosystems). The fluorescent reporter and the quencher of the GAPDH probe were VIC and 6-carboxy-N,N,Nβ€²,Nβ€²-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), respectively.Table 1Primers and probes for RT-qPCRΞ±-GlobinForward primer5β€²-CACGCGCACAAGCTTCG-3β€²Reverse primer5β€²-AGGGTCACCAGCAGGCAGT-3β€²Probe5β€²-FAM-TGGACCCGGTCAACTTCAAGCTCCT-TAMRA-3β€²Ξ²-GlobinForward primer5β€²-CAAGAAAGTGCTCGGTGCCT-3β€²Reverse primer5β€²-GCAAAGGTGCCCTTGAGGT-3β€²Probe5β€²-FAM-TAGTGATGGCCTGGCTCACCTGGA-TAMRA-3β€²Ξ³-GlobinForward primer5β€²-TGGCAAGAAGGTGCTGACTTC-3β€²Reverse primer5β€²-TCACTCAGCTGGGCAAAGC-3β€²Probe5β€²-FAM-TGGGAGATGCCATAAAGCACCTGC-TAMRA-3β€²High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)Human erythroid precursor cells were harvested, washed once with PBS, and the pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (0.01% sodium dodecyl sulphate).

Hb proteins present in the lysates were separated by cation-exchange HPLC [24], using a Beckman Coulter instrument System Gold 126 Solvent Module-166 Detector. Hemoglobins were separated using a Syncropak CCM 103/25 (250β€‰Γ—β€‰4.6Β mm) column, samples were eluted in a solvent gradient utilizing aqueous sodium acetateβ€“BisTrisβ€“KCN buffers and detection was performed at 415Β nm. The standard controls were the purified HbA (SIGMA, St Louis, MO, USA) and HbF (Alpha Wassermann, Milano, Italy) [23].Statistical analysisThe statistical significance of difference between treatments was analyzed, when appropriate, using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Studentβ€“Newman Keul's test. p values lower than 0.01 were considered statistically significant.

Results
o-existence of ³-globin and ²-globin promoter activities in 562 cells. The first set of experiments was designed to determine whether co-existence of transcriptional activity driven by the human Ξ³-globin and Ξ²-globin promoters might take place in human erythroid cells treated with MTH. To this aim, we used K562 cellular clones described in Guerrini et al. [43] and Lampronti et al. [44] and transduced the cells with the recombinant pCCL.PromΞ².HcRed1.PromΞ³.EGFP vector (see Fig.Β 1a), carrying a green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and a red fluorescent protein (RFP) genes under the control of Ξ³-globin and Ξ²-globin promoters, respectively [43, 44]. Using this experimental cellular system, the increase of green (eGFP) signal is consistent with a Ξ³-globin promoter-driven transcriptional activity, while the increase of the far red (RFP) signal is associated with Ξ²-globin promoter activity [43].Fig. 1a Map of the pCCL.PromΞ².HcRed1.PromΞ³.EGFP vector, carrying the green fluorescence protein gene (EGFP) under the control of the Ξ³-globin gene promoter and the red fluorescence protein gene (RFP) under the control of the Ξ²-globin gene promoter. bβ€“e Representative effects of mithramycin on the expression of EGFP (b, c, d) and RFP (b, c, e). A stable clone of K562 cells harboring the pCCL.promΞ².HcRed1.promΞ³.EGFP vector was used and cultured in the absence (panel b and solid lines of panels d and e) or in the presence of 50Β nM MTH (panel c and dotted lines of panels d and e). Analysis was performed after 5Β days of MTH treatmentIn the experiment shown in Fig.Β 1bβ€“e, K562 cells (12,500 cells/ml) were treated with 50Β nM MTH and, after 5Β days of culture, were assayed for fluorescent proteins expression. FigureΒ 1c,d shows that MTH induces high levels of Ξ³-globin promoter-driven transcription. This is expected due to the effect mediated by MTH on HbF induction and Ξ³-globin gene transcription [23]. However, Ξ²-globin promoter driven transcription can also be activated by this concentration of MTH, as reported in panels c and e of Fig.Β 1. Treatment of K562 clones with 50Β nM MTH induced a more modest but still net increase of RFP-associated fluorescence, compared to the eGFP-associate fluorescence. These data strongly suggest that both Ξ³-globin and Ξ²-globin gene promoter activity can take place in MTH-induced K562 cells.Mithramycin treatment of K562 cell clones carrying multiple copies of the human Ξ²-globin geneNative K562 cells produce low amounts of hemoglobin and exhibit low proportion of benzidine-positive (hemoglobin-producing) cells at baseline [47, 48]. Following treatment with selected chemicals, K562 cells undergo erythroid differentiation exhibiting high levels of embryo-fetal hemoglobin (mainly Hb Gower-1 and Hb Portland). However, even in the erythroid-induced state, K562 cells do not exhibit Ξ²-globin mRNA expression [47]. We have previously shown that a lentiviral vector carrying this Ξ²-globin construct is able to express the Ξ²-globin mRNA and the corresponding protein in K562 cells after differentiation [45, 46]. This observation suggests that this combination of the genomic elements (gene, promoter, and LCR elements) from the Ξ²-globin locus is not recognized by the protein complex that suppresses Ξ²-globin transcription, at least in K562 cells. Therefore, K562 cells represent a suitable system to study activation of the transgenic Ξ²-globin gene harbored by pCCL.Ξ²-globin.PGW (see Fig.Β 2a). This construct was chosen for the expression of a GFP sequence, which greatly facilitates the identification of transduced cells, and the determination of the integrated copies of the gene. We have described elsewhere the infection of K562 cells with different MOI units of pCCL.Ξ²-globin.PGW vector and the isolation of ten clones that show, by real-time quantitative PCR analysis, different levels of genomic integration of the human Ξ²-globin gene [44]. We chose the K-wt3 clone which harbors one copy of the pCCL.Ξ²-globin.PGW vector/genome. FigureΒ 2b, c shows the levels of Ξ²- and Ξ³-globin mRNA expressions after MTH treatment of original K562 cells and of K-wt3 cells. High expression of Ξ²-globin mRNA was observed in MTH-induced clone K-wt3; on the contrary, very low expression of Ξ²-globin mRNA was detected, as expected, in original K562 cells, at baseline and after induction to erythroid differentiation by MTH. Both K562 and, to a lower extent, K-wt3 cells, accumulated Ξ³-globin mRNA, which is further induced following treatment with MTH (Fig.Β 2c). Despite the fact that our experiments do not clarify the lower content of Ξ³-globin mRNA in K-wt3 cells in respect to original K562 cells, the data obtained demonstrate that endogenous transcription of Ξ³-globin mRNA can be carried out in the presence of de novo transcription of Ξ²-globin mRNA. In complete agreement, Fig.Β 2d, e shows that MTH-induced K562 cells produced HbF but not HbA (Fig.Β 2d), while MTH-induced clone K-wt3 synthetized both HbF and HbA (Fig.Β 2e), based on the HPLC analyses. High levels of embryo-fetal Hbs were observed in both original K562 cells and clone K-wt3 (data not shown). This indicates that, while original K562 cells are committed to preferential expression of embryo-fetal globins and hemoglobins, clone K-wt3, which carries a novel integrated unit of a functional human Ξ²-globin gene under the transcriptional control of this engineered LCR, is able to produce HbA in the presence of HbF induction.Fig. 2a Map of the pCCL.Ξ²-globin.PGW vector, carrying the human Ξ²-globin gene under the control of a mini-LCR as published elsewhere [45]. b, c Expression of Ξ²-globin (b) and Ξ³-globin (c) genes following treatment of original K562 cells (white boxes) and K562-wt3 clone (black boxes) with 50Β nM MTH. As evident only in the K562-wt3 clone, the Ξ²-globin gene is highly expressed. d, e Production of HbF and HbA following treatment of original K562 cells (d) and K562-wt3 clone (e) with 50Β nM MTH. As evident, only in the K562-wt3 clone HbA is produced. Accumulation of globin mRNAs was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (for sequences of PCR primers see TableΒ 1). Production of HbA and HbF was studied by HPLC. HbA and HbF were barely detectable in uninduced cells (data not shown)Treatment of erythroid precursor cells (ErPCs) from Ξ²-thalassemia patients with the T9W vector: effects on Ξ²-globin mRNA and HbA productionIn order to have preliminary information on the efficacy to increase Ξ²-globin mRNA following treatment of Ξ²-thalassemic erythroid precursor cells with the therapeutic T9W vector (Fig.Β 3a) [17], ErPCs from seven homozygous Ξ²039-thalassemic patients were infected with T9W. At the end of the standard culture procedure, Ξ²-globin mRNA content was assayed by quantitative RT-PCR and HbA production by HPLC (Fig.Β 3bβ€“e).Fig. 3a The lentiviral vector utilized in this study (T9W), presenting the insertion of the CMV promoter in the 5β€² LTR, a partial deletion of the 3β€² LTR, and the inclusion of the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to increase safety and production, respectively. Black arrowed rectangles represent exons of the Ξ²-globin gene [17]. b, c Ability of the employed lentiviral system (T9W) to induce accumulation of HbA following infection of erythroid precursor cells with T9W.

Data of panels d and e represent averageβ€‰Β±β€‰SD from seven independent experimentsThe results indicate that the ErPCs from these patients were responsive to gene transfer, as shown by the significant increase of Ξ²-globin mRNA content (Fig.Β 3d) without any changes in accumulation of Ξ±- and Ξ³-globin mRNAs. FigureΒ 3b, c shows a representative HPLC analysis of ErPCs lysates derived from a homozygous Ξ²039-thalassemic patient at baseline (panel b) or after gene transfer with T9W (panel c). Noticeably, the HbA peak was detectable only in lysates of ErPCs that were infected with T9W (Fig.Β 3c). No major changes were observed on the production of HbF and HbA2. The relative high level of HbA2 is explained by the low overall protein levels of HbA and HbF proteins [17], whilst HbA2 is very low when HbF is expressed at very high levels, as indicated by HPLC analysis of transfusion-independent HPFH patients [51]. Interestingly, a decrease (but not complete suppression) of the peak corresponding to free Ξ±-globin (asterisk) was evident. These results confirm that T9W is able to convert Ξ²039-thalassemic ErPCs (unable to produce HbA) to HbA-producing cells.As expected, a direct correlation between MOI and HbA production was observed; moreover, decrease of the Ξ±-globin peak was achieved only when high MOI was employed. Unfortunately, at these MOI, multiple genomic integration of the T9W was obtained, an experimental condition that might produce unwanted expression of genes adjacent to integration sites.Treatment of T9W infected erythroid precursor cells from Ξ²039-thalassemia patients with MTH: effects on production of globin mRNAsIn order to analyze the effects of MTH on transduced ErPCs, cells were infected with the T9W lentiviral vector alone or in combination with MTH, using MTH concentrations known to stimulate increased expression of the Ξ³-globin genes without major changes in the Ξ²-globin mRNA production, as published by Fibach et al. [24] and reviewed in Gambari and Fibach [28]. We decided to perform this protocol using ErPC from Ξ²039/Ξ²039 thalassemic patients exhibiting different starting levels of HbF (ranging from about 10% up to 50%). Preliminary real-time RT-qPCR experiments performed on a large cohort of ErPCs normal donors and Ξ²039/Ξ²039 thalassemic patients allows us to conclude that (a) in thalassemic ErPCs the relative expression of Ξ±-globin genes is higher than that found in ErPCs from normal donors; (b) Ξ²-globin mRNA production is about 80% in respect to Ξ±-globin mRNA in ErPCs from normal donors, being not more than 2.5% in thalassemic ErPCs as expected, due to the nonsense mediated decay of the Ξ²039-globin mRNA. The results of the quantitative RT-PCR data are shown in TableΒ 2. As expected, based on the results that we previously reported [24], MTH has no effects on Ξ²-globin and Ξ±-globin gene expression (TableΒ 2). However, MTH was able to stimulate Ξ³-globin mRNA accumulation in erythroid progenitors, irrespectively from T9W transduction. In fact, in T9W transduced cells, increase of Ξ³-globin mRNA production was induced by MTH together with de novo production of Ξ²-globin mRNA, which is exclusively associated with T9W transduction (TableΒ 2). In addition, MTH had only minor effects on the amount of Ξ²-globin mRNA produced after infection with the T9W lentiviral vector. Furthermore, transduction with T9W had no effect on Ξ±-globin and Ξ³-globin mRNA accumulation (TableΒ 2).Table 2Accumulation of globin mRNA following treatment with MTH of T9W infected ErPCs from thalassemic patientsGenotypeTreatmentGlobin mRNA increaseΞ±-Globin mRNAΞ³-Globin mRNAΞ²-Globin mRNAΞ²039/Ξ²039MTH1.02β€‰Β±β€‰0.312.36β€‰Β±β€‰0.550.95β€‰Β±β€‰0.22T9W1.15β€‰Β±β€‰0.411.08β€‰Β±β€‰0.352.32β€‰Β±β€‰0.41T9Wβ€‰+β€‰MTH1.03β€‰Β±β€‰0.211.85β€‰Β±β€‰0.282.12β€‰Β±β€‰0.44Data represent the fold changes (averageβ€‰Β±β€‰S.D.) of the indicated mRNAs in respect to control untreated ErPCs.

ErPCs of Ξ²039/Ξ²039 patients treated with both T9W and MTH exhibited increase of HbF and de novo synthesis of HbA (bottom part of the panels a and b of Fig.Β 4). No major effects (i.e., suppression or induction) on HbA were observed when erythroid progenitors were transduced with T9W alone or in combination with MTH (TableΒ 3). HbF synthesis was always augmented in cells treated with MTH (with or without T9W), although in cells transduced with T9W, the MTH-induced increased HbF levels have to be considered in relationship with the simultaneous increased synthesis of HbA (TableΒ 3). These data support the notion that induction of HbF by MTH and production of HbA with T9W might take place in the same ErPC cell cultures of Ξ²Β°-39-thalassemic patients; this conclusion is also reinforced by the analysis of the ratios HbF/HbA2 and HbA/HbA2 (Fig.Β 4c, d). When data from panels c and d of Fig.Β 4 were considered together with the results of TableΒ 3, it appears evident that T9W transduced ErPCs from Ξ²039/Ξ²039 patients are induced to produce both HbA and HbF, when treated with MTH.Fig. 4a, b Representative HPLC results on ErPCs from two Ξ²039-homozygous patients infected with T9W in the presence of MTH (bottom panels); the top panels report HPLC profiles of untreated, uninfected ErPCs.

MTH was used at 50Β nMErPCs transduced with T9W and treated with MTH: amelioration of the phenotypeIn all the HPLC analysis of ErPC cultures from thalassemic patients, in addition to HbF, HbA, and HbA2, a peak corresponding to Ξ±-globin chain aggregates (indicated by the asterisks in FigsΒ 3 and 4) was observed. In consideration of the relationship between excess of Ξ±-globin chain content and pathophysiology of thalassemia, a reduction of this peak might be considered an important indication of the amelioration of the phenotype [15, 17]. In this respect, we like to point out that the combined treatment with T9W and MTH reduces dramatically the presence of the HPLC peak corresponding to Ξ±-globin chain aggregates as reported in TableΒ 3 and in the summary data included in panel a of Fig.Β 5. Therefore, while the T9W transduction or the MTH treatment reduced the peak corresponding to the Ξ±-globin chain, the combined approach led to an additive and very efficient inhibitory effect on the production of Ξ±-globin aggregates. This was observed without exception in all the experiments performed (TableΒ 3). This important effect was achieved using amount of T9W leading to β�Ό1 copy of the vector per genome (Fig.Β 5b) and MTH concentrations that did not have any effect on Ξ²-globin mRNA accumulation (TableΒ 2) and HbA synthesis (TableΒ 3).Fig. 5a Effects of treatment with T9W, MTH, and T9Wβ€‰+β€‰MTH on the Ξ±-globin peak content [17], shown in Figs.Β 3 and 4 with asterisks. *pβ€‰<β€‰0.05; **pβ€‰<β€‰0.01.

Discussion
he aim of the present investigation was to verify whether a co-treatment of r. PCs from Ξ²-thalassemia patients with lentiviral-mediated gene transfer and with inducers of fetal hemoglobin could be effective to stimulate HbF and HbA production and abolish the excess of Ξ±-globin accumulation in erythroid cells. To address this question, we employed the T9W lentiviral vector for the infection and mithramycin as HbF inducer. We previously reported the efficacy of these tools for gene therapy purposes [17] or HbF induction [23]. In this study, all thalassemic specimens were obtained from homozygous Ξ²039-thalassemia patients.
The first set of results demonstrated that the T9W lentiviral vector was able to induce Ξ²-globin gene expression and protein synthesis in ErPCs from homozygous Ξ²039-thalassemia patients, confirming observations previously reported [17]. As depicted in Fig.Β 3, this result was consistently reproduced. However, after infection, all samples continue to synthesize some, although reduced, free Ξ±-globin chains, indicating that the excess of Ξ±-globin content was not completely abolished.
The major finding of this manuscript is the formal demonstration that forced expression of Ξ²-globin and Ξ³-globin genes, respectively, by gene transfer and HbF induction, profoundly improves hemoglobin synthesis among Ξ²-thalassemic ErPC cells. This is achieved by reducing or eliminating free Ξ±-globin chain aggregates, indicating that this approach can correct clinically relevant parameters in treated cells. In this respect, the restoration of a balance between Ξ±-globin and Ξ²-like globin chains (here Ξ³-globins and Ξ²-globins) is associated with clear amelioration of the phenotype of thalassemic cells [52β€“54]. In this paper, we focused on the effects of co-treatment with MTH and the T9W lentiviral vector on cells derived from homozygous Ξ²039-thalassemia patients, and similar findings were observed in preliminary experiments performed using ErPCs from two Ξ²+39-thalassemia patients carrying a Ξ²039/Ξ²+IVSI-110 genotype (Zuccato et al., unpublished observations).
We believe that these data emphasize the clinical relevance of combining gene therapy with HbF induction for the cure of Ξ²-thalassemia. An elevated expression of fetal hemoglobin is beneficial to patients affected by thalassemia intermedia [28β€“34]. Several experiments conducted in animal models [55] as well as in patients treated with HbF inducers, support the use of HbF induction [28β€“31, 33]. Recently, Ehsani et al. [33] showed that a 6-month treatment of 16 transfusion-independent thalassemia intermedia patients with a 20Β mg/kg/day dose of HU 4Β days per week produced a significant increase of HbF resulting in the amelioration of hematological parameters. While a larger sample size study is needed to validate our data, these results appear to be well in agreement with independent reports showing a dramatic response of several Ξ²-thalassemia patients to HU-mediated induction of HbF [28, 32β€“34]. Relevant to the issues covered in this paper, Musallam et al. [56] analyzed the association between HbF levels and morbidity in Ξ²-thalassemia intermedia on a cohort of 63 untransfused patients who had also never received HbF induction therapy. There was a strong negative correlation between the HbF level and the total number of morbidities [56].
Our results suggest that the combination of gene therapy with HbF induction (GT/HbF strategy) might be very useful to eliminate the excess of Ξ±-globins detected by the HPLC analyses of ErPCs from Ξ²-thalassemia patients. This appears to be a major goal in therapeutic intervention on Ξ²-thalassemic erythroid cells and, if reached, is expected to ameliorate the physiological parameter of treated cells.
In conclusion, our data suggest that the GT/HbF strategy, employing the co-treatment of target erythroid precursor cells with a lentiviral vector carrying a therapeutic Ξ²-globin gene and the HbF inducer mithramycin, leads to forced de novo accumulation of HbA and increased production of HbF, ultimately suppressing the excess of free Ξ±-globin chains. These results might be relevant for establishing a protocol maximizing the production of clinically therapeutic hemoglobins in thalassemic ErPCs.
In addition, our findings strongly support the need of further studies employing co-treatment with gene-therapy lentiviral vectors and other fetal hemoglobin inducers (including DNA-based HbF inducers). These studies are crucial since mithramycin is a chemotherapeutic agent which might cause toxicity if used in life-long treatments. However, less toxic mithramycin analogs have been recently described which exhibit better pharmacokinetics and tolerance [57]. Finally, the results here presented support the use of vectors carrying the Ξ²-globin gene together with sequences enabling the production of HbF. Recently, Wilber et al. [58] showed that a lentiviral vector encoding a short-hairpin RNA targeting the Ξ³-globin gene repressor BCL11A was able to increase HbF levels from 33% to 45% in Ξ²-thalassemic erythroid cells, without compromising erythroid differentiation. On the basis of these findings and on the results here presented, novel vectors carrying, in addition to the therapeutic Ξ²-globin gene, sequences driving the production of shRNAs targeting mRNA encoding a repressor of human Ξ³-globin gene transcription would be of interest, since they are expected to force Ξ²-globin gene transcription together with reactivation of Ξ³-globin genes and HbF production.
