Self-splicing of group I intron from the 26S rRNA of Candida albicans is essential for maturation of the host RNA. Here, we demonstrated that the co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron. The core-targeted AON effectively and specifically inhibited the intron splicing from its host RNA in living C. albicans. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments showed that the growth inhibition was caused by a fungicidal effect. For the first time, we showed that an AON targeting the ribozyme core folding specifically inhibits the endogenous ribozyme splicing in living cells and specifically kills the intron-containing fungal strains, which sheds light on the development of antifungal drugs in the future.
