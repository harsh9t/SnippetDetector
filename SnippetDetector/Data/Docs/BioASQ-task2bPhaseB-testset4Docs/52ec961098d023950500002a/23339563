CONTEXT: Kidney-related pathologies have increasing prevalence rates, produce a considerable financial burden, and are characterized by elevated levels of oxidative stress (OS). OBJECTIVE: This review examines relationships between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and markers of OS and antioxidant status (AS). METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE-indexed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials and comparative studies that examined OS and AS was performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Several markers emerged as well-suited indicators of OS and AS in CKD: malondialdehyde, F2-isoprostanes, lipid hydroperoxides, asymmetric dimethylarginine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, protein carbonyls, advanced oxidation protein products and glutathione-related activity.
