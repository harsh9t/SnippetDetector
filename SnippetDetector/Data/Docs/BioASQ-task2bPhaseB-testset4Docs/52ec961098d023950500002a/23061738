BACKGROUND: We investigated whether urinary mRNA of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) and nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (CCN3) can provide clinical insight into the management of patients with nondiabetic CKD. METHODS: Urinary mRNA expression of CCN2 and CCN3 were measured by Real-time PCR in 35 CKD patients and 12 controls. RESULTS: Urinary mRNA of CCN2 and CCN3 were distinctively greater in CKDs than healthy controls. Urinary CCN3/CCN2 mRNA ratio correlated to the degree of glomerular histological changes in those who received renal biopsy. CONCLUSION: Urinary CCN3/CCN2 mRNA ratio may be a useful noninvasive biomarker for evaluating patients with nondiabetic CKD prior to renal biopsy.
