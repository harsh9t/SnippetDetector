<abstract>
If patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa are treated with diet and additionally over a period of two weeks with 2 grams of Clofibrate daily, the cholesterol-level in the serum decreases. This decrease is caused mainly by a reduction of the apolipoprotein B and the LDL-cholesterol in serum. If elevated cholesterol-levels in the serum are reduced through a "prudent" diet, the concentration of apolipoprotein B in serum remains the same. It is not fully understood which influence a diet, which is rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids and has a low content of saturated fatty acids and carbohydrates, has upon the lipoproteins in the serum. The mode of action of this diet and its significance for the concentration of HDL need further investigation.
