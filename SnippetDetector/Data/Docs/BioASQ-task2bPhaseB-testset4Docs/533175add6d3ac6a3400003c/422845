Nutritional factors in the aetiology of coronary heart disease, maturity-onset diabetes, diverticular disease and dental caries are discussed. Four principles for a prudent diet are suggested, namely: avoid excess intake of energy, increase dietary fibre intake, reduce total fat intake to approximately 30 per cent of energy intake, take a high proportion of fat as the polyunsaturated form.
