In a randomized, single-blind and controlled trial, the effects of the administration of fruits and vegetables (mean 582 vs. 188 g/day) for 12 weeks were compared as adjuncts to a prudent diet in the management of 202 group A and 204 group B patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Fruits and vegetables decreased total serum cholesterol level (26.4 vs. 13.8 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (20.0 vs. 9.8 mg/dl, p less than 0.01), triglycerides (20.6 vs. 10.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) and fasting blood glucose (22.4 vs. 12.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) levels more significant in the intervention group than changes in the control group. Adherence to dietary advice was assessed by questionnaires. Total adherence score in group A was significantly higher than in group B. Group A patients also had a significantly smaller rise in lactate dehydrogenase cardiac enzyme which indicates that the protective effects of such a diet may be observed within 1 week. There was a significantly greater decrease in mean blood pressure in group A than changes in group B. These data suggest that fruits and vegetables, because of their high soluble dietary fibre and possibly high antioxidant contents, may be a useful and safe adjunct to a prudent diet in the treatment of patients with AMI. The use of fruits and vegetables may be preferred over oat bran, psyllium and guar gum because of their high content of vitamins and minerals.
