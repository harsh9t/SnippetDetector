Risk factor status for cardiovascular disease is affected by life style. Adolescence is a time during which long term life-style habits, including dietary habits, are established. Physicians who treat adolescent patients have a responsibility to be aware of the scientific evidence on the diet-heart question so that they can provide their patients with sound dietary advice. The American Heart Association has recommended that Americans consume a "prudent diet" in which daily consumption of cholesterol is no more than 300 mg with up to 30-35% of calories derived from fat, and less than 10% of calories derived from saturated fat and less than 10% from polyunsaturated fat. This paper reviews this recommendation with particular reference to studies of adolescents. This review centers around four main issues: 1) the estimated effect on serum cholesterol levels of a switch from the usual American diet to the prudent diet; 2) the effect of a predicted decrease in serum cholesterol on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease; 3) evaluation of the evidence of possible adverse effects of the prudent diet; 4) feasibility of the prudent diet. Based on a review of these four issues, the authors feel that the American Heart Association's prudent diet should be strongly recommended for all healthy adolescents.
