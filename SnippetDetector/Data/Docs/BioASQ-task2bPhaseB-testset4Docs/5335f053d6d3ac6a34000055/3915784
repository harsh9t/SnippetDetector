A temperature shift from 40 to 28 degrees C rapidly induced expression of a specific immobilization antigen at the cell surface in Tetrahymena thermophila. This transformation was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide but not by colchicine or cytochalasin B. The major surface antigen expressed at 28 degrees C in cells homozygous for the SerH3 allele was partially purified, and an antiserum against this preparation was raised in rabbits. Electrophoresis, immunoblot, and [35S]methionine incorporation studies are reported which support the conclusion that the H3 antigen is an acidic protein with an Mr of approximately 52,000 daltons. An induced synthesis of the H3 immobilization antigen was detected within 30 min after a shift from 40 to 28 degrees C. This protein appeared to be synthesized in the microsomal fraction and transferred without cleavage to the cell surface, where it was inserted first into nonciliated regions.
