Multiple alleles at the SerH locus specify the major cell surface protein (immobilization antigen) of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. Following mutagenesis of SerH1 homozygotes, two mutations, H1-1 and H1-2, were recovered in heterozygous form. Mutant homozygotes do not express H1 antigen, nor is H1 expressed in F1 progeny of crosses to wild-type strains homozygous for SerH2 or SerH3. H1-1 and H1-2 segregate without recombination from these wild-type alleles in expected F2 and testcross Mendelian ratios. H1-1 and H1-2 do, however, complement each other to express H1 antigen. Experiments suggest this complementation is due neither to recombination during macronuclear development nor to interallelic complementation of defective SerH1 gene products. These results suggest that SerH1 is intact in one mutant, and possibly both, although no such allele has been segregated in testcross progeny (N = 205). The hypothesis is presented that complementation between H1-1 and H1-2 is due to interaction between allele-specific regulators closely linked to the SerH1 gene.
