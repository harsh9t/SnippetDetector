<abstract>
The release of arachidonic acid, a precursor in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, is achieved by activity of the cytosolic phospholipase A(2)α (cPLA(2)α). Signaling mediated by this class of bioactive lipids, which are collectively referred to as eicosanoids, has numerous effects in physiological and pathological processes. Herein, we report the development of a ligand-based pharmacophore model and pharmacophore-based virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database, leading to the identification of 4-(hexadecyloxy)-3-(2-(hydroxyimino)-3-oxobutanamido)benzoic acid (NSC 119957) as cPLA(2)α inhibitor in cell-free and cell-based in vitro assays.

During the last decade, efforts have been made to identify novel selective inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase 2± (c. PLA2Ξ±), which is a member of the PLA2 family.1 In general, the members of this superfamily have a crucial role in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). These lipolytic enzymes cleave arachidonic acid (AA) from the esters of membrane phospholipids in sn-2 position. The further production of PGs and LTs, collectively referred to as eicosanoids, is catalyzed by several downstream-functioning enzymes such as cyclooxygenases or 5-lipoxygenase.2β€“4

Several non-selective and selective inhibitors of c. PLA2Ξ± have been reported (Fig. 1). The published in vivo data of these inhibitors in models of inflammation confirms their efficacy.5β€“11 Therefore, and based on data obtained from cPLA2Ξ± deficient mice, cPLA2Ξ± is considered an interesting target for the treatment of several inflammatory and allergic diseases.12,13 Recently, the role of cPLA2Ξ± in prostate cancer was characterized.14

The active site of c. PLA2Ξ± is arranged around a catalytic dyad, composed of Ser228 and Asp549. The translocation of cPLA2Ξ± to the perinuclear membrane is induced by an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The interaction of the enzyme with the lipid interface is assumed to induce a substantial change of the enzyme conformation including the movement of a loop that covers the active site, referred to as lid region. This profound change allows the lipid substrate to bind to the active site. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the enzyme at Ser505 by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) alters the active site conformation.15 In summary, large changes of the enzyme conformation result from interaction with the lipid interface and from phosphorylation by MAPKs. Therefore, the X-ray crystal structure of cPLA2Ξ± (PDB ID: 1cjy), representing an inactive state of the hydrolase, was not used for structure-based modeling. Instead, virtual screening was conducted by using a ligand-based 3D pharmacophore model. In general, 3D pharmacophore modeling and pharmacophore-based screening have been established in drug discovery for several applications that include lead identification, lead optimization, and de novo design.16,17 To our best knowledge, pharmacophore modeling of cPLA2Ξ± inhibitors has not been reported before. Herein, we report the development of a ligand-based pharmacophore model for cPLA2Ξ± inhibitors as well as pharmacophore-based virtual screening, in order to identify novel chemical classes of cPLA2Ξ± ligands.

In order to develop ligand-based pharmacophore models, the 3 models were generated using the ip. Hop refine module in Catalyst 4.11 from Accelrys (http://www.accelrys.com).18 The discriminatory power of the retrieved pharmacophore models was investigated by screening two datasets. The first one was a test set of highly active inhibitors that were not included in the training set. As putatively inactive molecules, so-called decoys, a compound collection assembled from the ChEMBL 03, from which reported inhibitors of all PLA2 subtypes had previously been removed, was screened. The enrichment obtained in the screening experiments was quantitatively investigated by two enrichment metrics. The model with the highest enrichment of active compounds was selected for a virtual screening campaign of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database. Afterward, compounds were submitted for evaluation in biological testings after visual inspection of the hit list (Fig. 2).

Out of a heterogeneous dataset of c. PLA2Ξ± inhibitors, examples shown in Figure 1, this molecular modeling study focused on three chemical classes that are composed of an aryl-alkyl-/alkyl-(oxy) side chain, a central carbonyl moiety, and in most cases of two to three aromatic rings.

First, conformational models of the training set compounds (ig. 3) were generated with a maximum number of 255 conformations per molecule and β€�β€™ quality within atalyst. or the common feature pharmacophore hypotheses generation, the ip. Hop algorithm was used.19,20 Using HipHop refine, these models were fine-tuned by strategically placing XVOLs in approximated forbidden areas from steric hindrance.21 For this reason, the activity order of the training set compounds is a mandatory input for hypothesis generation. Highly active and medium active training set compounds are labeled with 2 and 1, respectively, and weakly or inactive compounds with 0.22

In brief, the hypothesis generation was performed by using six highly active (class 2) inhibitors from the diaryloxy-propan-2-one and the 5-carboxyindole-1-yl-propan-2-one scaffolds (6β€“11),23,24 and four moderately active inhibitors (class 1), namely the 2-oxoamide inhibitor 1,5 and three diaryloxy-propan-2-one inhibitors (12β€“14)25,26 (ig. 3). he algorithm uses the information of medium active compounds to conduct a ranking of initially generated hypotheses. he hypotheses that map the highly active inhibitors and the moderately active inhibitors in consistency with their experimental data are prioritized. dditionally, four weakly active or inactive compounds (15β€“18), selected basically from the same chemical classes,25,26 were used for the steric refinement step (ig. 3).  summary of the training set compounds with the assigned activity classes is given in able 1. he generation of 3 pharmacophore models resulted in ten hypotheses, of which seven models consisted of six features, two were composed of five features, and one of seven features, respectively.In brief, the hypothesis generation was performed by using six highly active (class 2) inhibitors from the diaryloxy-propan-2-one and the 5-carboxyindole-1-yl-propan-2-one scaffolds (6β€“11),23,24 and four moderately active inhibitors (class 1), namely the 2-oxoamide inhibitor 1,5 and three diaryloxy-propan-2-one inhibitors (12β€“14)25,26 (Fig. 3A). The algorithm uses the information of medium active compounds to conduct a ranking of initially generated hypotheses. The hypotheses that map the highly active inhibitors and the moderately active inhibitors in consistency with their experimental data are prioritized. Additionally, four weakly active or inactive compounds (15β€“18), selected basically from the same chemical classes,25,26 were used for the steric refinement step (Fig. 3B). A summary of the training set compounds with the assigned activity classes is given in Table 1. The generation of 3D pharmacophore models resulted in ten hypotheses, of which seven models consisted of six features, two were composed of five features, and one of seven features, respectively.

In order to perform the theoretical evaluation of the generated hypotheses, a set of 12 highly active compounds that were not included in the training set was assembled (ig. 4). urthermore, reported 2 inhibitors were removed from the h. EMBL 03, a database of drugs and drug-like compounds with pharmacological activity notes.27 Afterwards, this database that consisted of 310732 unique entries was refined by applying a physicochemical property-based filter. In total, 1712 compounds similar in physicochemical properties to the highly active compounds were selected using a protocol in PipelinePilot 7.5,28 which is summarized in Table 2. The conformational models for this validation dataset were generated within Catalyst 4.11 with a maximum number of 100 conformations per molecule and β€�FASTβ€™ quality.

To experimentally evaluate the predictive power of the developed 3 pharmacophore model, the  database (247041 entries) was virtually screened.33 or the generation of the conformational models for the  compounds a maximum number of 100 conformations per molecule and β€�β€™ quality was employed. he virtual screening was performed using β€�fast flexible searchβ€™ and returned 185 hits (0.07%). or the selection of test compounds, we focused on (i) structurally diverse compounds, (ii) which were available at the time of our study, and (iii) which achieved high pharmacophore fit values. or assessment of c. PLA2Ξ± inhibition, a cell-free in vitro assay based on isolated human recombinant cPLA2Ξ± was used and the cPLA2Ξ± reference inhibitor N-{(2S,4R)-4-(biphenyl-2-ylmethyl-isobutyl-amino)-1-[2-(2,4-difluorobenzoyl)-benzoyl]-pyrrolidin-2-ylmethyl}-3-[4-(2,4-dioxothiazolidin-5-ylidenemethyl)-phenyl]acrylamide (compound 43) was used as control to validate the assay (for details see Supplementary data). Biological evaluation of 12 virtual hits showed that compound 31 (Fig. 7) inhibited isolated human recombinant cPLA2Ξ± in the cell-free assay with an IC50 value in the low micromolar range (IC50Β =Β 4Β ΞΌM; Supplementary data Fig. S1). All other compounds (32β€“42, Supplementary data Chart S1) failed to inhibit cPLA2Ξ± activity at a concentration of 10Β ΞΌM by more than 40%. Higher concentrations than 10Β ΞΌM were not tested due to poor solubility in the aqueous assay buffer. The novel bioactive compound 31 was further analyzed for inhibition of cPLA2Ξ±-mediated AA release in a cell-based model using Ca2+-ionophore A23187-stimulated human monocytes (for details see Supplementary data). In fact, 31 inhibited AA release from human monocytes with similar potency (IC50Β =Β 5Β ΞΌM; Supplementary data Fig. S1) as in the cell-free in vitro assay. Again, the cPLA2Ξ± reference inhibitor 43 inhibited AA release as expected (Supplementary data Fig. S1). Together, compound 31 can be considered as an interesting candidate for further chemical optimization to obtain potent inhibitors of eicosanoid-related inflammation and cancer.
