The direct oral factor Xa-inhibitors are at present in clinical use as antithrombotics, after their efficiency and safety have been proved in clinical studies. Three products are actually in the market, rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) apixaban (Eliquis®) and edoxaban (Lixiana®). Efficacy and safety have been tested for rivaroxaban and apixaban in large study programmes with more than 60'000 patients each. For edoxaban large phase III studies are under way. Based on these data rivaroxaban was registered in the EU and CH for primary prophylaxis against thrombosis after major orthopaedic surgery, such as hip- and knee-joint protheses, for treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and for prophylaxis against thromboembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban is presently registered in the EU and CH for prophylaxis against thrombosis after major orthopaedic surgery, Edoxaban is registered only in Japan for the same indication. These products have been shown to be non-inferior or superior compared with vitamin K antagonists or low-molecular weight heparins, they are administered once or twice a day, they do not need laboratory monitoring. But they have disadvantages also, they depend on renal clearance, they can interact with other medicaments and they lack a specific antidote. In total, though, they are considered as a progress for the appropriate patients in terms of quality of treatment.
