<abstract>
This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of Mediterranean to low-fat diets in overweight/obese individuals for the modification of cardiovascular risk factors demonstrates the superiority of Mediterranean over low-fat diets in improving control of most cardiovascular risk factors after a follow-up of 2 years. Although the incremental effects of Mediterranean diets on individual cardiovascular risk factors was modest, the consistent benefit over a broad range of established cardiovascular risk factors may result in a reduction of cardiovascular complications.
