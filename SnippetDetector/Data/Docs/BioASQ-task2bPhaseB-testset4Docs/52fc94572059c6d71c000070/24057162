Apixaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, and is a potential alternative for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban versus enoxaparin. A systematic search of the literature for randomized controlled trials of apixaban thromboprophylaxis versus enoxaparin was conducted using three databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Five studies that included a total of 12,938 patients were analyzed using Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. To evaluate efficacy, a composite of venous thromboembolism and death during follow-up was measured. To evaluate safety, major and total bleeding events were considered. The odds ratio (OR) for the composite outcome of efficacy was 0.66 (95 % CI 0.33-1.29) for apixaban compared to enoxaparin, while there was a similar risk of major bleeding (OR 1.03, 95 % CI 0.36-3.73) and total bleeding (OR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.64-1.20). These results suggest a lack of clear superiority of apixaban relative to enoxaparin. Apixaban is an oral alternative with similar efficacy and safety to existing anticoagulant therapies.
