This review highlights the role of delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of patients with nonischemic myocardial disease. The authors discuss the use of delayed enhancement for differentiation between ischemic and nonischemic myocardial disease and for narrowing the differential diagnosis when nonischemic etiologies are suspected. In addition, special focus is given to the prognostic applications of delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging.
