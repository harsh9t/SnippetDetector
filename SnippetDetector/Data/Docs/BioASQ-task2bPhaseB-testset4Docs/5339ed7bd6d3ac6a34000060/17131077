Patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy often represent a diagnostic challenge, and correct etiologic diagnosis may influence outcomes. Lately, delayed myocardial enhancement MR imaging has been developed and is currently being used for a growing number of clinical applications. On delayed enhancement MR images, scarring or fibrosis appears as an area of high signal intensity, and the pattern by which this enhancement occurs in the myocardium allows distinction of many different pathologies. In nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the delayed enhancement usually does not occur in a coronary artery distribution and is often midwall rather than subendocardial or transmural. It could also guide myocardial biopsy to an affected area, increasing its yield. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has now a definitive role in clinical practice, and its capability to non-invasively provide high resolution images of the heart with good tissue characterization is redefining the understanding of the conditions that can adversely affect the myocardium.
