BACKGROUND: The prognostic implications of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) have been evaluated in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The present study analyzed LGE distribution in patients with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ES-HCM) and with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and tried to identify high risk patients in DCM. METHODS: Eleven patients with ES-HCM and 72 with DCM underwent cine- and LGE-cardiac magnetic resonance and ultrasound cardiography. The patient outcome was analyzed retrospectively for 5years of follow-up. RESULTS: LGE distributed mainly in the inter-ventricular septum, but spread more diffusely into other left ventricular segments in patients with ES-HCM and in a certain part of patients with DCM. Thus, patients with DCM can be divided into three groups according to LGE distribution; no LGE (n=24), localized LGE (localized at septum, n=36), and extensive LGE (spread into other segments, n=12). Reverse remodeling occurred after treatment in patients with no LGE and with localized LGE, but did not in patients with extensive LGE and with ES-HCM. The event-free survival rate for composite outcome (cardiac death, hospitalization for decompensated heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias) was lowest in patients with extensive LGE (92%, 74% and 42% in no LGE, localized LGE, and extensive LGE, p=0.02 vs. no LGE), and was comparable to that in patients with ES-HCM (42%). CONCLUSIONS: In DCM, patients with extensive LGE showed no functional recovery and the lowest event-free survival rate that were comparable to patients with ES-HCM. The analysis of LGE distribution may be valuable to predict reverse remodeling and to identify high-risk patients.
