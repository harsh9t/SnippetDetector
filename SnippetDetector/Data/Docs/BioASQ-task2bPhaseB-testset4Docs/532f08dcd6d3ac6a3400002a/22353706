For more than 60 years, vitamin K antagonists have been the only available oral anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation (AF). Several new molecules, with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and avoiding routine monitoring, have been recently developed, opening a new era in anticoagulation. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the oral activated factor X inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, are the novel oral anticoagulants with data from large randomized clinical trials showing that these drugs are noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and thromboembolic complications of AF, with the advantage of less hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial bleeding. While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in "real-life" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated.
