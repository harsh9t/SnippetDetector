A patient on oral anticoagulation with dabigatran presented with chest pain and dyspnoea. A CT scan of the chest revealed an intramural haematoma of the ascending aorta with a large pericardial effusion. The patient underwent a modified Bentall procedure. In the absence of a specific antidote for this novel oral anticoagulant medication, even in an emergency situation, successful surgical treatment was possible with an aggressive use of available prohaemostatic agents.
