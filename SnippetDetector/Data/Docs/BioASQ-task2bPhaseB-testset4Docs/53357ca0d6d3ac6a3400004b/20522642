Reperfusion injury to tissue following an ischemic event occurs as a consequence of an acute inflammatory response that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Components of both the innate (complement, immunoglobulin, monocytes, and neutrophils) and adaptive (B and T lymphocytes) immune systems have been demonstrated to mediate tissue injury. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is responsible for membrane-mediated signaling in various cell types including B lymphocytes, macrophages, and T cells. We investigated the ability of a small drug Syk inhibitor, R788, to protect mice against mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced local (intestine) and remote lung injury. Mice were fed with chow containing a Syk inhibitor for 6 days before the performance of intestinal I/R, which resulted in silencing of the expression of the active phosphorylated Syk. Syk inhibition significantly suppressed both local and remote lung injury. The beneficial effect was associated with reduced IgM and complement 3 deposition in the tissues and significant reduction of polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. Our data place Syk upstream of events leading to the binding of natural antibodies to the ischemia-conditioned tissues and urge the consideration of the use of Syk inhibitors in the prevention or improvement of tissue injury of organs exposed to ischemia or hypoperfusion.
