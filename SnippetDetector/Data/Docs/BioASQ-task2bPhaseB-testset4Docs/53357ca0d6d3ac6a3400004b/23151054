A novel approach to design selective spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors is described. Inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase has attracted much attention as a mechanism for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and SLE. Fostamatinib, a Syk inhibitor that successfully completed phase II clinical trials, also exhibits some undesirable side effects. More selective Syk inhibitors could offer safer, alternative treatments. Through a systematic evaluation of the kinome, we identified Pro455 and Asn457 in the Syk ATP binding site as a rare combination among sequence aligned kinases and hypothesized that optimizing the interaction between them and a Syk inhibitor molecule would impart high selectivity for Syk over other kinases. We report the structure-guided identification of three series of selective spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors that support our hypothesis and offer useful guidance to other researchers in the field.
