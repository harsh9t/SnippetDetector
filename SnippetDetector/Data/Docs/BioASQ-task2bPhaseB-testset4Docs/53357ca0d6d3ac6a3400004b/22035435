<abstract>
Three major advances over the last decade have impacted the way we treat rheumatoid arthritis; early and aggressive treatment, use of disease activity measures leading to treat to target, and availability of biologic agents. No oral biologic agents are available at this time but promising data is emerging for two drugs, tofacitinib and fostamatinib, inhibitors of JAK and Syk kinases, respectively. This paper will review some of the relevant published data for these  agents and discuss where they may be placed in our treatment options for RA.
