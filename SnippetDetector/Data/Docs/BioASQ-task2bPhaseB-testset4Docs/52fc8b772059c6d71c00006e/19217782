COT (Tpl2 in mice) is a serine/threonine MAP3 kinase that regulates production of TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta via the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. As TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are clinically validated targets for therapeutic intervention in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), blocking COT provides a potential avenue for amelioration of disease. Herein we describe identification of a cellular active selective small molecule inhibitor of COT kinase.
