Myocardial fibrosis can occur in patients who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the absence of epicardial coronary disease. In such patients, myocardial fibrosis has been linked to a poorer prognosis than in those without fibrosis. Gadolinium-DTPA delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (de-MRI) accurately identifies regions of myocardial fibrosis. We used de-MRI to screen for myocardial fibrosis in 8 patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that had been diagnosed by 2-dimensional echocardiography. After localization of the heart and acquisition of electrocardiographically gated cine images, gadolinium-DTPA (0.2 mmol/kg) was administered to the patient. Fifteen minutes later, de-MRI images were obtained using a T1-weighted, inversion-recovery fast, low-angle shot sequence. Images were gated to end-diastole and obtained during a single breath-hold. The inversion time was modified iteratively to obtain maximal nulling of the signal from the ventricular myocardium. Regions of myocardium with abnormally high signals (>300% of remote normal myocardium) were designated as fibrotic. Eight patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent de-MRI. The mean age was 52 years, the mean left ventricular mass was 201 grams, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.68. In the 6 patients with recent clinical deterioration, de-MRI showed clearly delineated areas of myocardial fibrosis; no such areas were seen in the 2 asymptomatic patients. We conclude that patients with symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy display regions of abnormal signal intensity on de-MRI that likely represent fibrosis. This technique may provide useful information in the evaluation of such patients and warrants further study.
