BACKGROUND: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has been shown to be associated with ventricular arrhythmias, however, its prognostic role in predicting sudden cardiac death has not yet been established. AIM: To explore a potential relationship between LGE visualised by CMR and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: The LGE in CMR was assessed in 55 HCM patients. We compared the frequency and extent of LGE in HCM patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or who survived ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sudden death [group VF (+)] versus HCM patients without these tachyarrhythmias [group VF (-)]. There were 14 patients in the VF (+) group and 41 patients in the VF (-) group, and they were followed for a mean period of 37 months. RESULTS: In group VF (+), adequate ICD intervention occurred in 9 patients (8 patients with VF and one patient with sustained VT), and VF arrest occurred in 5 patients (4 patients were resuscitated and one patient had a witnessed sudden death). In group VF (+) all patients had LGE whereas in group VF (-) 85% patients presented this abnormality (p = 0.13). Moreover, there were no statistical differences between groups in the following parameters: age, total left ventricular (LV) mass, maximal LV wall thickness, mass of hyperenhanced myocardium and percent of hyperenhanced myocardium. CONCLUSION: In HCM patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia LGE was both qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with patients without these tachyarrhythmias.
