BACKGROUND: On the past decade a plethora of investigations were directed on identification of molecules involved in breast tumorogenesis, which could represent a powerful tool for monitoring, diagnostics and treatment of this disease. In current study we analyzed six previously identified medullary breast carcinoma autoantigens including LGALS3BP, RAD50, FAM50A, RBPJ, PABPC4, LRRFIP1 with cancer restricted serological profile in different histological types of breast cancer. METHODS: Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of 20 tissue samples including medullary breast carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissues obtained from patients with fibrocystic disease (each of five) was performed using specifically generated polyclonal antibodies. Differences in expression patterns were evaluated considering percent of positively stained cells, insensitivity of staining and subcellular localization in cells of all tissue samples. RESULTS: All 6 antigens predominantly expressed in the most cells of all histological types of breast tumors and non-cancerous tissues with slight differences in intensity of staining and subcellular localization. The most significant differences in expression pattern were revealed for RAD50 and LGALS3BP in different histological types of breast cancer and for PABPC4 and FAM50A antigens in immune cells infiltrating breast tumors. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study made possible to select 4 antigens LGALS3BP, RAD50, PABPC4, and FAM50A as promising candidates for more comprehensive research as potential molecular markers for breast cancer diagnostics and therapy.

Methods
linicopathological data. Fresh breast cancer and non-cancerous breast tissue (NCT) samples were obtained from 15 female patients (39β€“75 years) with primary breast carcinoma and 5 patients with fibrocystic disease (37β€“50 years) correspondingly, who underwent surgery in the Dnipropetrovsk Clinical Oncological Center (Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine) between 2008 and 2010. Surgical specimens were fixed with 10% buffered formalin, and paraffin embedded sections were stained with hematoxilin and eosin. All the tissue sample sections were reviewed to confirm the original diagnosis by an expert pathologist. The clinical and histopathological characteristics of these patients are shown in Table
1. Breast cancer cases included invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (nβ€‰=β€‰5), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (nβ€‰=β€‰5), and medullary carcinoma (nβ€‰=β€‰5). Clinicopathological data were obtained from patient medical records and from the files kept at the Department of Pathohistology of Dnipropetrovsk Clinical Oncological Center. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, NAS of Ukraine and informed consent was obtained from all patients.Table 1Characteristics of patients and their tissue samplesΒ IDC (nβ€‰=β€‰5)ILC (nβ€‰=β€‰5)MBC (nβ€‰=β€‰5)NCT (nβ€‰=β€‰5)Age (mean)48.465.85344.8Age range39-7347-7541-7137-50ER-positive340n/aPR-positive240n/aHER2-positive320n/aNode positive330n/aKi-67 expression (range)13-68%8-29%n/an/aCloning, expression and purification of recombinant proteinsSpecific cDNA of LGALS3BP, RAD50, FAM50A, RBPJ, PABPC4 and LRRFIP1 genes, isolated from MBC cDNA library Br502, was cloned into pGEX4T3 and/or pET28b expression vectors, containing glutathione-S-transferase- and 6His-tags respectively (Table
2). Expression of fused recombinant proteins was induced by 1 mM IPTG at 37Β°C for 4 h in E.coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE cells transformed by correspondent recombinant plasmids. Proteins were affinity purified using GST-sepharose and Ni-NTA-agarose according to manufacturersβ€™ protocols. Some expressed recombinant proteins were present in the inclusion bodies of the pellet, which were washed before the purification procedure according X.A. Yang protocol
[36]. Purity of proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All proteins were dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH7.4, and then were used for immunization of mice.

A primary dose of 20 mkg of each recombinant polypeptide was solubilized in Freundβ€™s complete adjuvant (Sigma, Aldrich, Germany) and administered intraperitoneally in six- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice four times at 2-week intervals. Then, immunized mice (with serum titer no less than 105β€“106) were boosted with 20 mkg of antigen in PBS by intraperitoneal injection. After 3 days of the booster injection, blood was collected from the mice, and the serum was separated.Specificity of generated polyclonal antibodies was tested by Western blotting of recombinant proteins and confirmed by immunohystochemical analysis of MBC tumor, which was taken for generation of MBC cDNA library Br502 [37] with depleted against corresponding recombinant proteins polyclonal antibodies. Depletion of polyclonal antibody was performed as follows: antibodies diluted (1:10) in PBS were incubated overnight with correspondent recombinant proteins (10 mkg) transferred on PVDF membranes by standard blotting procedure. Decreasing of the intensity of immunohistochemical staining of Br502 tumor sections, when depleted antibody were used evidenced for specificity of generated polyclonal antibodies compared with undepleted ones.Immunohistochemical analysisImmunohistochemical analysis of breast cancer samples with polyclonal Abs was performed according to standard protocol. Briefly, representative sections of breast tumors were prepared from parafin blocks. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with H2O2 (3%) in 0.01% PBS. After blocking of non-specific binding with avidin-biotin blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4Β°C with corresponded polyclonal antibodies (1:400). Then, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature at 1:400 dilutions (goat anti-mouse biotinylated IgG, Sigma, Steinheim, Germany), followed by incubation with avidin-biotinperoxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min at RT and developed with diaminobenzidine solution. Serum from non-immune mouse was used as negative control. Immunohistochemical staining of all breast cancer and non-cancerous tissue slides was performed during one experiment in equal conditions for each of antigens analyzed. Haematoxylin was used for counterstaining. Standard microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Universal microscope (Zeiss, Germany), and images were captured using digital Axiocam software.Taking into account the fact that the expression of the studied antigens in normal and tumor breast tissues are poorly studied, we evaluated the staining intensity for each antigen comparing the slides of non-cancerous and cancerous breast tissue samples of different histological types, which were processed with correspondent polyclonal antibody under the same conditions. Tissue slides were analyzed using a four point semi-quantitative scale for nuclear and cytoplasmic optical staining intensity (graded as 3+ (strong), 2+ (moderate), 1+ (weak), 0 (no staining)) and for the percentage of positively stained cells (0β€‰β€“β€‰no staining, 1β€‰β€“β€‰<10% of the cells, 2β€‰β€“β€‰11β€‰β€“β€‰50% of the cells, 3β€‰β€“β€‰>50% of the cells). Pathologist marked biologically representative areas, which contained a mean number of 150 cells (min 72 β€“ max 180), percentage of positive cells was assessed as percent of cells exhibiting reactivity as average in 10 fields at high magnification (x400). The area of interest was selected randomly, excluding stromal cells and artifacts. Staining intensity and percent reactivity were recorded as mean observed in ten high power fields. The same slides were viewed again by each one of 3 month later, independently of the first vision.

Analysis of FAM50A protein expression revealed that more than 50% of cells were positively stained in cancer and non-cancerous tissue sets (Figure

LRRFIP1 nuclear and cytoplasmic expression was indicated in more than 50% of all tissue samples (Figure

[41,42,44-46]. Taking this fact into account we performed immunohistochemical analysis of tumor regions of all MBC and 1 case of IDC highly infiltrated by lypmphocytes, with correspondent polyclonal antibodies. We have shown that all proteins expressed in the most of immune cells of lymphocytic infiltrate (up to 90%) (Table

Discussion
he identification of breast cancer markers has been the focus of extensive research in past decades, there still an urgent need for good cancer biomarkers remains. oreover, characterization of these proteins and identification of the alterations that distinguish cancer cells from normal ones will help to understand the molecular mechanisms of cancerogenesis. n previous study we identified by -approach 41 novel medullary breast carcinoma autoantigens, 18 of which had cancer-related serological profile
[35]. uring this study expression pattern of 6 from 18 potential -derived antigens were studied by immunohistochemistry in tissue samples obtained from patients with different histological types of breast cancer and fibrocystic disease using specifically generated polyclonal antibodies. edullary breast carcinoma, lobular and ductal invasive breast carcinomasβ€™ tissue samples were taken for immunohistochemical investigation of expression patterns of above mentioned proteins. tβ€™s known that lobular and ductal carcinomas derive both from the breast terminal duct lobular units
[47] and the terminology β€�ductalβ€� and β€�lobularβ€� is still being used for historical reasons and to date there is no evidence to suggest that these tumors arise from ductal or lobular epithelial cells. hus, the differences in their morphology are likely to reflect the different mechanisms of carcinogenesis rather than the anatomical origin of the lesions
[48]. or example, it was demonstrated that 5.8% of the transcriptionally regulated genes were differentially expressed in s compared to grade- and molecular subtype-matched s
[49]. dentification and characterization of molecular targets specific for each type of breast cancer will help to design more precise therapeutic and diagnostic approaches for curing of this type of malignancy.
uring this preliminary study, we investigated expression pattern of 6  autoantigens, including secretory protein 3, 2 nuclear proteins (50, 50), one cytoplasmic protein (4) and 2 tratscription factors (, 1), in different histological types of breast cancer and non-cancerous tissue samples by immunohistochemical analysis. espite the fact that automated measurement using digital slide scanners and computer-aid methods are increasingly used for immunohystochemical analysis, during this study we used visual semi-quantitative evaluation of  antigens expression pattern by expert pathologist because high correlation between these two approaches was recently shown
[50-52].
t was shown that all analyzed proteins expressed in the most cells of non-cancerous and cancer tissue samples. owever distinct expression pattern was revealed for some antigens in breast carcinomas of different histological types.
3 (also known as -2 and 90 protein) was originally identified as a tumor-associated antigen in the culture supernatant of human breast cancer cells
[53]. arly works focused on study of 3 showed its expression in more than 80% of breast cancer tissues, but not in non-cancerous normal mammary gland surrounding the cancer cells
[53]. mmunohistochemical analysis of 3 expression in several tumors, including breast carcinomas, revealed 3 positive staining predominantly in cytoplasm
[54]. uring our study, we also, observed moderate to strong 3 positive staining in cytoplasm and weak nuclear staining of  and  cells. nterestingly, that in  tumors we detected opposite pattern of 3 expression with moderate nuclear and weak cytoplasmic staining. oreover, during this study we observed an explicit apical membrane staining of 3 in some of epithelial cells in breast tissues of patients with fibrocystic disease and epithelial cells lining the normal ducts in s, contrary to mentioned above literature data
[53]. his strong apical membrane staining of 3 may partly be explained by its ability to be secreted by different types of cells including epithelial cells
[55-57].
50 is a highly conserved  double-strand break repair factor
[39]. ts aberrantly reduced protein expression was reported in 3% of breast tumors (predominantly //2 triple-negative and higher-grade familial breast tumors)
[57]. n our investigation we also showed strong 50 nuclear staining of non-cancerous and cancer cells. owever, in 4 from 5  cases we observed rather moderate than strong 50 positive staining in the nucleus of cancer cells. ince, down-regulation of some genes including 50 was shown in s
[49]; our results partially confirmed the data about reduced 50 expression in  tumors. owever, this fact should to be further investigated on a large number of samples.
50 (also known as 5) is a poorly studied protein with unknown function having signal for nuclear localization
[40]. ere, we describe for the first time its subcellular localization and expression pattern in cancer and non-cancerous breast tissues. ccording to our findings 50 protein is expressed both in nucleus and cytoplasm in the most cells of cancer and non-cancerous breast tissues without any significant differences. owever we found stronger 50 nuclear staining in immunocytes compared with cancer and non-cancerous breast cells.
4 (or inducible  (i. PABP)) a homolog of PABP, have critical roles in RNA processing beyond simply binding to poly(A) sequences
[41]. According to the literature data PABPC4 is a diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localized to stress granules
[58]; its expression is induced upon stimulation of peripheral T cells
[41]. The fact that induction of PABPC4 coincides with the induction of lymphokine mRNA in activated T cells suggests that perhaps iPABP is necessary for regulation of stability of labile mRNA species
[41]. In our study, we observed moderate to strong PABPC4 positive staining in cytoplasm in the most of cancer and normal cells of all tissue samples and in part of immunocytes. One may be speculated that PABPC4 expression can be restricted to activated T cells at least in MBC tumors, and possibly contributes to a more effective immune response that can be associated with good prognosis for patients with this tumor type. However, to confirm this assumption additional study has to be performed.
RBPJ is a primary transcription mediator of canonical Notch signaling
[59], which participates in cell fate determination, and is involved in the regulation of tumor behavior in multiple decisions
[60]. It has been shown previously, that RBPJ protein can be detected in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm and it subcellular distribution changes in defined physiological contexts
[61-64].
In all cancer and non-cancerous cases predominantly moderate nuclear RBPJ and weak cytoplasmic staining was detected, however in some MBC and IDC cases strong nuclear staining was revealed. These differences may be associated with histological and molecular features of these tumor types.
LRRFIP1 is ubiquitously expressed and found in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments
[65]. This protein acts as transcriptional repressor of some genes
[45,46,66] and indirectly throught interaction with Flightless 1 protein involved in actin severing, capping and cytoskeletal rearrangement
[67]. Notably, LRRFIP1 can be mutated in breast tumors and soft tissue sarcomas
[68], and may be involved in the regulation of cell growth
[43]. We observed strong nuclear and weak cytoplasmic distribution of LRRFIP1 in cancer and normal cells except for MBC tumors, which showed moderate cytoplasmic staining in addition to strong nuclear staining.
Thus, during this study we described for the first time expression patterns of 6 potential MBC-associated antigens, including LGALS3BP, RAD50, FAM50A, RBPJ, PABPC4, LRRFIP1 in different histological types of breast carcinomas and non-cancerous breast tissues by immunohistochemical analysis. Our data indicate that all 6 antigens predominantly expressed in the most cells of all histological types of breast tumors, non-cancerous tissues, and immunocytes with slight differences in intensity of staining and subcellular localization. The most significant differences were observed for RAD50 and LGALS3BP antigens in different histological types of breast carcinomas. During this study we described for the first time expression pattern of poorly studied antigen FAM50A and observed its more intensive nuclear staining in the immune cells compared with cancer and non-cancerous cells. Additionally increased expression of other antigen PABPC4 was observed in restricted number of immune cells infiltrating breast tumors. These observations possibly reflect molecular changes that occur during breast carcinogenesis in different histological types of breast cancer and indicate that RAD50 and LGALS3BP antigens are promising candidates for more comprehensive research as potential molecular markers for breast cancer diagnostics and therapy. Moreover, antigens FAM50A and PABPC4 are intriguing targets for investigation of the features of the immune response in patients with highly infiltrating breast tumors including MBC, which despite anaplastic features has favorable prognosis.
