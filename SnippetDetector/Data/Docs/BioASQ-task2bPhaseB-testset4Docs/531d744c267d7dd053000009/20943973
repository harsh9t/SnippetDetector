The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins are critical to the immortalization of keratinocytes. HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6 interacts with endogenous proteins to activate hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, thus avoiding cellular senescence signals. NFX1-123, the longer splice variant of NFX1, interacts with HPV16 E6, as well as cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins 1 and 4 (PABPC1 and PABPC4). HPV16 E6 affects hTERT expression posttranscriptionally through NFX1-123, as NFX1-123 interacts with hTERT mRNA and stabilizes it, leading to greater telomerase activity. The PAM2 motif of NFX1-123, with which it binds PABPCs, is required for the posttranscriptional regulation of hTERT by HPV16 E6 and NFX1-123. There is increasing evidence that RNA and DNA viruses utilize RNA-processing proteins, and specifically PABPCs, in the normal virus life cycle, and there is also evidence that RNA-processing proteins are perturbed in cancers. Here, we show that PABPCs are critical in hTERT regulation by HPV16 E6. Although the amount and cellular localization of PABPCs were largely unchanged in cervical cancer cell lines with or without HPV16 and in human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) with or without HPV16 E6, knockdown of PABPCs decreased hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity and overexpression of PABPC4 increased these in HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. In contrast, knockdown of PABPCs in C33A cells had no effect on hTERT mRNA or telomerase activity. Additionally, overexpression of PABPC4 and hTERT led to greater growth of cultured HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. This is the first evidence that PABPCs have a targeted role in hTERT regulation leading to a growth advantage in cells expressing HPV16 E6.
