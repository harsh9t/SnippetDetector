<abstract>
DNA repair has an essential role in protecting the genome from damage by endogenous and environmental agents. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and differences in repair capacity between individuals have been widely documented. For colorectal cancer, the loss of mismatch repair gene activity is a key genetic determinant. Nucleotide excision repair (NER), recombination repair (RR) and base excision repair (BER) pathways have critical roles in protection against other cancers, and we wished to investigate their role in colorectal cancer. We have compared the frequency of polymorphisms in the NER genes, XPD, XPF, XPG, ERCC1; in the BER gene, XRCC1; and in the RR gene, XRCC3; in colorectal cancer patients and in a control group. No significant associations were found for any of the NER gene polymorphisms or for the XRCC1 polymorphism. The C allele (position 18067) of the XRCC3 gene was weakly but significantly associated with colorectal cancer (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.22, P=0.03). For all patients who were heterozygous for any of the repair genes studied, tumour tissue was investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Only one example of LOH was found for all the genes examined. From the association and LOH data, we conclude that these genes do not have an important role in protection against colorectal carcinogenesis.

Several complementary  repair mechanisms have evolved to protect the genome from  damage caused by endogenous or environmental agents, which could lead to mutations and carcinogenesis (riedberg, 2001).  repair capacity varies between individuals in the general population (for a review, see erwick and ineis, 2000). n increasing number of  repair gene polymorphisms are being described and their involvement in carcinogenesis is being investigated. or colorectal cancer, the importance of mutations in mismatch repair () genes has been extensively documented.  gene defects account for 15% of sporadic colorectal cancer, and germline mutations in  genes are the cause of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (for a review, see iricny and ystrom-ahti, 2000). he role of additional low-penetrance genes in colorectal cancer susceptibility has been recently reviewed (de ong et al, 2002). e wished to investigate the hypothesis that alterations in other  repair pathways were also important genetic determinants of colorectal carcinogenesis.Several complementary DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to protect the genome from DNA damage caused by endogenous or environmental agents, which could lead to mutations and carcinogenesis (Friedberg, 2001). DNA repair capacity varies between individuals in the general population (for a review, see Berwick and Vineis, 2000). An increasing number of DNA repair gene polymorphisms are being described and their involvement in carcinogenesis is being investigated. For colorectal cancer, the importance of mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes has been extensively documented. MMR gene defects account for 15% of sporadic colorectal cancer, and germline mutations in MMR genes are the cause of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (for a review, see Jiricny and Nystrom-Lahti, 2000). The role of additional low-penetrance genes in colorectal cancer susceptibility has been recently reviewed (de Jong et al, 2002). We wished to investigate the hypothesis that alterations in other DNA repair pathways were also important genetic determinants of colorectal carcinogenesis.

The nucleotide excision repair () pathway deals with  light-induced  damage (for a review, see ood, 1997). n the inherited disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum,  deficiency results in a 1000-fold increased incidence of skin cancer, but also a 20-fold increase in internal tumours (riedberg et al, 1995), indicating that  is also important in the repair of endogenous  damage. ndeed, the digestive tract contains materials such as lipid peroxidation by-products that can react with  to generate bulky adducts that are recognised by  (riedberg et al, 1995). mino-acid variants in  genes are common in the general population (hen et al, 1998) and some, such as the  exon 23 polymorphism, have been associated with reduced  repair capacity (unn et al, 2000; iao et al, 2002). e have reported a significant association between polymorphisms in exons 6, 22 and 23 of the  gene and melanoma in patients under 50 (omescu et al, 2001). ignificant association between  gene polymorphisms and other cancers, but not colorectal, have also been reported: glioma (hen et al, 2000); lung (hen et al, 2002; ark et al, 2002); squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (; turgis et al, 2002).The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway deals with UV light-induced DNA damage (for a review, see Wood, 1997). In the inherited disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum, NER deficiency results in a 1000-fold increased incidence of skin cancer, but also a 20-fold increase in internal tumours (Friedberg et al, 1995), indicating that NER is also important in the repair of endogenous DNA damage. Indeed, the digestive tract contains materials such as lipid peroxidation by-products that can react with DNA to generate bulky adducts that are recognised by NER (Friedberg et al, 1995). Amino-acid variants in NER genes are common in the general population (Shen et al, 1998) and some, such as the XPD exon 23 polymorphism, have been associated with reduced DNA repair capacity (Lunn et al, 2000; Qiao et al, 2002). We have reported a significant association between polymorphisms in exons 6, 22 and 23 of the XPD gene and melanoma in patients under 50 (Tomescu et al, 2001). Significant association between NER gene polymorphisms and other cancers, but not colorectal, have also been reported: glioma (Chen et al, 2000); lung (Chen et al, 2002; Park et al, 2002); squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN; Sturgis et al, 2002).

The 1 gene is involved in the repair of single-strand  breaks and in base excision repair () of damaged bases caused by endogenous and exogenous oxidants, including tobacco smoke. 1 polymorphisms have been associated with  (turgis et al, 1999), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (uell et al, 2002), lung cancer (hen et al, 2002) and bladder cancer (tern et al, 2002). here is also a single report of a significant association with colorectal cancer (reviewed by de ong et al, 2002). he 3 gene, a paralogue of 51, is involved in recombination repair () and is required for genome stability (riffin et al, 2000). 3 polymorphisms have been associated with melanoma (insey et al, 2000), bladder cancer (atullo et al, 2001a; tern et al, 2002) and  (hen et al, 2002).The XRCC1 gene is involved in the repair of single-strand DNA breaks and in base excision repair (BER) of damaged bases caused by endogenous and exogenous oxidants, including tobacco smoke. XRCC1 polymorphisms have been associated with SCCHN (Sturgis et al, 1999), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Duell et al, 2002), lung cancer (Chen et al, 2002) and bladder cancer (Stern et al, 2002). There is also a single report of a significant association with colorectal cancer (reviewed by de Jong et al, 2002). The XRCC3 gene, a paralogue of RAD51, is involved in recombination repair (RR) and is required for genome stability (Griffin et al, 2000). XRCC3 polymorphisms have been associated with melanoma (Winsey et al, 2000), bladder cancer (Matullo et al, 2001a; Stern et al, 2002) and SCCHN (Shen et al, 2002).

ubjects. Subjects were colorectal cancer patients (mean age 69 years) attending the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK. Biopsy material, from cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissue, was collected between 1994 and 1997 by Professor Andrew Wyllie for histology and DNA extraction. At the same time, control blood samples were selected entirely at random from donors to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (mean age of donors is 42 years), and DNA was extracted as described (Tomescu et al, 2001).PCR and RFLP assaysThe polymorphisms studied are shown in Table 1

All, apart from the XPG exon 15 polymorphism (Emmert et al, 2001), were originally described by Shen et al (1998). Polymorphisms were chosen for study because, in each case, the variant allele was common and the single-nucleotide change resulted in the gain, or loss, of a restriction site so that the polymorphism could be easily typed by PCR and RFLP analysis. In addition, significant associations between some of these polymorphisms and cancer have previously been reported. Details of the RFLPs are shown in Table 1.

Having confirmed that this was the case, we assumed that alleles were independent at each locus, and compared allele counts among cases and controls. A Ο‡2-test with Yates' correction was used to give a conservative test for the significance of any association between a polymorphism and colorectal cancer.

From these 149 heterozygous loci examined, only a single example of LOH was found. This occurred for an XRCC3 exon 7 CT heterozygote where the C allele was absent in the tumour (Figure 1).

e have investigated the hypothesis that  gene polymorphisms might predispose to colorectal cancer because some forms of the encoded proteins may be less efficient at repairing  damage arising from exposure of the gut epithelium to genotoxic compounds in the lumen.  is known to be active against a range of bulky  lesions in addition to its main role in the repair of -induced  damage. n a small study, we have previously shown a significant association between melanoma and three polymorphisms in the  gene (exon 6 (position 22541)  allele; exon 22 (position 35326)  allele; exon 23 (position 35931)  allele) that did not extend to markers flanking the  gene (omescu et al, 2001).  similar association for the  exons 6 and 23 polymorphisms has been found in some other, but not all, skin cancer studies (for a review, see enhamou and arasin, 2002). n some studies, the protein encoded by the  exon 23 allele (ys β†’ ln change) has been associated with reduced  repair activity (for a review, see enhamou and arasin, 2002). he  exon 23 polymorphism has also been associated with lung cancer (hen et al, 2002) and an exon 10 polymorphism with  (turgis et al, 2002).  polymorphism in the 3β€²  of 1 (not the exon 4  studied here) has been associated with glioma (hen et al, 2000) and  (turgis et al, 2002) and two  polymorphisms are associated with lung cancer (ark et al, 2002). ome of the polymorphisms we have studied lead to a change in the encoded protein ( exon 23 ys-ln;  exon 15 sp-is; 3 exon 7 hr-et), others are silent ( exons 6 and 22;  exon 11; 1 exon 4; 1 exon 17).  significant association between a protein variant and cancer only indicates that the change might be causative. n association with a silent change indicates that the causative change is closely linked, but remains to be identified. o significant association was found between any of the  gene polymorphisms studied and colorectal cancer. hile this does not exclude the possibility that  gene polymorphisms might make a minor contribution to genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer, a much larger study than the present one would be required to identify such a minor risk factor.
imilarly, although polymorphisms in exons 6 and 10 of the 1 gene, that is involved in  and the repair of single-strand  breaks, have been associated with colorectal cancer (reviewed in de ong et al, 2002) and a range of other internal cancers (turgis et al, 1999; hen et al, 2002; uell et al, 2002; tern et al, 2002), no association was seen in our study between the 1 exon 17 polymorphism and colorectal cancer.
 significant association was found for the recombinational repair gene, 3, where the exon 7  (position 18067, hr) allele showed a modest ( 1.52), but significant (=0.03) over-representation in 123 colorectal cancer patients compared to 128 controls. his 3 exon 7 polymorphism has previously shown a significant association with melanoma (insey et al, 2000), bladder cancer (atullo et al, 2001a) and  (hen et al, 2002). owever, in these studies, it was the variant  (et) allele that was over-represented in the cancer patients and this allele has also been associated with a reduced  repair phenotype (atullo et al, 2001b).
onflicting data from association studies between  repair gene polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility, or  repair capacity, are not unusual (e.g. see enhamou and arasin, 2002, for a review of the  data) and many probably result from insufficient sample sizes or inappropriate choice of controls in some studies. owever, elson et al (2002) have considered how studies on  repair gene polymorphisms can produce reliable, but opposite, associations in different types of cancer. he example they considered was the 1 rg399ln polymorphism. hey suggest that the outcome of a repair variant in a cell may depend on the selection pressures exerted on that cell. f the polymorphism results in reduced repair efficiency, the resultant increased levels of  damage may lead to an increased rate of apoptosis. uch a polymorphism would be associated with increased cancer risk in nondividing, or β€�apoptosis-abrogatedβ€™ cells and reduced cancer risk in cells with the capacity for apoptosis. elson et al (2002) also highlight that high  exposure to the skin results in p53 mutant cells which do not apoptose. he variant 3 exon 7β€‰ allele with reduced repair capacity could result in an increased cancer risk in the skin (by the fixation of mutations in p53 mutant cells) and a protective effect in the gut (by more efficient apoptosis).
he mechanism for the reduced repair capacity associated with the variant 3 exon 7β€‰ allele is unknown. t may alter the protein's interaction with 51, but could also affect other aspects of the role of 3. his highlights the main difficulty with studies designed to look at single polymorphisms without knowledge of their functional significance. ithout detailed knowledge of 3's roles in  repair, it is hard to evaluate the significance of such studies, or exclude a role for confounding factors. n the same way as we have done for  and melanoma (omescu et al, 2001), study of 3 flanking markers will be required to rule out roles for linkage disequilibrium and population stratification in the association found.
ur study suggested that  of  genes and 1 and 3 does not play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. ndeed, only a single example of  was found (for 3) in 149 heterozygous loci examined. n addition to reporting a high rate of  for  genes in ovarian and lung cancer, akebayashi et al (2001) reported  for  genes in 16.7% of colon carcinomas. loser examination of their data reveals that this equates to  for  in a single patient and  for  and  in a second patient, from a total of 12 patients examined and eight  genes typed (44 out of 96 assays were noninformative). hus, the two studies are in agreement that the frequency of  for  genes is low in colorectal cancer.
n conclusion, association and  studies suggest that  genes are not important genetic determinants for colorectal carcinogenesis.  modest association between colorectal cancer and a polymorphism in the recombination repair gene 3 was found, but additional studies will be required to evaluate its importance.DISCUSSION
We have investigated the hypothesis that NER gene polymorphisms might predispose to colorectal cancer because some forms of the encoded proteins may be less efficient at repairing DNA damage arising from exposure of the gut epithelium to genotoxic compounds in the lumen. NER is known to be active against a range of bulky DNA lesions in addition to its main role in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. In a small study, we have previously shown a significant association between melanoma and three polymorphisms in the XPD gene (exon 6 (position 22541) A allele; exon 22 (position 35326) C allele; exon 23 (position 35931) A allele) that did not extend to markers flanking the XPD gene (Tomescu et al, 2001). A similar association for the XPD exons 6 and 23 polymorphisms has been found in some other, but not all, skin cancer studies (for a review, see Benhamou and Sarasin, 2002). In some studies, the protein encoded by the XPD exon 23A allele (Lys β†’ Gln change) has been associated with reduced DNA repair activity (for a review, see Benhamou and Sarasin, 2002). The XPD exon 23 polymorphism has also been associated with lung cancer (Chen et al, 2002) and an exon 10 polymorphism with SCCHN (Sturgis et al, 2002). A polymorphism in the 3β€² UTR of ERCC1 (not the exon 4 RFLP studied here) has been associated with glioma (Chen et al, 2000) and SCCHN (Sturgis et al, 2002) and two XPA polymorphisms are associated with lung cancer (Park et al, 2002). Some of the polymorphisms we have studied lead to a change in the encoded protein (XPD exon 23 Lys-Gln; XPG exon 15 Asp-His; XRCC3 exon 7 Thr-Met), others are silent (XPD exons 6 and 22; XPF exon 11; ERCC1 exon 4; XRCC1 exon 17). A significant association between a protein variant and cancer only indicates that the change might be causative. An association with a silent change indicates that the causative change is closely linked, but remains to be identified. No significant association was found between any of the NER gene polymorphisms studied and colorectal cancer. While this does not exclude the possibility that NER gene polymorphisms might make a minor contribution to genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer, a much larger study than the present one would be required to identify such a minor risk factor.
Similarly, although polymorphisms in exons 6 and 10 of the XRCC1 gene, that is involved in BER and the repair of single-strand DNA breaks, have been associated with colorectal cancer (reviewed in de Jong et al, 2002) and a range of other internal cancers (Sturgis et al, 1999; Chen et al, 2002; Duell et al, 2002; Stern et al, 2002), no association was seen in our study between the XRCC1 exon 17 polymorphism and colorectal cancer.
A significant association was found for the recombinational repair gene, XRCC3, where the exon 7 C (position 18067, Thr) allele showed a modest (OR 1.52), but significant (P=0.03) over-representation in 123 colorectal cancer patients compared to 128 controls. This XRCC3 exon 7 polymorphism has previously shown a significant association with melanoma (Winsey et al, 2000), bladder cancer (Matullo et al, 2001a) and SCCHN (Shen et al, 2002). However, in these studies, it was the variant T (Met) allele that was over-represented in the cancer patients and this allele has also been associated with a reduced DNA repair phenotype (Matullo et al, 2001b).
Conflicting data from association studies between DNA repair gene polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility, or DNA repair capacity, are not unusual (e.g. see Benhamou and Sarasin, 2002, for a review of the XPD data) and many probably result from insufficient sample sizes or inappropriate choice of controls in some studies. However, Nelson et al (2002) have considered how studies on DNA repair gene polymorphisms can produce reliable, but opposite, associations in different types of cancer. The example they considered was the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism. They suggest that the outcome of a repair variant in a cell may depend on the selection pressures exerted on that cell. If the polymorphism results in reduced repair efficiency, the resultant increased levels of DNA damage may lead to an increased rate of apoptosis. Such a polymorphism would be associated with increased cancer risk in nondividing, or β€�apoptosis-abrogatedβ€™ cells and reduced cancer risk in cells with the capacity for apoptosis. Nelson et al (2002) also highlight that high UV exposure to the skin results in p53 mutant cells which do not apoptose. The variant XRCC3 exon 7β€‰T allele with reduced repair capacity could result in an increased cancer risk in the skin (by the fixation of mutations in p53 mutant cells) and a protective effect in the gut (by more efficient apoptosis).
The mechanism for the reduced repair capacity associated with the variant XRCC3 exon 7β€‰T allele is unknown. It may alter the protein's interaction with RAD51, but could also affect other aspects of the role of XRCC3. This highlights the main difficulty with studies designed to look at single polymorphisms without knowledge of their functional significance. Without detailed knowledge of XRCC3's roles in DNA repair, it is hard to evaluate the significance of such studies, or exclude a role for confounding factors. In the same way as we have done for XPD and melanoma (Tomescu et al, 2001), study of XRCC3 flanking markers will be required to rule out roles for linkage disequilibrium and population stratification in the association found.
Our study suggested that LOH of NER genes and XRCC1 and XRCC3 does not play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Indeed, only a single example of LOH was found (for XRCC3) in 149 heterozygous loci examined. In addition to reporting a high rate of LOH for NER genes in ovarian and lung cancer, Takebayashi et al (2001) reported LOH for NER genes in 16.7% of colon carcinomas. Closer examination of their data reveals that this equates to LOH for XPE in a single patient and LOH for XPB and XPE in a second patient, from a total of 12 patients examined and eight NER genes typed (44 out of 96 assays were noninformative). Thus, the two studies are in agreement that the frequency of LOH for NER genes is low in colorectal cancer.
In conclusion, association and LOH studies suggest that NER genes are not important genetic determinants for colorectal carcinogenesis. A modest association between colorectal cancer and a polymorphism in the recombination repair gene XRCC3 was found, but additional studies will be required to evaluate its importance.
