To evaluate their prognostic value, the expressions of CD44v and sialyl LeX (SLX) in colorectal cancers were studied immunohistochemically. Tissue specimens were reacted with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) CD44-1V and CSLEX-1. Of the 145 colorectal cancer patients undergoing curative resection, 59 (40.7%) were positive for mAb CD44-1V, and 40 (27.6%) were positive for mAb CSLEX-1. There was a significant correlation between the combined expression of SLX and CD44v8-10 and lymph node metastasis. The patients with tumors negative for CD44v8-10 and SLX had the most favorable prognoses. Conversely, the patients with tumors positive for both CD44v8-10 and SLX had a high recurrence rate and the poorest prognoses. In a multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model, the combined expression of SLX and CD44v8-10 emerged as an independent prognostic indicator. These results suggested that the combined expression of CD44v8-10 and SLX may be a biologic marker of prognostic significance.
