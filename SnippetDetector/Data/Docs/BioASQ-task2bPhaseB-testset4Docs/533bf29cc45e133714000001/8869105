In animal models, isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) containing sequences encoded by one or several of ten different exons (v1-v10) contribute to tumour metastasis. In certain human cancers, CD44v6 expression is associated with poor prognosis. This paper examines CD44v expression in skin carcinogenesis and skin cancer metastasis. CD44v expression was studied in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), primary malignant melanoma (PMM), metastases of MM (MMM), benign melanocytic naevi (BMN) and normal skin (NS) by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). BCC, SCC and NS expressed several CD44v, including v6, albeit in different distributions and intensities. PMM, MMM and BMN expressed isoforms containing v7/8 and v10, but failed to express epitopes encoded by v5 or v6. Thus, different CD44 isoforms are found in human skin cancers and are modulated during carcinogenesis. However, we did not observe a correlation of CD44v6 expression with metastatic potential.
