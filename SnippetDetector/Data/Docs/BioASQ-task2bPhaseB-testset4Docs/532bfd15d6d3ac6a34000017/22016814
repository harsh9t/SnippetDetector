Death receptor-induced programmed necrosis is regarded as a secondary death mechanism dominating only in cells that cannot properly induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. Here, we show that in cells lacking TGFβ-activated Kinase-1 (TAK1) expression, catalytically active Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (RIP1)-dependent programmed necrosis overrides apoptotic processes following Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα) stimulation and results in rapid cell death. Importantly, the activation of the caspase cascade and caspase-8-mediated RIP1 cleavage in TNFα-stimulated TAK1 deficient cells is not sufficient to prevent RIP1-dependent necrosome formation and subsequent programmed necrosis. Our results demonstrate that TAK1 acts independently of its kinase activity to prevent the premature dissociation of ubiquitinated-RIP1 from TNFα-stimulated TNF-receptor I and also to inhibit the formation of TNFα-induced necrosome complex consisting of RIP1, RIP3, FADD, caspase-8 and cFLIP(L). The surprising prevalence of catalytically active RIP1-dependent programmed necrosis over apoptosis despite ongoing caspase activity implicates a complex regulatory mechanism governing the decision between both cell death pathways following death receptor stimulation.

Introduction
± is a pleiotropic cytokine regulating a variety of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. y binding to  receptor  (-), a death receptor superfamily member, ± induces the formation of the plasma membrane-associated complex-, including , 2/5, c. IAP1/2 and RIP1. Within complex-I, RIP1 is ubiquitinated depending on TRAF2/5 and cIAP1/2 and polybuiquitinated RIP1 (Ubi-RIP1) recruits TAK1 (TAK1/TAB2/TAB3) and IKK (IKKΞ±/IKKΞ²/NEMO) kinase complexes. Then, auto-activated TAK1 phosphorylates and activates IKKΞ², facilitating IKKΞ²-mediated IΞΊBΞ± degradation and downstream NF-ΞΊB activation [1], [2].
Ligation of TNF-RI by TNFΞ± also leads to the assembly of a second, cytoplasmic multiprotein complex. Deubiquitination of RIP1 is prerequisite for the formation of complex-II comprising RIP1, RIP3, FADD and caspase-8, which is then activated by auto-cleavage and initiates apoptosis. Caspase-8 also cleaves RIP1 and inactivates it within complex-II [1], [3]. TNFΞ±-induced apoptosis is mainly studied in the absence of de novo protein synthesis or in cells lacking crucial activators of the NF-ΞΊB pathway, since cells that can trigger TNFΞ±-dependent NF-ΞΊB activation express multiple anti-apoptotic genes and block complex-II-mediated apoptosis initiation [4], [5], [6], [7].
TNFΞ±-induced programmed necrosis, or necroptosis, is a recently defined alternative cell death pathway absolutely requiring RIP1 kinase activity and is described to dominate only when dying cells cannot activate caspase-8 [1], [3]. Under these conditions, TNFΞ±-induced complex-II acts as the pre-necrotic β€�necrosomeβ€™ complex, where catalytically active RIP1 and RIP3 trigger rapid reactive-oxygen-species (ROS) accumulation and subsequent cell death with morphological features reminiscent of necrosis [1], [3], [8], [9], [10]. The catalytic activity of RIP1 is required for the formation of the necrosome complex [8]. Since RIP1 is inactivated by caspase-8, prevention of RIP1 cleavage by caspase inhibition is thought to be required for efficient death receptor-mediated necrosis induction.
Recent studies indicated a role for cFLIPL, the catalytically inactive homologue of caspase-8, in programmed necrosis inhibition [11], [12]. Hetero-dimerisation of caspase-8 and cFLIPL was shown to be necessary for caspase-8 mediated protection from necrosis [12]. However, depending on its expression level, cFLIPL may inhibit or augment caspase-8 activity [13], hence its mechanistic contribution in necrosis is not completely clear.
As TAK1 is a critical component of TNFΞ±-induced NF-ΞΊB activation, cells lacking TAK1 expression undergo cell death following TNFΞ± stimulation [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, TAK1 knock-out (KO) cells are remarkably more sensitive to TNFΞ±-induced cytotoxicity than other types of cells that cannot activate NF-ΞΊB [18], [19]. In addition, TAK1 KO mice die at an earlier embryonic stage than mice lacking IKKΞ² or NEMO expression [4], [5], [19], [20]. This shows that TAK1 has additional, NF-ΞΊB-independent functions during embryonic development. It has been reported that TNFΞ± stimulation of TAK1 KO keratinocytes led to a ROS-mediated, rapid cell death [18]. Moreover, it has recently been shown that in L929 cells, a murine fibrosarcoma cell line that undergoes caspase-independent programmed necrosis upon TNFΞ± stimulation and is commonly used as a model system for this type of cell death, down-regulation of TAK1 augmented the ongoing necrotic response [21]. Here, we dissect the molecular mechanism of TNFΞ±-induced death of TAK1 deficient cells and show that ablation of TAK1 expression alone is sufficient for the induction of TNFΞ±-mediated programmed necrosis in cells that are otherwise resistant to TNFΞ±-induced cytotoxicity. We identified RIP1 as a critical mediator of TNFΞ±-induced ROS accumulation and cell death in the absence of TAK1, indicating the induction of the necrotic pathway. TAK1 mediated the stabilization of polyubiquitinated RIP1 in complex-I and prohibited RIP1-dependent rapid necrosis, unravelling a novel functional connection between these two kinases in addition to their established cooperation in TNFΞ±-induced NF-ΞΊB signalling. Moreover, our results demonstrated that RIP1 kinase activity-dependent cell death proceeds even in the presence of ongoing caspase activity.

Results and iscussion
1 hinders ±-induced, 1-mediated rapid cell death. To evaluate whether RIP1 plays a role in the death of TAK1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), cells were transfected with two different RIP1-targeting siRNA constructs along with a control siRNA. Loss of RIP1 completely prevented TNFΞ±-induced cell death after 2.5 hours of stimulation and provided major protection after 6 hours (Fig. 1A). In addition, TNFΞ±-induced ROS accumulation in TAK1 KO MEFs could be fully prevented by RIP1 down-regulation (Fig. 1B). A specific RIP1 kinase- and programmed necrosis-inhibitor, Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) [22], [23], and the ROS scavenger butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) also completely blocked TNFΞ±-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 1C) [18]. Moreover, Nec-1 was as effective as BHA in blocking TNFΞ±-induced ROS accumulation in the absence of TAK1 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these experiments show that catalytically active RIP1 is essential for TNFΞ±-dependent, ROS-mediated rapid cell death in the absence of TAK1, indicating the triggering of the necrotic pathway.10.1371/journal.pone.0026069.g001Figure 1TAK1 impairs ROS-mediated cell death triggered by catalytically active RIP1.(A) Left panel TAK1 KO MEFs transfected with a control siRNA (siC) or with RIP1 targeting siRNAs were stimulated with TNFΞ± and cell survival was analyzed by crystal violet staining (CV). The bar graphs depict mean values Β± SEM %. Right panel Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting (WB) with Ξ±-RIP1 and Ξ±-NEMO antibodies to control the efficiency of RIP1 down-regulation. (B) TAK1 KO MEFs were transfected as in (A) and stimulated with TNFΞ±. Intracellular ROS accumulation was analyzed by flow cytometry. (C) TAK1 KO MEFs were treated with DMSO or Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) for 1 hour and then stimulated with TNFΞ±. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was added together with TNFΞ±. Cell survival was analyzed by CV. The bar graphs depict mean values Β± SEM %. (D) TAK1 KO MEFs were treated with DMSO, Nec-1 or BHA as in (C) and stimulated with TNFΞ± for indicated time points. ROS accumulation was analyzed as in (B).Necrosis overrules apoptosis in TNFΞ±-treated TAK1 deficient cellsDeath receptor-mediated programmed necrosis has been defined to predominate in the absence of caspase activity [1], [3]. However, TNFΞ± stimulation induced the cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3 and the caspase-8 target, RIP1 in TAK1 KO MEFs (Fig. 2A), similar to previous observations made in keratinocytes [18]. Treatment of TAK1 KO MEFs with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK completely abrogated caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2B) as well as the cleavage of RIP1 and the caspase-3 target, PARP1 (Fig. S1A), nevertheless provided only minor protection from TNFΞ±-dependent death (Fig. 2C). Moreover, zVAD failed to block TNFΞ±-induced ROS accumulation in TAK1 KO cells (Fig. 2D). Similar observations were obtained by using another broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-OPh (Fig. S1). These results indicate that TNFΞ±-dependent caspase activation plays only a marginal role in the death of TAK1 KO cells. Of note, Nec-1 and BHA treatment attenuated caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleavage following stimulation, indicating that TNFΞ±-induced ROS accumulation augmented caspase activation (Fig. 2E) [18]. Nec-1 and BHA provided full protection from TNFΞ±-mediated rapid cell death without a complete block on caspase activation (Figure 1C and 2E), further supporting the conclusion that ROS-mediated necrosis is the primary cause of the rapid demise of TNFΞ±-stimulated TAK1 KO cells, giving no time to caspase-dependent apoptotic processes to mediate cell death.10.1371/journal.pone.0026069.g002Figure 2TNFΞ±-induced caspase activity in TAK1 deficient cells is not essential for ROS-mediated cytotoxicity.(A) TAK1 KO and WT MEFs were stimulated with TNFΞ± as indicated and analyzed by WB with the indicated antibodies to detect IΞΊBΞ± degradation and the cleavage of RIP1, caspase-8 (p18) and caspase-3 (p15).

(E) TAK1 KO MEFs were pre-treated with DMSO or Nec-1 for 1 hour, stimulated with TNFΞ± and analyzed as in (B). BHA was added together with TNFΞ±. (*) denotes the cleaved fragments of caspase-3 (p15) and RIP1.TAK1 blocks TNFΞ±-dependent necrosome formationTNFΞ±-mediated necrotic cell death requires the formation of the necrosome complex, including RIP1, RIP3, FADD and caspase-8, whose catalytic activity has to be blocked by either small-molecule inhibitors or virally expressed anti-apoptotic proteins [1], [3]. Using FADD immunoprecipitation, we investigated whether TNFΞ± could induce necrosome formation in the absence of TAK1. As expected, WT MEFs required co-administration of zVAD together with TNFΞ± and CHX for efficient necrosome formation (Fig. S2). On the other hand, in TAK1 KO cells, all known components of the necrosome complex immunoprecipitated with FADD within 30-45 minutes of TNFΞ± stimulation (Fig. 3A). Necrosome formation was fully inhibited by Nec-1 treatment, implicating an absolute dependence on catalytically active RIP1 (Fig. 3B). Thus, our study presents TAK1 as a key mediator of TNFΞ± signalling that specifically blocks RIP1 kinase activity-dependent necrosome formation.10.1371/journal.pone.0026069.g003Figure 3TAK1 prevents TNFΞ±-induced necrosome formation and stabilizes polyubiquitinated RIP1 in complex-I.(A) TAK1 KO MEFs were stimulated with TNFΞ± and lysed for immunoprecipitation with an Ξ±-FADD antibody to isolate the necrosome complex. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by WB with the indicated antibodies. (B) TAK1 KO MEFs were pre-treated with DMSO, Nec-1 or zVAD for 60 minutes and then stimulated with TNFΞ±. Cell lysates were analyzed by WB as in (A). (C) WT and TAK1 KO MEFs were stimulated with Flag-TNFΞ± for indicated time points. TNFΞ±-bound TNF-RI and additional complex-I members were immunoprecipitated by Ξ±-Flag M2 affinity beads and analyzed by WB. Ubi-RIP1 depicts complex-I-associated polyubiquitinated RIP1. (*) denotes the p43 fragment of caspase-8 and cFLIPL. n.s, non-specific band.Surprisingly, in both WT and TAK1 deficient MEFs, the necrosome complex contained cFLIPL (Fig. 3A, 3B and Fig. S2). Given its dual nature on the modulation of caspase-8 activation [13], further analysis of cFLIPL within the necrosome complex may shed light on the dynamics of necrosome formation and function.It is of note that at later time points, predominantly the cleaved forms of caspase-8 and cFLIPL (43 kDa) were found in the necrosome complex, although the p43 fragment of caspase-8 was poorly identifiable in input samples (Fig. 3A and 3B). This indicated that caspase-8 in the necrosome was catalytically active and processed itself as well as cFLIPL. Accordingly, treatment of TAK1 KO MEFs with TNFΞ± and zVAD enhanced the incorporation of full length caspase-8, cFLIPL and RIP1 (Fig. 3B). Whether this translates into an enhanced activation of the necrosome complex is an open question, nevertheless, these experiments show that RIP1 kinase activity-dependent necrosome formation can occur in the presence of ongoing caspase activity. Also, caspase-8-mediated cleavage and the assumed inactivation of RIP1 (Fig. 2A) [1], [3] does not block programmed necrosis initiation following TNFΞ± stimulation.TAK1 stabilizes Ubi-RIP1 association with complex-IIn order to analyze whether TAK1 curbs the cytotoxic potential of RIP1 by regulating its incorporation into TNFΞ±-induced complex-I, WT and TAK1 KO MEFs were stimulated with Flag-TNFΞ± and complex-I was immunoprecipitated with an Ξ±-Flag antibody. Stimulus-dependent incorporation of Ubi-RIP1 [7], [24] into complex-I was evident in both cell types, yet in TAK1 KO cells, the amount of Ubi-RIP1 decreased significantly at later time points compared to WT cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that TAK1 stabilizes Ubi-RIP1 in complex-I. In TNFΞ±-treated TAK1 KO cells, the accelerated dissociation of RIP1 from complex-I was accompanied by RIP1-dependent necrosome formation within 30 minutes of stimulation. Hence, TAK1-mediated protection of cells from TNFΞ±-induced rapid cytotoxicity might proceed via regulation of ubiquitinated-RIP1 incorporation into complex-I. In a similar manner, it has been shown that treatment of cells with Smac mimetic to diminish cIAP1/2 expression and Ubi-RIP1 association with complex-I also resulted in RIP1 kinase-activity-dependent caspase activation and subsequent cell death following TNFΞ± stimulation [7].TAK1 has a kinase-independent cytoprotective functionIn order to ensure that the sensitivity of TAK1 KO MEFs to TNFΞ±-induced cytotoxicity was only due to the lack of TAK1 expression, cells were stably transfected with wild type TAK1. TAK1 KO MEFs were also reconstituted with a catalytically inactive mutant of TAK1 (TAK1-K63W [25]) to investigate whether TAK1 kinase activity was required for the protection from necrosis. By using a TAK1 kinase inhibitor (NP-009245) at 1 ΒµM, it has been suggested that inhibition of TAK1 catalytic activity further increased caspase-independent necrosis in L929 cells [21]. However, at this concentration, NP-009245 inhibited EGF and PMA-mediated JNK phosphorylation in WT and TAK1 KO MEFs equally well, indicating that NP-009245 did not enhance TNFΞ±-mediated necrosis specifically via TAK1 inhibition (Fig. S3).As expected, TAK1 KO cells reconstituted with TAK1-WT were capable of TNFΞ±-induced IΞΊBΞ± degradation, which was impaired in cells expressing TAK1-K63W (Fig. 4A). Nevertheless, reconstitution of TAK1 KO cells with either construct resulted in a prolonged association of Ubi-RIP1 with TNFΞ±-induced complex-I compared to empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). This suggested a scaffold function for TAK1 to restrict the premature dissociation of RIP1 from complex-I. In parallel with this observation, TNFΞ±-dependent necrosome formation was inhibited upon reconstitution with either TAK1-WT or TAK1-K63W (Fig. 4C). Moreover, expression of TAK1-WT or TAK1-K63W in TAK1 KO cells provided complete protection from TNFΞ±-dependent cytotoxicity (Fig. 4D) and also blocked TNFΞ±-induced caspase activation (Fig. 4E) as well as ROS accumulation (Fig. 4F). These data demonstrate that TAK1 acts as an adaptor molecule in complex-I to prevent premature dissociation of Ubi-RIP1 and also functions independently of its kinase activity to block TNFΞ±-induced, RIP1-mediated necrosis. Therefore, our data suggest that TAK1 may suppress the pro-necrotic activity of RIP1 by sequestering it within complex-I, highlighting a novel non-catalytic function of TAK1 in complex-I in addition to its role as a signal transducer for TNFΞ±-mediated NF-ΞΊB activation.10.1371/journal.pone.0026069.g004Figure 4TAK1 blocks TNFΞ±-induced necrosis independently of its kinase activity.(A) TAK1 KO MEFs transfected with a WT or a kinase-dead mutant (K63W) construct of TAK1 along with untransfected and empty-vector (EV) transfected cells were stimulated with TNFΞ± and analyzed by WB for IΞΊBΞ± degradation as well as TAK1 and NEMO expression. (B) Cells were stimulated with Flag-TNFΞ± and Ubi-RIP1 interaction with complex-I was analyzed by immunoprecipitating Flag-TNFΞ±-bound TNF-RI and associated factors by Ξ±-Flag M2 affinity beads as in Fig. 3C. (C) Indicated cells were stimulated with TNFΞ± and necrosome formation was investigated by immunoprecipitating FADD as in Fig. 3A and 3B. (D) Cells were stimulated with TNFΞ± and cell survival was analyzed by CV. The bar graphs depict mean values Β± SEM %. (E) Cells were stimulated with TNFΞ± and caspase activation was assessed by WB analysis. (F) Cells were treated with TNFΞ± and intracellular ROS accumulation was analyzed by flow cytometry. (*) denotes the p43 fragment of caspase-8 and cFLIPL. (#) denotes cleaved caspase-3 (p15). n.s., non-specific band.RIP1-dependent necrotic cell death is not only observed following death receptor stimulation, but also in acute pancreatitis [9], [10], ischemia-induced brain injury [23] as well as myocardial infarction [26]. Hence, future studies may reveal whether TAK1 also modulates RIP1-dependent necrosis under these pathophysiological conditions and help further characterization of TAK1-RIP1 interplay in necrotic cell death.
