UNLABELLED: Radioresistance is a frustrating obstacle for patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs) undergoing radiotherapy. There is an urgent need to find an effective agent to increase the sensitivity of CRCs to radiation. Honokiol, an active compound purified from Magnolia, was found to radiosensitize colorectal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanisms control important signaling that enhances radiosensitivity is currently unknown. In this study, we have reviewed important signaling pathways that are closely related to radiosensitization, such as cell cycle arrest, tumor angiogenesis, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and Mismatch repair. Studies show that honokiol can interfere with these pathways at different levels. With overall analysis, it may bring light on finding the possible mechanism by which honokiol acts as a radiosensitizing agent for CRCs.
