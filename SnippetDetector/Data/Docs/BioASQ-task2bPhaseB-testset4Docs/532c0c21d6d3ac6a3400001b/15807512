Generation of reliable pharmacophore models is a key strategy in drug design. The quality of a pharmacophore model is known to depend on several factors, with the quality of the conformer sets used perhaps being one of the most important. The goal of this study was to compare different conformational analysis methods to determine if one was superior to the others for pharmacophore generation using Catalyst/HypoGen. The five methods selected were Catalyst/Fast, Catalyst/Best, Omega, Chem-X and MacroModel. Data sets for which Catalysts models had previously been published were selected using defined quality measures. Hypotheses were generated for each of the data sets and the performance of the different conformational analysis methods was compared using both quantitative (cost and correlation coefficients) and qualitative measures (by comparing the hypotheses in terms of the features present and their spatial relationships). Two main conclusions emerged from the study. First, it was not always possible to replicate the literature results. The reasons for these failures are explored in detail, and a template for use in publications that apply the Catalyst methodology is proposed. Second, the faster rule-based methods for conformational analysis give pharmacophore models that are just as good as, and in some cases better than, the models generated using the slower, more rigorous approaches.
