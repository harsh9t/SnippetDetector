Whereas computational methods for molecular design are well established in medicinal chemistry research, their application in the field of natural products is still not exhaustively explored. This article gives a short introduction into both the potential for the application of computer-assisted approaches, such as pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, docking, and neural networking to efficiently access the bioactive metabolites, and the requirements and limitations related to this specific field. The challenge is which selection criteria and/or multiple filtering tools to apply for a target-oriented isolation of potentially bioactive secondary metabolites. Application examples are provided where in silico tools and classical methods used by natural product scientists are used in an effort to maximize their efficacy in drug discovery. Thus, integrated computer-assisted strategies may help to process the huge amount of available structural and biological information in a reasonably short time for a straightforward search of bioactive natural products.
