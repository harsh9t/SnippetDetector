The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) binds Hsp90 and/or Hsp70 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), facilitating ubiquitination of the chaperone-bound client proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the activity of CHIP are, at present, poorly understood. We previously reported that Ca(2+)/S100 proteins directly associate with the TPR proteins, such as Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop), kinesin light chain, Tom70, FKBP52, CyP40, and protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), leading to the dissociation of the interactions of the TPR proteins with their target proteins. Therefore, we have hypothesized that Ca(2+)/S100 proteins can interact with CHIP and regulate its function. GST pulldown assays indicated that Ca(2+)/S100A2 and S100P bind to the TPR domain and lead to interference with the interactions of CHIP with Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. In vitro ubiquitination assays indicated that Ca(2+)/S100A2 and S100P are efficient and specific inhibitors of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. Overexpression of S100A2 and S100P suppressed CHIP-chaperone complex-dependent mutant p53 ubiquitination and degradation in Hep3B cells. The association of the S100 proteins with CHIP provides a Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory mechanism for the ubiquitination and degradation of intracellular proteins by the CHIP-proteasome pathway.
