The development of new anticancer agents derived from natural resources requires a rapid identification of their molecular mechanism of action. To make this step short, we have initiated the proteomic profiling of HeLa cells treated with anticancer drugs representing a wide spectrum of mechanisms of action using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Unique proteome patterns were observed in HeLa cells treated with the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, and were similar to the patterns induced by radicicol, a structurally different HSP90 inhibitor. On the other hand, etoposide and ICRF-193, compounds claimed to be topoisomerase II inhibitors, showed different proteomic profiles, which reflect their different biological activities as revealed by cell-cycle analysis. Thus far, combined data from 19 compounds have allowed their successful classification by cluster analysis according to the mechanism of action.
