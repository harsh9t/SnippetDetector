Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an abundant molecular chaperone in the eukaryotic cytosol, is involved in the folding of a set of cell regulatory proteins and in the re-folding of stress-denatured polypeptides. The basic mechanism of action of Hsp90 is not yet understood. In particular, it has been debated whether Hsp90 function is ATP dependent. A recent crystal structure of the NH2-terminal domain of yeast Hsp90 established the presence of a conserved nucleotide binding site that is identical with the binding site of geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90. The functional significance of nucleotide binding by Hsp90 has remained unclear. Here we present evidence for a slow but clearly detectable ATPase activity in purified Hsp90. Based on a new crystal structure of the NH2-terminal domain of human Hsp90 with bound ADP-Mg and on the structural homology of this domain with the ATPase domain of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase, the residues of Hsp90 critical in ATP binding (D93) and ATP hydrolysis (E47) were identified. The corresponding mutations were made in the yeast Hsp90 homologue, Hsp82, and tested for their ability to functionally replace wild-type Hsp82. Our results show that both ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for Hsp82 function in vivo. The mutant Hsp90 proteins tested are defective in the binding and ATP hydrolysis-dependent cycling of the co-chaperone p23, which is thought to regulate the binding and release of substrate polypeptide from Hsp90. Remarkably, the complete Hsp90 protein is required for ATPase activity and for the interaction with p23, suggesting an intricate allosteric communication between the domains of the Hsp90 dimer. Our results establish Hsp90 as an ATP-dependent chaperone.

Many newly synthesized polypeptides depend on  the assistance of molecular chaperones for their  efficient folding. he mechanisms in assisted  protein folding of two main classes of molecular chaperones, the sp70s and the chaperonins, have been well  characterized (ething and ambrook, 1992; raig, 1993;  artl, 1996; ohnson and raig, 1997). n contrast, much  less is known about the biochemical mechanism of the  heat shock protein 90 (sp90)1 family, another class of  abundant chaperones and constitutively expressed stress  proteins whose members have been highly conserved from  prokaryotes to eukaryotes (indquist and raig, 1988;  uchner, 1996). he first partial crystal structures of sp90  have been published only recently (rodromou et al.,  1997a,b; tebbins et al., 1997).Many newly synthesized polypeptides depend on  the assistance of molecular chaperones for their  efficient folding. The mechanisms in assisted  protein folding of two main classes of molecular chaperones, the Hsp70s and the chaperonins, have been well  characterized (Gething and Sambrook, 1992; Craig, 1993;  Hartl, 1996; Johnson and Craig, 1997). In contrast, much  less is known about the biochemical mechanism of the  heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)1 family, another class of  abundant chaperones and constitutively expressed stress  proteins whose members have been highly conserved from  prokaryotes to eukaryotes (Lindquist and Craig, 1988;  Buchner, 1996). The first partial crystal structures of Hsp90  have been published only recently (Prodromou et al.,  1997a,b; Stebbins et al., 1997).

The cellular function of sp90 extends beyond the general chaperone properties of this protein. sp90 is specifically involved in the folding and conformational regulation of a number of medically relevant signal transduction  molecules, including the nuclear receptors for steroid hormones and several protooncogenic kinases (mith, 1993;  athan and indquist, 1995; rydman and ¶hfeld, 1997;  athan et al., 1997; ratt and oft, 1997). nhibition of  sp90 function by the ansamycin antibiotics (geldanamycin [], herbimycin , macbecin) causes the misfolding  and degradation of these substrates (hitesell et al., 1994;  mith et al., 1995; chneider et al., 1996; ittmar and  ratt, 1997). n addition, sp90 participates in the renaturation of some proteins that have unfolded under conditions of cellular stress (chneider et al., 1996; athan et al.,  1997). lthough purified sp90 can prevent the aggregation of unfolded proteins and in a minimal system in vitro  cooperates with sp70/sp40 in the -dependent refolding of model proteins (iech et al., 1992; akob et al.,  1995; reeman and orimoto, 1996; chumacher et al.,  1996; oung et al., 1997; cheibel et al., 1998), it is likely  that sp90 fulfills most of its cellular roles in close cooperation with a host of cofactors and cochaperones, including op (p60/ti1p), the immunophilins 52 and  51/54, cyclophilin 40 (yp40), cdc37 (p50), and p23,  as well as sp70 and its cofactors sp40, ip (p48), and  ag1 (ap46) (air et al., 1996; rydman and ¶hfeld,  1997; ratt and oft, 1997; ¶hfeld, 1998). odels for the  ordered, yet dynamic interaction of sp90 with these cofactors during the folding of steroid receptors have been  proposed on the basis of experiments in crude cytosol  extracts and partially purified systems (for reviews see  mith, 1993; ratt and oft, 1997). t is generally thought  that an unfolded polypeptide substrate associates first with  the sp70 system (β€�early complexβ€�) (mith, 1993) and is  then targeted to sp90 via op, a tetratricopeptide repeat  () protein that interacts with both sp70 and sp90  (hen et al., 1996; ittmar et al., 1996; ittmar and ratt,  1997; ohnson et al., 1998). his interaction gives rise to  the formation of an β€�intermediate complex,β€� containing  ip, op, and sp70 in addition to sp90. urther remodelling results in the β€�mature complex,β€� consisting of  sp90, p23, an immunophilin, or yp40. he steroid receptor in this complex is largely folded and competent to  bind hormone with high affinity. he acquisition of this  high affinity conformation is dependent on the interaction  of sp90 with the acidic protein p23. eldanamycin ()  prevents p23 binding to sp90 and inhibits the proper  folding of steroid receptor (ohnson et al., 1994; ohnson  and oft, 1995; mith et al., 1995; renert et al., 1997; ullivan et al., 1997).The cellular function of Hsp90 extends beyond the general chaperone properties of this protein. Hsp90 is specifically involved in the folding and conformational regulation of a number of medically relevant signal transduction  molecules, including the nuclear receptors for steroid hormones and several protooncogenic kinases (Smith, 1993;  Nathan and Lindquist, 1995; Frydman and HΓ¶hfeld, 1997;  Nathan et al., 1997; Pratt and Toft, 1997). Inhibition of  Hsp90 function by the ansamycin antibiotics (geldanamycin [GA], herbimycin A, macbecin) causes the misfolding  and degradation of these substrates (Whitesell et al., 1994;  Smith et al., 1995; Schneider et al., 1996; Dittmar and  Pratt, 1997). In addition, Hsp90 participates in the renaturation of some proteins that have unfolded under conditions of cellular stress (Schneider et al., 1996; Nathan et al.,  1997). Although purified Hsp90 can prevent the aggregation of unfolded proteins and in a minimal system in vitro  cooperates with Hsp70/Hsp40 in the ATP-dependent refolding of model proteins (Wiech et al., 1992; Jakob et al.,  1995; Freeman and Morimoto, 1996; Schumacher et al.,  1996; Young et al., 1997; Scheibel et al., 1998), it is likely  that Hsp90 fulfills most of its cellular roles in close cooperation with a host of cofactors and cochaperones, including Hop (p60/Sti1p), the immunophilins FKBP52 and  FKBP51/54, cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), cdc37 (p50), and p23,  as well as Hsp70 and its cofactors Hsp40, Hip (p48), and  Bag1 (Rap46) (Nair et al., 1996; Frydman and HΓ¶hfeld,  1997; Pratt and Toft, 1997; HΓ¶hfeld, 1998). Models for the  ordered, yet dynamic interaction of Hsp90 with these cofactors during the folding of steroid receptors have been  proposed on the basis of experiments in crude cytosol  extracts and partially purified systems (for reviews see  Smith, 1993; Pratt and Toft, 1997). It is generally thought  that an unfolded polypeptide substrate associates first with  the Hsp70 system (β€�early complexβ€�) (Smith, 1993) and is  then targeted to Hsp90 via Hop, a tetratricopeptide repeat  (TPR) protein that interacts with both Hsp70 and Hsp90  (Chen et al., 1996; Dittmar et al., 1996; Dittmar and Pratt,  1997; Johnson et al., 1998). This interaction gives rise to  the formation of an β€�intermediate complex,β€� containing  Hip, Hop, and Hsp70 in addition to Hsp90. Further remodelling results in the β€�mature complex,β€� consisting of  Hsp90, p23, an immunophilin, or Cyp40. The steroid receptor in this complex is largely folded and competent to  bind hormone with high affinity. The acquisition of this  high affinity conformation is dependent on the interaction  of Hsp90 with the acidic protein p23. Geldanamycin (GA)  prevents p23 binding to Hsp90 and inhibits the proper  folding of steroid receptor (Johnson et al., 1994; Johnson  and Toft, 1995; Smith et al., 1995; Grenert et al., 1997; Sullivan et al., 1997).

The mature sp90 multi-chaperone complex dissociates  with a t1/2 of β�5 min and unliganded steroid receptor re-enters the reaction cycle at the level of the early sp70  complex (mith, 1998). hese dynamic interactions are   dependent and thought to be driven by the sp70  ase. hether sp90 itself binds and hydrolyzes   has been one of the most controversial issues in the chaperone literature (sermely and ahn, 1991; iech et al.,  1992; sermely et al., 1993; ohnson and oft, 1994, 1995;  akob et al., 1996; renert et al., 1997; cheibel et al.,  1997, 1998). he recent crystal structures of the 2-terminal 25-k. D domain of human and yeast Hsp90 revealed  that this domain binds not only the ansamycin antibiotic  GA but also, in the same site, adenine nucleotide, thus  suggesting that GA acts by inhibiting an ATP-dependent  function of Hsp90 (Prodromou et al., 1997a; Stebbins et al.,  1997). Interestingly, the NH2-terminal domain functions  also in binding unfolded polypeptide (Young et al., 1997;  Scheibel et al., 1998), either independently or in conjunction with the COOH-terminal 12-kD domain, which mediates Hsp90 dimerization and the binding of the TPR proteins Hop, FKBP52, FKBP51/54, and Cyp40 (Young et al.,  1998). The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains are connected by a β�Ό35-kD segment of unknown function.

Materials and ethods
rystallization and -ay nalysis. The NH2-terminal domain of human Hsp90 (residues 9β€“236) was expressed and purified as described (Stebbins et al., 1997). Crystals were  grown in the presence of 10 mM adenosine-5β€²-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)  (ATPΞ³S) and 0.2 M magnesium chloride, from a buffer of 0.1 M Tris-HCl,  pH 8.5, and 30% PEG4000. Data collection, structure determination, and  refinement followed the procedures described for the analysis of the same  domain with bound geldanamycin (Stebbins et al., 1997).Cloning Procedures and Site-directed MutagenesisHuman Hsp90Ξ± cDNA in pUC19 (Aligue et al., 1994) and yeast Hsp82 in  pTGPD/P82 were used as templates for PCR amplification. The coding region for the yeast homologue of p23 (YKL117W) (Bohen, 1998; Fang et al.,  1998) was amplified by PCR from wild-type yeast genomic DNA. In the  case of Hsp82, PCR products were subcloned into derivatives of the  pET23a Vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), to generate the recombinant protein fragments containing either a COOH-terminal His6 sequence  followed by an EEF immunotag or an NH2-terminal T7 tag. The cDNAs  encoding human Hsp90 and Hsp90 mutants, as well as human p23 were  cloned into the pAS2-1 vector for the analysis of the Hsp90-p23 interaction in two-hybrid assays (Bartel et al., 1993).Point mutations in human Hsp90 (E47A, E47D, and D93N) and yeast  Hsp82 (E33A, E33D, and D79N) were generated by PCR amplification  with mismatch oligonucleotides resulting in site-directed exchanges of  codons (Ausubel et al., 1987). The desired exchanges were confirmed by  DNA sequencing. Amplified HSP82 cDNA fragments were subcloned  into the vector pTGPD/P82 for expression in yeast or into pET23a derivatives for expression in Escherichia coli.Expression of Hsp82 Mutants in YeastThe yeast strain Ξ”PCLDa/Ξ± (Nathan and Lindquist, 1995), used throughout these experiments, is homozygous for deletion mutations in both  HSP90 genes (HSP82 and HSC82). It is rescued from lethality by the  URA3-containing plasmid pKAT6, which expresses wild-type Hsc82. This  strain was transformed with wild-type and point-mutated Hsp82 in the  expression vector pTGPD/P82 containing the TRP1-marker (Nathan  and Lindquist, 1995). Cotransformants were selected on SD/β�’Trp/β�’Ura  plates at 30Β°C.To determine the expression levels of Hsp82 constructs, cells were  grown in SD/β�’Trp/β�’Ura medium to mid-log phase. Extracts were prepared by agitation of cells with glass beads in ice-cold buffer A (50 mM  potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mM KCl, 15 mM imidazole, 5 mM  2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). After  centrifugation, Hsp82 proteins were concentrated by incubation of the  supernatants with Ni-NTA. The resin was washed with buffer A and subsequently with buffer B (same as buffer A, but pH 6.0). Finally, the recombinant proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazole in buffer B and  analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-EEFβ€“specific  antibody YL1/2 (Wehland et al., 1984).To examine the ability of Hsp82 point mutants to support cell viability,  wild-type Hsc82 on the URA3-containing pKAT6 plasmid was replaced  by a HSP82 mutant gene on the TRP1-containing expression vector pTGPD/P82 (Sikorski and Boeke, 1991). Cotransformants from the SD/ β�’Trp/β�’Ura plates were replica plated on 5-FOA (5-fluororotic acid)  plates (Sikorski and Boeke, 1991) at 25Β°C to select for cells that had lost  the original pKAT6 plasmid. After a second round of 5-FOA selection,  loss of the URA3-contaning plasmid pKAT6 was verified by the inability  of these cells to grow on SD/β�’Ura plates.Interaction of Hsp90 and p23 In VivoThe cDNAs encoding human full-length Hsp90 and mutant derivatives  were inserted in frame into the pAS2-1 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) containing TRP1 as a marker. The different constructs were used as a β€�baitβ€� in a two-hybrid assay and were cotransformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain Y190) together with human  p23 in the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) carrying a  LEU2 marker. Cotransformants were plated on SD/β�’Trp/β�’Leu plates.  The interaction of the bait construct, or the empty pAS2-1 vector as a control, with the p23 protein was judged by the ability of cotransformants to  grow on SD/β�’Trp/β�’Leu/β�’His plus 25 mM 3-AT (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole)  selection plates.Purification of Recombinant Proteins from E. coliExpression constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) LysS  cells (Studier et al., 1990). Cells were grown at 18Β°C in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/l ampicillin and 34 mg/l chloramphenicol to OD600 =  1 and protein expression induced for 5 h with 0.25 mM IPTG. After harvesting, cell pellets were resuspended and sonicated in buffer A and  Ni-NTA chromatography was performed as described. Proteins were purified further by ion-exchange chromatography on MonoQ and by gel filtration on Superose 12 (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ).Yeast p23 carrying an NH2-terminal T7 immunotag but lacking a His6  tag was also expressed in E. coli and ammonium sulphate precipitated  from the soluble fraction. After dialysis against buffer Y (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2), the protein was  purified further by ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose Fast  Flow (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) in the same buffer and by gel filtration on  Superose 12 in buffer Y.ATP Binding AssayNi-NTA resin was preblocked with buffer Y containing 5 mM ATP and 2  mM MgCl2. After washing with buffer Y, purified NH2-terminal domains  of wild-type Hsp82 and the E33A and D79N mutants (35 ΞΌM each) were  bound to the matrix via their His6 tags by incubation for 15 min at 25Β°C in  buffer Y in the presence of 35 ΞΌM [Ξ±32P]ATP (4 ΞΌCi/mM, Amersham Life  Science, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL). The beads were washed twice with  0.5 ml of buffer Y, protein was eluted with 500 mM imidazole in buffer Y,  and then bound radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Specifity of nucleotide binding was demonstrated by competition  with GA.ATPase AssayRecombinant full-length Hsp82 wild-type and mutant proteins (10 ΞΌM)  were incubated at 30Β°C in 40 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2 with  0.01β€“0.5 mM [Ξ±32P]ATP (4 ΞΌCi/mM, Amersham Life Science, Inc.) for  β‰¤120 min in a final volume of 20 ΞΌl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mM EDTA and freezing in liquid nitrogen. Separation of ADP  from ATP was achieved by thin layer chromatography on PEIβ€“cellulose  sheets (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 0.5 M LiCl and 0.5 M formic acid.  ATPase activity was monitored by quantitation of [Ξ±32P]ADP on a Fuji  PhosphorImager (model FLA-2000) using the MacBAS software package. For specific inhibition of the ATPase activity, GA was added to the  reaction at a final concentration of 180 ΞΌM in 1% DMSO. Conrol reactions received DMSO alone.Interaction of Hsp82 and p23 In VitroFull-length wild-type or mutant Hsp82 proteins (200 ΞΌg) were bound to  Ni-NTA resin in buffer Y supplemented with 1% (wt/vol) BSA and 25 mM  imidazole to minimize unspecific protein interactions. Yeast p23 protein  (100 ΞΌg) with an NH2-terminal T7 tag was added and the mixture was agitated at 30Β°C for 45 min in the prescence or absence of nucleotide and  GA. After three washes with buffer Y containing 25 mM imidazole,  Hsp82 protein was eluted from the resin with 500 mM imidazole in the  same buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotting with an  antibody against the T7 tag of recombinant yeast p23 (Novagen, Inc.).Miscellaneous ProceduresSDS-PAGE was as described (Laemmli et al., 1970). Immunolotting was  performed following the protocol of Towbin et al. (1979). Protein concentrations were determined by the BioRad protein assay (BIO RAD Laboratories GmbH, Munchen, Germany).

Results
rystal tructure of the 2-terminal omain of  uman sp90 omplexed with -g. We have previously reported the structure of the NH2-terminal domain of Hsp90 with bound GA (Stebbins et al.,  1997). Here we crystallized the NH2-terminal domain of  human Hsp90 (residues 9β€“236) in the presence of ATPΞ³S.  The crystals formed in spacegroup P21 with a = 53.2 β„«,  b = 44.1 β„«, c = 54.0 β„«, d = 115.7Β°. Difference fourier  maps showed clear density for ADP and one magnesium  ion consistent with full occupancy, but had no electron  density for a Ξ³-phosphate, either because the Ξ³-phosphate  was disordered or had been lost due to hydrolysis during  crystallization. The structure was refined to 1.5 β„« resolution with Rcryst/Rfree = 17.8/23.5%.As was observed with the structure of the NH2-terminal  domain of yeast Hsp90 (Prodromou et al., 1997a), ADP-Mg binds to a site in human Hsp90 where GA also binds  (Stebbins et al., 1997). The contacts between the nucleotide and Hsp90 in this complex are very similar to those  observed in the yeast complex (Prodromou et al., 1997a),  and involve both direct and water-mediated hydrogen  bonds (Fig. 1). The N6 group of the adenine purine forms  direct hydrogen bonds with the D93 side chain, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the S52 side chain and L48  backbone carbonyl groups. As in the case of the structure  with bound GA, the interaction with D93 (D79 in yeast  Hsp82) is probably most critical for stable nucleotide binding. The N7 group of the purine interacts via water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the N51 side chain, and the N1  group of the purine with the G97 backbone and D93 and  T81 side chain groups. Additional ADP-Mg contacts include a hydrogen bond between the O2β€² group and the  N106 side chain, a set of hydrogen bonds between the  Ξ±-phosphate group and the F138, G137 backbone amide  and N51 side chain groups. The Mg ion is octahedrally coordinated by the Ξ±- and Ξ²-phosphate groups of the ADP,  the N51 side chain of Hsp90, and three water molecules. The conformation of the binding site in the ADP-Mg  complex is essentially identical to the β€�openβ€� conformation of this site observed in the GAβ€“Hsp90 complex (Stebbins et al., 1997), except for the region spanning residues  106β€“124, which differs slightly (0.8β€“1.2 β„« displacements in  CΞ± positions). As was the case with GA binding, the closed  conformation, which has backbone displacements of as  much as 10 β„«, constricting the opening of the binding  pocket from 12 β„« to 8 β„« (Stebbins et al., 1997), would not  be compatible with ADP-Mg binding. This raises the possibility that the conformational change is part of a regulatory mechanism that may involve nucleotide binding and  turnover.Interestingly, there is a striking similarity in overall  tertiary structure between the NH2-terminal domain of  Hsp90 and the NH2-terminal ATP-binding domain of the  bacterial type II topoisomerase, DNA gyrase B of E. coli  (Wigley et al., 1991). This similarity extends to the conformation of the bound nucleotide and to most of the critical interactions between the nucleotide and the binding  pocket. Significantly, a conserved glutamate residue in the  gyrase protein, E42, which corresponds to E47 in the NH2-terminal domain of human Hsp90 (E33 in the yeast protein), was identified as the catalytic center for ATP hydrolysis in the gyrase (Jackson and Maxwell, 1993). As shown  in Fig. 1, E47 is indeed positioned such that it could play a  catalytic role in cleaving the Ξ³-phosphate bond of Hsp90-bound ATP, suggesting that Hsp90 binds and hydrolyzes  ATP in a manner similar to DNA gyrase.Mutations in the ATP Binding Site of Hsp90 Are  Incompatible with Cell GrowthTo test the possible functional significance of the conserved D93 and E47 residues of human Hsp90 for ATP  binding and hydrolysis, respectively, the effects of site-directed mutations in the corresponding residues D79 and  E33 of yeast Hsp82 (83% similarity and 70% identity with  the human sequence) were analyzed in vivo. Yeast contains two HSP90 genes, HSP82 and HSC82, whose combined deletion is lethal (Borkovich et al., 1989). We therefore used a yeast strain (Ξ”PCLDa/Ξ±) for this analysis that  is deleted in both chromosomal HSP90 genes but rescued  from lethality by constitutive expression of plasmid-encoded  wild-type Hsc82 protein (Nathan and Lindquist, 1995). We  first addressed the question whether mutations of D79 and  E33 affect the expression and gross stability of Hsp82. The  Ξ”PCLDa/Ξ± strain was cotransformed with an additional  HSP82 gene expressing either wild-type or mutant proteins  (from the same promoter) that could be distinguished  from the preexistent Hsc82 by the presence of COOH-terminal His6 and EEF tags (Wehland et al., 1984). Yeast  cells expressing either untagged wild-type Hsp82, wild-type  Hsp82-His6EEF, or Hsp82-His6EEF proteins containing  the mutations E33A, E33D, or D79N were grown to mid-log phase. Cell lysates were prepared, adjusted to equal  protein concentrations, and then Hsp82 proteins quantitatively adsorbed to Ni-NTA beads via their His6 tags (see  Materials and Methods). All Hsp82-His6EEF proteins  were stably expressed as full-length proteins to very similar levels (Fig. 2 A), as judged by Coomassie staining and  immunoblotting with anti-EEF antibody. The additional  bands at β�Ό50 and β�Ό60 kD in the Western blot represent  degradation products of the full-length protein that are  generated during the isolation procedure, as they are not  detected on Western blots of cells that had been solubilized in hot SDS immediately upon harvesting (not  shown). Coexpression of mutant proteins at a level equivalent to that of wild-type Hsp82 was without effect on cell  growth. To establish whether the mutant forms of Hsp82 were  able to support cell viability in the absence of wild-type  Hsc82, the plasmid shuffling technique (Sikorski and  Boeke, 1991) was used to replace the wild-type HSC82  gene in strain Ξ”PCLDa/Ξ± with HSP82-His6EEF, mutant  HSP82-His6EEF, or non-tagged wild-type HSP82 as a control. Cotransformed colonies were selected for growth on  5-FOA plates, indicating the functional replacement of  wild-type HSC82. Surprisingly, only colonies containing  either the wild-type HSP82 gene itself, HSP82-His6EEF,  or HSP82(E33D)-His6EEF were viable (Fig. 2 B). In contrast the E33A and the D79N mutants were unable to rescue the Ξ”PCLDa/Ξ± cells from lethality when present as the  only source of Hsp82. These results are consistent with the  view that ATP binding and hydrolysis are critical functional properties of Hsp90 required in vivo.The rescued cells expressing wild-type Hsp82 and Hsp82- His6EEF grew with almost identical rates at 30Β°C (doubling time d = 116 Β± 2 min and 112 Β± 5 min, respectively),  indicating that the His6EEF tag does not compromise the  function of Hsp82 in vivo. In contrast, the cells expressing  Hsp82(E33D)-His6EEF grew more slowly (d = 132 Β± 1  min) but showed no temperature-sensitive phenotype.D79 Is Required for ATP Binding and E47 for ATP  Hydrolysis by Hsp90To determine the molecular basis for the loss of in vivo  function of the mutant Hsp82 proteins analyzed, we expressed the full-length proteins and the respective NH2-terminal domains in soluble form in E. coli and purified  them to homogeneity. Based on the available structural information, it seemed unlikely that the residue E33 contributes significantly to ATP or GA binding. Indeed, the NH2-terminal domain of Hsp82(E33A) bound ATP and GA as  efficiently as the wild-type protein. In contrast, the NH2-terminal domain of Hsp82(D79N) bound ATP much less  efficiently than wild-type protein (Fig. 3 A), confirming  the prediction from the structural model. Having analyzed the binding of ATP, experiments were  performed to establish whether Hsp90 has ATP hydrolytic  activity and to test the possible mechanistic significance of  residue E33 in this reaction. Any ATPase activity measured with Hsp90 has previously been assigned to background contamination (Scheibel et al., 1997). To avoid  such artifacts, we used only highly purified, recombinant  Hsp90 proteins. Furthermore, we reasoned that an authentic Hsp90 ATPase activity should be inhibited by  GA. ATPase activities were measured with a highly sensitive assay monitoring the production of [Ξ±32P]ADP from  [Ξ±32P]ATP by thin layer chromatography. ATP hydrolysis  versus time for the various proteins is plotted in Fig. 3 B,  and Fig. 3 C shows the double-reciprocal plot of the data.  Wild-type Hsp82 and Hsp82(E33D) hydrolyzed ATP with  similar kcat values of 0.44 minβ�’1 and 0.28 minβ�’1, respectively, which is very similar to the ATPase activity of unstimulated mammalian Hsp70 proteins (O'Brien and  McKay, 1993; Wei and Hendershot, 1995). However, the  Km value of Hsp82(E33D) was about threefold higher  than that of wild-type Hsp82 (520 ΞΌM vs. 172 ΞΌM), indicating a significantly reduced affinity for nucleotide. Addition of GA at 180 ΞΌM inhibited the ATPase activity almost completely. A different result was obtained for the  E33A and D79N mutants. The D79N mutant was devoid  of ATPase activity as expected from its inability to bind  ATP specifically. Significantly, the E33A exchange, although preserving the ability of Hsp90 to bind ATP (Fig. 3  A), abolished the capacity of Hsp90 to hydrolyze ATP.  Thus, E33 in the yeast protein, corresponding to E47 in  human Hsp90, is identified as the catalytic residue of the  Hsp90 ATPase, suggesting a mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 similar to that of DNA gyrase (Jackson and  Maxwell, 1993).The Complete Hsp90 Protein Is Required for ATPase ActivityNext, we investigated whether the stably folded NH2-terminal domain of Hsp82 (Stebbins et al., 1997; Prodromou  et al., 1997a) is sufficient for the ATPase activity of Hsp82  or whether additional parts of the molecule are required  for ATP hydrolysis. Surprisingly, although the NH2-terminal domain binds ATP (Fig. 3 A), it did not exhibit detectable catalytic activity in the ATPase assay (Fig. 4). Similarly, no ATPase activity was detected with a variant of  Hsp82, Hsp82Ξ”C (Fig. 4), that lacks the COOH-terminal  dimerization domain (residues 600β€“709; Nemoto et al.,  1995; Wearsch and Nicchitta, 1996), but can be considered  to be native as it was fully soluble after expression in E.  coli and active in prevention of rhodanese aggregation  (Young et al., 1997). Similarly, the NH2-terminal domain  of Hsp82 was properly folded, as it was not only capable of  binding ATP and GA (see Fig. 3 A; Prodromou et al.,  1997a; Stebbins et al., 1997) but also preserved the chaperone function in preventing protein aggregation in vitro  (Young et al., 1997; Scheibel et al., 1998; data not shown).  Thus, the complete Hsp90 protein, presumably as the  dimer, is required for ATP hydrolytic activity. Interestingly, the chaperone function of the isolated NH2-terminal  domain did not exhibit a detectable dependence on specific nucleotide binding (data not shown), suggesting that  ATP hydrolysis may be required for substrate release or  that this function depends on the cooperation of Hsp90  with one or several of its cofactors. Effect of ATPase Mutations on the Interaction of  Hsp90 with p23Recent studies implicated the small acidic protein p23 as  an important cofactor of Hsp90 involved in the maturation  of steroid receptor molecules (Dittmar et al., 1997). Interestingly, Toft and colleagues reported that p23 interacts  with Hsp90 in an ATP-dependent manner (Sullivan et al.,  1997). Initially, it was difficult to reconcile this finding with  the view that Hsp90 neither binds nor hydrolyzes ATP  (Jakob et al., 1996; Scheibel et al., 1997). The recent structural evidence for ATP binding by Hsp82 (Prodromou et al.,  1997a) together with our demonstration that Hsp90 function is dependent on ATP binding and hydrolysis in vivo  provided the basis to resolve this issue. Since point mutations mapping within the first 200 residues of Hsp90 abrogate the interaction between p23 and Hsp90 (Grenert et al.,  1997), we performed a two-hybrid assay to test whether  the NH2-terminal domain of Hsp90 is sufficient for p23  binding. A set of human Hsp90 constructs (Fig. 5 A) in the  pAS2-1 vector served as the bait and was cotransformed  with human p23 into S. cerevisiae strain Y190. Surprisingly, neither of the Hsp90 deletion fragments was sufficient to interact with p23 (Fig. 5 B), although the fragments were expressed to similar levels as the full-length  Hsp90 protein (Young et al., 1998). Only the full-length  Hsp90 polypeptide was able to interact with p23. To test whether ATP binding to Hsp90 is required for  the interaction with p23, two-hybrid assays were performed with the respective mutant forms of Hsp90 (Fig. 5  C). Cells containing wild-type Hsp90, Hsp90(E47D), and  Hsp90(E47A) grew in a manner dependent on the interaction between Hsp90 and p23, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 is not essential for the interaction with p23  measured in vivo. In contrast, no growth was observed  with Hsp90(D93N) in the two-hybrid assay, indicating that  Hsp90 that is defective in nucleotide binding is no more  able to associate with p23. To establish this conclusion  more rigorously, in vitro binding experiments with purified  Hsp82 proteins and yeast p23 (Bohen, 1998; Fang et al.,  1998) were performed. Full-length wild-type and mutant  Hsp82 was purified from E. coli as His6EEF-tagged proteins. Yeast p23 containing an NH2-terminally located T7  immunotag was purified upon expression in E. coli. Wild-type Hsp82 or Hsp82 proteins carrying the mutations  E33A, E33D or D79N were bound to Ni-NTA resin and  subsequently incubated with p23 (see Materials and Methods). Binding of p23 to the immobilized Hsp82 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 6). Significant binding to wild-type Hsp82 and Hsp82(E33D) was  only observed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide ATPΞ³S and was inhibited by GA. In contrast,  Hsp82(E33A) was able to form a complex with p23 in the  presence of hydrolyzable ATP, indicating that p23 interacts with the ATP form of Hsp90. No complex formation  was observed with the D79N mutation of Hsp82, consistent with the lack of detectable nucleotide binding by this  mutant in vitro. These results allow the following conclusions: p23 recognizes the ATP-bound form of Hsp90, but  not the ADP-bound form or the nucleotide-free protein.  As GA inhibits complex formation in the presence of  ATP, the ansamycin antibiotic mimics the ADP state of  Hsp90, not the ATP state, at least as far as the interaction  with p23 is concerned (see Discussion). In the presence of  ATP, mutant Hsp82 carrying the catalytic site mutation  E33A is arrested in the p23-bound state. In contrast, wild-type Hsp82 and Hsp82(E33D) are able to cycle between  the p23-bound ATP state and the p23-free ADP and nonβ€“ nucleotide-bound states. Given the ATP dependence of  p23 binding it might have been expected that p23 regulates  the ATPase of Hsp90. Surprisingly, however, we failed to  detect any effect of p23 on the ATPase activity of purified  Hsp90 (data not shown).

Discussion
he question whether sp90 function is  dependent  has been the subject of a long debate. everal groups reported -dependent conformational changes in sp90  and -regulated co-factor interactions (sermely and  ahn, 1991; sermely et al., 1993; ohnson and oft, 1994,  1995; renert et al., 1997; ullivan et al., 1997). n the  other hand, detailed studies in vitro indicated that the  chaperone function of purified sp90 is  independent  (iech et al., 1992; akob et al., 1996; earsch and icchitta, 1996; cheibel et al., 1997), suggesting that the  -regulated aspects of sp90 function in protein folding are due to the close cooperation between sp90 and  sp70/sc70 (chneider et al., 1996). his view has only  changed recently, based on the crystal structure of the  nucleotide-bound 2-terminal domain of yeast sp90  (rodromou et al., 1997a), and now human sp90 (this  study). owever, whether sp90 hydrolyzes  had remained elusive (renert et al., 1997; rodromou et al.,  1997a; cheibel et al., 1998). sing the crystal structure of  the 2-terminal domain as a guide, site-directed mutations were made in sp90 that affect  binding and hydrolysis differentially. y analyzing these mutants in vivo  and in vitro, we now demonstrate not only that sp90 has  a clearly detectable ase activity, but also that both   binding and hydrolysis are required for sp90 function in vivo. urprisingly, both the ase activity as well  as the interaction of sp90 with the cofactor p23 require  the complete sp90 protein. urthermore, binding and release of p23 by sp90 follows an  hydrolysisβ€“dependent reaction cycle. hese results show that sp90 belongs  to the group of -regulated molecular chaperones.
 binding to sp90 is inhibited by the ansamycin antibiotic  that occupies the  binding site with high  affinity (rodromou et al., 1997a; tebbins et al., 1997), using essentially the same interactions with the binding  pocket as the purine ring of the nucleotide. hus, the cellular effects of  must be interpreted as the consequence of the interruption of the sp90 ase cycle.   blocks the maturation of specific sp90 substrates  (for example hitesell et al., 1994; mith et al., 1995;  chneider et al., 1996; hitesell and ook, 1996; ittmar  and ratt, 1997; tancato et al., 1997) and the re-folding of  certain stress-denatured polypeptides by the sp90 system  (chneider et al., 1996). hereas in some cases treatment  with  has been reported to result in the dissociation of  sp90β€“substrate complexes (for example hitesell et al.,  1994), substrate polypeptides often accumulate on -bound sp90 in an unfolded conformation that is subject  to degradation by the proteasome system (mith et al.,  1995; chneider et al., 1996; ittmar and ratt, 1997). his  effect forms the basis for the potential therapeutic application of  derivatives in depleting the cellular levels of  steroid receptors and sp90-dependent protooncogenic  protein kinases. he accumulation of substrate polypeptide on -bound sp90 can be explained in light of the  recent finding that sp90 contains two distinct sites for the  interaction with substrate polypeptide (oung et al., 1997;  cheibel et al., 1998), one in the 2-terminal domain and  one in the -terminal domain.  binding dissociates bound polypeptide from the 2-terminal domain of  sp90 but not from the -terminal domain, which  seems to have the general capacity to bind unfolded or  partially folded polypeptides exposing hydrophobic surfaces (oung et al., 1997). imilarly,  but not   binding has been shown to lower the affinity of the isolated 2-terminal domain for peptide substrate (cheibel et al., 1998). ince the isolated 2-terminal domain  does not hydrolyze , it is indeed likely that  binding and not  hydrolysis causes the dissociation of  substrate. hose substrates that interact with both the  2- and -terminal domains may maintain their  association with sp90 in the presence of , whereas  other substrates may dissociate completely from sp90  upon  binding. t is also possible that nucleotide binding has an allosteric effect on the -terminal domain,  modulating its polypeptide affinity.
ndeed, the existence of complex, -regulated interactions within the sp90 dimer is likely, based on our surprising finding that both the ase activity and the interaction of sp90 with p23 require the intact sp90  molecule. or example, it is conceivable that within the  sp90 dimer the 2-terminal domains may contact each  other, consistent with recent electron microscopic images  of sp90 obtained by rotary shadowing (earsch and icchitta, 1996). t is interesting in this context that the second domain of  gyrase contains a lysine residue  (337) that interacts with the ³-phosphate of the bound   in the ase domain, perhaps providing a mechanism for signaling the hydrolysis of  to the molecule  as a whole (igley et al., 1991). e notice that in our crystal of the -gβ€“bound 2-terminal domain of sp90  a lysine residue (116), coming from a symmetry-related  molecule, points into the area where the ³-phosphate  would have been. his conserved residue is near the region that differs in the open and closed conformations of  the 2-terminal domain (tebbins et al., 1997). t is fully  solvent exposed in either conformation and has no obvious structural role.
ur findings also help to define the  hydrolysisβ€“ dependent reaction cycle for the binding and release of  p23 by sp90. p23 has been described as a component required for the formation of sp90 complexes containing  high ligand affinity steroid aporeceptor (ohnson et al.,  1994; ohnson and oft, 1995). efore our demonstration  of the ase acctivity of sp90 it has been reported that  -g is required for p23 binding to sp90 and that   disrupts the sp90β€“p23 complex (ohnson and oft,  1995; mith et al., 1995; renert et al., 1997; ullivan et al.,  1997).  complete model of the reaction cycle is now  emerging from the analysis of the sp90 mutants generated in this study. sp90 defective in hydrolyzing bound   still forms the complex with p23 but is unable to dissociate it. n contrast, the presence of -g in the hydrolysis-defective protein does not promote p23 binding.  either does the nucleotide-free protein associate with  p23. hus, p23 binds to the -bound form of sp90 and  dissociates upon  hydrolysis.  binding mimics the  -bound form of sp90 (or the nucleotide-free state)  in that it prevents the interaction of p23 with sp90 in the  presence of . n contrast,  seems to mimic the  -bound form of sp90 with regard to substrate binding to the 2-terminal domain, consistent with the notion that the binding sites on the 2-terminal domain for  p23 and substrate are not identical. otably, the complete  sp90 protein, probably as a dimer, is required for p23  binding. hus, whereas p23 most likely contacts the 2-terminal domain directly, its interaction with sp90 is  clearly more complex.
n contrast to sp90, p23 (ba1p) is not essential in  yeast but increases the efficiency of expression of heterologous steroid receptor (ohen, 1998; ang et al., 1998).  hus, the loss of p23 binding to sp82(79) cannot be  responsible for the lethal phenotype of this mutation.  ather,  binding and hydrolysis by sp90 is functionally required independently of p23, probably in regulating  substrate binding and release. t is possible, however, that  with the mutant sp82(33), that is defective in   hydrolysis, trapping of p23 in the sp90-bound state may  contribute to the functional defect. he mechanism of p23  action is not yet clear. t is possible that p23 generally increases the efficiency of substrate discharge from sp90  by stabilizing the  state of the sp90 2-terminal  domain that has low affinity for polypeptide. uch a function may be important only for a subset of substrates. dditionally, it has been suggested that p23 itself has chaperone properties and may interact with the substrate directly  (ose et al., 1996). hus, it is also possible that p23 may  function in targeting substrates to sp90, similar to the  role of sp40 (na. J) in targeting substrates to Hsp70  (DnaK) (for review see Hartl, 1996). In contrast to Hsp40,  p23 does not stimulate the ATPase activity of its partner  chaperone and thus does not generate the ADP-bound  state of Hsp90 that binds to the substrate more stably.  However, such a function may depend on the presence of  substrate polypeptide and may so far have escaped detection.
