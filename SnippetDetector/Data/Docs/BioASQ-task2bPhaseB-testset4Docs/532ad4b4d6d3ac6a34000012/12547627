To investigate the diversity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain of the cold adapted teleost Trematomus bernacchii, 45 cDNA clones, containing complete or partial sequences of rearranged VH/D/JH segments, were analysed. Clones were isolated from a spleen library constructed by 5' RACE or from an expression library previously constructed and immunoscreened with rabbit anti- T. bernacchii Ig heavy chain antibodies. VH sequences shared, on average, 79.9% nucleotide identity and defined only two gene families referred to as Trbe VH I and Trbe VH II, the latter comprising 89% of the VH sequences analysed in this study. A Southern blot analysis, performed with family specific probes, revealed that there are at least 25 genomic VH genes. A phylogenetic tree showed that Trbe VH I clustered with VH genes belonging to group D and Trbe VH II with those of group C. Four putative distinct D segments were found to contribute to the diversity of CDR3, which showed a high glycine content. The Shannon analysis revealed that FRs are very highly conserved. Of CDRs, CDR2 exhibits a mean entropy value higher than CDR1, contributing to variability in a significant manner. Moreover, eight distinct JH segments were identified. These findings provide several clues suggesting a limited diversity of the VH genes in the Antarctic teleost T. bernacchii.
