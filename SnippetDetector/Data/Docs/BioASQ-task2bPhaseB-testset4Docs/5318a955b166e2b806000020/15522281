This study determines the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on post-infarction left ventricular (LV) remodeling and cardiac function. In mice, on day 1 after myocardial infarction (MI), HGF (0.45 mg/kg per day) was injected into the tail vein for 7 days (n = 12). In the control mice (n = 12), 0.9% sodium chloride was injected instead of HGF. Hemodynamic data were obtained in vehicle treated control and HGF-treated hearts 4 weeks after the onset of MI. In the HGF-treated group, cardiac function was well preserved as indicated by LV pressure-volume relationship. These mice exhibited better LV systolic and diastolic function. The infarcted LV wall in HGF-treated heart was thicker as compared to vehicle treated group. Fibrosis and infarct size of the ventricular wall was significantly reduced in the HGF-treated hearts. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) and Ki67 positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the border area of the HGF-treated infarcted hearts. c-Met and c-kit positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the border area and epicardium. Angiogenesis was significantly enhanced in HGF-treated hearts as determined by vessel density per unit area. A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation. Treatment with HGF improved heart function through angiogenesis, ventricular wall thickening, and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway.
