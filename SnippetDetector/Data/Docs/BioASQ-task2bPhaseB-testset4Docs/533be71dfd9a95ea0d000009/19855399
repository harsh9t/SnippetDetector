<abstract>
Reversible methylation of histone tails serves as either a positive signal recognized by transcriptional assemblies or a negative signal that result in repression. Invading viral pathogens that depend upon the host cell's transcriptional apparatus are also subject to the regulatory impact of chromatin assembly and modifications. Here we show that infection by the alpha-herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), results in the rapid accumulation of chromatin bearing repressive histone H3 Lys9 methylation. To enable expression of viral immediate early (IE) genes, both viruses use the cellular transcriptional coactivator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) to recruit the lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) to the viral immediate early promoters. Depletion of LSD1 or inhibition of its activity with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) results in the accumulation of repressive chromatin and a block to viral gene expression. As HCF-1 is a component of the Set1 and MLL1 histone H3 Lys4 methyltransferase complexes, it thus coordinates modulation of repressive H3 Lys9 methylation levels with addition of activating H3 Lys4 trimethylation marks. Strikingly, MAOIs also block the reactivation of HSV from latency in sensory neurons, indicating that the HCF-1 complex is a crucial component of the reactivation mechanism. The results support pharmaceutical control of histone modifying enzymes as a strategy for controlling herpesvirus infections.

The cellular transcriptional coactivator, -1, is essential for expression of the immediate early genes () of the ±-herpesviruses  and 11. oth viruses utilize virion-encapsidated activators to recruit -1-et/1 histone methyl-transferase () complexes9,12 to the  promoters, resulting in histone 3-lysine 4 (34) trimethylation and initiation of gene transcription12,13. -1 depletion results in increased levels of repressive histone 3-lysine 9 (39) methylation, suggesting a central role for -1 in modulating chromatin modifications that determine viral gene expression.The cellular transcriptional coactivator, HCF-1, is essential for expression of the immediate early genes (IE) of the Ξ±-herpesviruses HSV and VZV11. Both viruses utilize virion-encapsidated activators to recruit HCF-1-Set/MLL1 histone methyl-transferase (HMT) complexes9,12 to the IE promoters, resulting in histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation and initiation of gene transcription12,13. HCF-1 depletion results in increased levels of repressive histone H3-lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, suggesting a central role for HCF-1 in modulating chromatin modifications that determine viral gene expression.

To investigate histone methylation in herpesvirus gene expression, we assessed the state of 34 and 39 methylation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (h. IP) assays using a model VZV IE promoter-reporter (Fig. 1a). In the absence of the VZV IE activator (IE62), repressive H3K9 methylation accumulated on the promoter while in its presence, H3K9 methylation was reduced and positive H3K4 trimethylation was enhanced. This indicated that, in addition to the Set1/MLL1 H3K4 methyl-transferase, an H3K9 demethylase would also be required to modulate the levels of repressive chromatin.

Recently it has been demonstrated that the 39 demethylase activity of ysine pecific emethylase1 (1) is important for nuclear hormone receptor-dependent transcription14β€“16 and cell fate determination17. herefore, we investigated the role of this enzyme in viral  transcription. s shown in ig. 1b, 1 occupied the   promoter-reporter with -1 and et1, in the presence but not absence of the viral activator. urthermore, depletion of 1 resulted in reduced induction of the reporter, demonstrating that 1 was important for 62-mediated activation (ig. 1c).Recently it has been demonstrated that the H3K9 demethylase activity of Lysine Specific Demethylase1 (LSD1) is important for nuclear hormone receptor-dependent transcription14β€“16 and cell fate determination17. Therefore, we investigated the role of this enzyme in viral IE transcription. As shown in Fig. 1b, LSD1 occupied the VZV IE promoter-reporter with HCF-1 and Set1, in the presence but not absence of the viral activator. Furthermore, depletion of LSD1 resulted in reduced induction of the reporter, demonstrating that LSD1 was important for IE62-mediated activation (Fig. 1c).

We next asked if 1 recruitment was dependent upon the coactivator -1. n cells depleted of -1, et1 and 1 occupancy was reduced and correlated with a reduction in 34 trimethylation and an enhancement of 39 methylation (8β€“9 fold, ig. 1d). n contrast, occupancy of the activator 62 was not affected.We next asked if LSD1 recruitment was dependent upon the coactivator HCF-1. In cells depleted of HCF-1, Set1 and LSD1 occupancy was reduced and correlated with a reduction in H3K4 trimethylation and an enhancement of H3K9 methylation (8β€“9 fold, Fig. 1d). In contrast, occupancy of the activator IE62 was not affected.

The ±-herpesviruses  and -1 share similar regulatory mechanisms, including the recruitment of -1 by the respective viral  activators11. s shown in ig. 1e, 1 depletion also reduced the viral-induced expression of an   reporter gene. dditionally, exogenous expression of wild-type 1 stimulated the reporter expression while a catalytic mutant had no significant impact (ig. 1f).The Ξ±-herpesviruses VZV and HSV-1 share similar regulatory mechanisms, including the recruitment of HCF-1 by the respective viral IE activators11. As shown in Fig. 1e, LSD1 depletion also reduced the viral-induced expression of an HSV IE reporter gene. Additionally, exogenous expression of wild-type LSD1 stimulated the reporter expression while a catalytic mutant had no significant impact (Fig. 1f).

To investigate the role of these factors during viral infection, -1 depleted cells were infected with . n non-depleted cells (ig. 2a), promoter occupancy by et1, 1, and 1 were substantial with a high level of 34 trimethylation and near background level of 39 methylation. n contrast, promoter occupancy by et1, , and 1 were decreased in -1 depleted cells with a correlating decrease in 34 trimethylation and increase in repressive 39 methylation (ig. 2b). he requirement for 1 was addressed by infection of an inducible 1-i cell line (ig. 2c). epletion of 60% of the cellular 1 reduced the levels of the  protein by 66% and m. RNA by 78%; indicating that LSD1 was critical for IE gene expression during viral infection.

<sections.6>
In an analogous manner, -1 and 1 occupied the -1  promoter during infection with the correlating high level of 34 and low level of 39 methylation (ig. 2d). urthermore, -1 depletion resulted in a concomitant decrease in the recruitment of 1 (ig. 2e). mportantly, depletion of 1 resulted in reduced viral  proteins and m. RNAs (Fig. 2f) and the levels of IE gene expression were recovered by exogenous expression of wild-type LSD1 but not an LSD1 catalytic mutant or a mutant lacking the amine oxidase domain (Fig. 2g). Strikingly, depletion of LSD1- resulted in accumulation of nucleosomes bearing repressive H3K9 methylation on the viral IE promoter (Fig. 2h). Together, the results demonstrate that the HCF-1-dependent recruitment of LSD1 plays an important role in the initiation of both VZV and HSV-1 infection, likely via modulation of the levels of repressive H3K9 chromatin marks at the IE promoters.

Recruitment of 1 is dependent on -1 (ig. 1d, ig. 2b, and 2e). herefore, we determined if this reflected an interaction by coimmunoprecipitation assays. oth et1- and 1-specific antibodies efficiently coimmunoprecipitated -1 (ig. 2i, top). n addition, immunoprecipitation of either -1 or 1 resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of b. BP5 (Fig. 2i, bottom), a common core subunit of the Set/MLL HMTs18; suggesting that LSD1 was associated with the HCF-1/HMT complex.

L1 has both repressive (34 demethylation) and activating (39 demethylation) activities. emethylation of 34 is mediated by the o. REST/LSD1 complex and targeting or specificity is determined by the associated components19,20. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, CoREST factors were present in the LSD1 immunoprecipitate but absent from the HCF-1/LSD1 complex. Based on these data, we propose that HCF-1 couples the demethylase LSD1 with the Set1/MLL1 HMT in a novel complex, providing both specificities to promote IE gene transcription (Fig. 2j).

Mechanistically,  is unique relative to other identified demethylases, including the members of the mjd family, as it demethylates lysine residues via a flavin-adenine-dinucleotide-dependent reaction21,22. his reaction is inhibited by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (s)15,23β€“25; pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders (clinical depression, anxiety), arkinsonβ€™s, and migraines. urthermore, select s inhibit 1 at levels comparable to inhibition of the clinical mitochondrial  targets23,24. herefore, we investigated the impact of the s argyline and ranylcypromine () on the initiation of  and  infection. or both viruses, treatment with either  resulted in a dose dependent decrease in viral  m. RNA and proteins (Fig. 3aβ€“c). The levels of cellular protein controls were unaffected and no significant cellular toxicity was seen (Supplementary Fig. 2). TCP also reduced viral yields from HSV-infected cells nearly 1000-fold (Fig. 3d). Strikingly, analogous to LSD1 RNAi-mediated depletions (Fig. 2h), nucleosomes bearing repressive marks accumulated on the HSV-1 IE promoter in the presence of either MAOI (Fig. 3e). The results support the model whereby LSD1 prevents accumulation of H3K9 methylation, thereby allowing productive infection by both Ξ±-herpesviruses.

In addition to mono- and di-methyl 39, inhibition of 1 resulted in increased 39-trimethylation and occupancy by the heterochromatin protein 1 (upplementary ig. 3a). s 1 only removes mono- and di-methyl modifications, the increased 39 trimethylation in the absence of 1 may reflect (i) increased levels of dimethyl substrates that accumulate during chromatin assembly or (ii) the requirement for an additional 39 demethylase(s) of the mjd family, in conjunction with 1, to provide the specificity required to remove tri-methylation26,27. he latter is supported by the observation that even in the presence of 1, 39 trimethylation was detected on the  promoters during initial stages of -1 infection (upplementary ig. 3b). rrespective, the requirement for 1 to promote viral  expression identifies it as an essential control component and a target for inhibition of ±-herpesvirus infection.In addition to mono- and di-methyl H3K9, inhibition of LSD1 resulted in increased H3K9-trimethylation and occupancy by the heterochromatin protein 1 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). As LSD1 only removes mono- and di-methyl modifications, the increased H3K9 trimethylation in the absence of LSD1 may reflect (i) increased levels of dimethyl substrates that accumulate during chromatin assembly or (ii) the requirement for an additional H3K9 demethylase(s) of the Jmjd family, in conjunction with LSD1, to provide the specificity required to remove tri-methylation26,27. The latter is supported by the observation that even in the presence of LSD1, H3K9 trimethylation was detected on the IE promoters during initial stages of HSV-1 infection (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Irrespective, the requirement for LSD1 to promote viral IE expression identifies it as an essential control component and a target for inhibition of Ξ±-herpesvirus infection.

In addition to lytic replication, ±-erpesviruses establish latent infections and cycles of reactivation in sensory neurons. n -1, latency and reactivation correlate with alterations in chromatin modifications on the viral  promoters5,28β€“31. ignificantly, -1 is (i) sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated sensory neurons; (ii) rapidly transported to the nucleus upon reactivation stimuli32,33; and (iii) recruited to the viral  promoters at the outset of reactivation34. herefore, given the impact of 1 on viral  gene expression and its association with -1, we investigated the potential role of 1 in viral reactivation by tissue explant of  latently infected trigeminal ganglia (s) in the presence and absence of  (ig. 4a). trikingly,  significantly reduced the reactivation of -1 ( = 0.0043 and 0.0011 for days 2 and 4, respectively). ue to variance in viral loads of individual animals, these results were confirmed by studies in which each half of a  was explanted in the presence and absence of  ( = 0.0002; ig. 4b). oreover, reduced levels of the inhibitor also effectively blocked viral reactivation (ig. 4c). inally, as shown in ig. 4d, potential  toxicity was not responsible for the suppression of viral reactivation as high viral titers were recovered following drug reversal.In addition to lytic replication, Ξ±-Herpesviruses establish latent infections and cycles of reactivation in sensory neurons. In HSV-1, latency and reactivation correlate with alterations in chromatin modifications on the viral IE promoters5,28β€“31. Significantly, HCF-1 is (i) sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated sensory neurons; (ii) rapidly transported to the nucleus upon reactivation stimuli32,33; and (iii) recruited to the viral IE promoters at the outset of reactivation34. Therefore, given the impact of LSD1 on viral IE gene expression and its association with HCF-1, we investigated the potential role of LSD1 in viral reactivation by tissue explant of HSV latently infected trigeminal ganglia (TGs) in the presence and absence of TCP (Fig. 4a). Strikingly, TCP significantly reduced the reactivation of HSV-1 (P = 0.0043 and 0.0011 for days 2 and 4, respectively). Due to variance in viral loads of individual animals, these results were confirmed by studies in which each half of a TG was explanted in the presence and absence of TCP (P = 0.0002; Fig. 4b). Moreover, reduced levels of the inhibitor also effectively blocked viral reactivation (Fig. 4c). Finally, as shown in Fig. 4d, potential TCP toxicity was not responsible for the suppression of viral reactivation as high viral titers were recovered following drug reversal.

These studies suggested that  inhibition of 1 prevented viral reactivation. owever, it remained possible that  inhibited lytic spread of the virus but not the initiating reactivation events. herefore, ganglia were explanted in the presence of  (control), cyclovir (to prevent viral  replication/spread35,36), or . ections were probed with antibodies to an  lytic antigen (8) (ig. 4e and upplementary ig. 4a). n control treated ganglia, clusters of 8+ neurons were detected in multiple sections of 13 of 16 ganglia, representing initiating neurons as well as infected neurons and support cells from lytic spread. n the presence of cyclovir (), distinct 8+ neurons were detected in sections of 9 of 12 ganglia, representing primary neurons undergoing viral reactivation. trikingly, in the presence of , only a single 8+ neuron was detected in 1 of 15 ganglia, clearly demonstrating that  inhibited the initiation of reactivation rather than inhibiting lytic spread ( = .00002). s additional evidence that  inhibits  gene expression and consequently, reactivation of  from latency, viral  m. RNAs could be readily detected by nested RT-PCR from ganglia explanted in the presence of DMSO or ACV but were not detected in the presence of TCP (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 4c).

Together the data support the model (ig. 4g) whereby the genomes of infecting ±-herpesviruses are subject to cell-directed accumulation of repressive chromatin. or productive infection, ±-herpesviruses recruit -1-dependent modification complexes containing 1 and the 34 s et1/1 to prevent the accumulation of repressive chromatin marks and install positive marks. t should be noted that the encapsidated -1 genome is devoid of nucleosomes which are deposited during the initial stage of infection37,38. s positive chromatin marks are installed and viral gene transcription is activated, the levels of associated nucleosomes decrease; likely due to targeted chromatin remodeling. n contrast, inhibition of the -1 complex components results in accumulation of nucleosomes bearing 39 methylation and repression of viral gene expression.Together the data support the model (Fig. 4g) whereby the genomes of infecting Ξ±-herpesviruses are subject to cell-directed accumulation of repressive chromatin. For productive infection, Ξ±-herpesviruses recruit HCF-1-dependent modification complexes containing LSD1 and the H3K4 HMTs Set1/MLL1 to prevent the accumulation of repressive chromatin marks and install positive marks. It should be noted that the encapsidated HSV-1 genome is devoid of nucleosomes which are deposited during the initial stage of infection37,38. As positive chromatin marks are installed and viral gene transcription is activated, the levels of associated nucleosomes decrease; likely due to targeted chromatin remodeling. In contrast, inhibition of the HCF-1 complex components results in accumulation of nucleosomes bearing H3K9 methylation and repression of viral gene expression.

As 1 can demethylate both histone 34 and 39, the coupling of this protein in the -1 et/ methyltransferase complex may enhance 39 demethylation or preferentially target it to this substrate; although additional histone modifications and modification activities may also contribute to the 34 or 39 recognition and specificity. oreover, the presence of the et1/1 34 methyltransferase components in the complex could function to maintain the levels of 34 methylation, even in the presence of 1 34 demethylase activity.As LSD1 can demethylate both histone H3K4 and H3K9, the coupling of this protein in the HCF-1 Set/MLL methyltransferase complex may enhance H3K9 demethylation or preferentially target it to this substrate; although additional histone modifications and modification activities may also contribute to the H3K4 or H3K9 recognition and specificity. Moreover, the presence of the Set1/MLL1 H3K4 methyltransferase components in the complex could function to maintain the levels of H3K4 methylation, even in the presence of LSD1 H3K4 demethylase activity.
