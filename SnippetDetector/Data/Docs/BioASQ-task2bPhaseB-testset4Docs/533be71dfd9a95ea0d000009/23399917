Mice with a mutation in the Clock gene (ClockΔ19) have been identified as a model of mania; however, the mechanisms that underlie this phenotype, and the changes in the brain that are necessary for lithium's effectiveness on these mice remain unclear. Here, we find that cholecystokinin (Cck) is a direct transcriptional target of CLOCK and levels of Cck are reduced in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of ClockΔ19 mice. Selective knockdown of Cck expression via RNA interference in the VTA of wild-type mice produces a manic-like phenotype. Moreover, chronic treatment with lithium restores Cck expression to near wild-type and this increase is necessary for the therapeutic actions of lithium. The decrease in Cck expression in the ClockΔ19 mice appears to be due to a lack of interaction with the histone methyltransferase, MLL1, resulting in decreased histone H3K4me3 and gene transcription, an effect reversed by lithium. Human postmortem tissue from bipolar subjects reveals a similar increase in Cck expression in the VTA with mood stabilizer treatment. These studies identify a key role for Cck in the development and treatment of mania, and describe some of the molecular mechanisms by which lithium may act as an effective antimanic agent.

Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a chronic psychiatric disease that afflicts approximates 1β€“3% of the United States population.1 The underlying cause of BPD is unknown, though there is a growing body of evidence linking disruptions in circadian rhythms with the disease.2 Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and other regions, circadian rhythms are controlled by the molecular clockwork, which is comprised of a series of autoregulatory transcriptional-translational feedback loops. The transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 heterodimerize and activate transcription of target genes, including the Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes which act to inhibit the activity of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex.3 Recent human genetic studies have linked elements of the molecular clockwork to BPD. Polymorphisms in CLOCK and other circadian genes are associated with various aspects of bipolar disorder.4β€“12 In addition, rhythm disruptions and sleep disturbances are common in BPD and often precipitate manic or depressive episodes.13, 14
Mice bearing a dominant negative mutation (Clock β�†19) in the Clock gene15 have a behavioral profile which is very similar to human mania.16, 17 These mice exhibit hyperactivity, decreased anxiety-related and depression-related behavior, and increased preference for rewarding stimuli.16, 17 Furthermore, the majority of these behavioral abnormalities can be reversed with chronic lithium treatment.17 Previous studies from our group have identified an important role for the VTA in the development of this manic-like phenotype. When CLOCK levels are decreased specifically in the VTA of wild type (WT) animals, behaviors similar to Clockβ�†19mice, including hyperactivity and decreased anxiety are induced.18 Conversely, when a functional CLOCK protein is expressed only in the VTA of Clockβ�†19 mice, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behavior are restored to wild type levels.17 Interestingly, the Clockβ�†19 mice also have increased firing and bursting of VTA dopamine neurons which is reversed with chronic lithium treatment.19
Microarray analysis of VTA tissue from Clockβ�†19 mice and WT littermates revealed altered transcription of many genes involved in dopaminergic transmission.16 One of the genes identified as significantly down regulated was the neuropeptide transmitter, cholecystokinin (CCK).16 The sulphatedcarboxy terminal octapeptide, CCK-8S, is the most commonly expressed form in the brain, with larger forms expressed in the gut. The primary action of CCK in the brain is thought to be mediated through the CCKB receptor, which has been shown in cultured striatal neurons to increase intracellular calcium levels.20 Within the VTA and the substantia nigra, CCK is highly co-localized with dopaminergic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), with 40β€“80% of the cells co-expressing dopamine and CCK.21, 22 At VTA dopaminergic terminals, CCK is co-released with dopamine, specifically upon burst firing.23 CCK acts as a negative modulator of dopaminergic transmission in vivo, as infusions of CCK-8S into the NAc inhibit K+-stimulated dopamine release and reduce extracellular dopamine concentrations.24 Behavioral studies using CCK agonists and antagonists find that increased CCK results in increased anxiety and depression-like behavior while CCK receptor blockade is anxiolytic and antidepressant.25 Thus, it is possible that the decreased CCK levels in the VTA of the Clockβ�†19 mice are responsible for their overall manic-like phenotype. Here we wanted to determine the role of CCK in the development of manic-like symptoms in the Clockβ�†19 mutant mice, as well as the reversal of these phenotypes with lithium treatment. Moreover, we wanted to know the mechanism by which CLOCK regulates CCK expression.

Materials and ethods
nimals. Clock β�†19 mutant mice were created by N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea mutagenesis and produce a dominant-negative CLOCK protein defective in transcriptional activation activity as described.26 For all experiments using Clockβ�†19 mutants, 8 to 16 week old adult male mutant (Clockβ�†19; Mut) and wild-type (WT) littermate controls on a mixed BALBc; C57BL/6 background were used. Mice were group housed in sets of 2β€“4 per cage on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 6:00 a.m., lights off at 6:00 p.m) with food and water provided ad libitum. All mouse experiments were performed in compliance with National Institute of Health guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of UT Southwestern Medical Center. All behavioral and molecular assays were performed between ZT 7β€“11.Lithium AdministrationLithium treated mice received 600 mg/l of LiCl in drinking water for 10 days prior to behavioral testing, and throughout the course of the testing. This administration results in a stable serum concentration of lithium in the low therapeutic range for human patients (0.41Β±0.06 mmol/l), with little to no adverse health consequences.17Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)ChIP assays were performed according to methods described previously.27, 28 Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Behavioral AssaysThe locomotor response to novelty, Elevated Plus Maze, Dark/Light test and Forced Swim test all utilized standard protocols and were performed as described previously.18 Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Quantitative PCRcDNA or purified genomic DNA was mixed with buffers, primers, SYBR green, and hot start Taq polymerase in a master mix prepared by a manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Using a Real-Time PCR machine (7500 Real Time PCR machine, Applied Biosystems) PCR reactions were run followed by a dissociation reaction to determine specificity of the amplified product. The amount of gene expression was quantified using the β�†β�†Ct method as previously described.29Reporter and Expression PlasmidsThe wild-type Cck luciferase reporter was described previously.27 Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Luciferase AssaysCell culture and performance of the luciferase assay were carried out as described previously.27 Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Construction of AAV- Cck-shRNA and Virus PurificationA small hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against Cck was designed using previously published criteria.18 For the CckshRNA, a 15 base pair sequence in the coding region of the Cck gene (5β€™-CTTGAGCGGTTCGG-3β€™) was identified as a target region. A previously published scrambled RNA sequence (5β€™-CGGAATTTAGTTACGGGGATCCAC-3β€™) that has no known sequence similarities was used as a negative control. An antisense sequence of selected region and a miR23 loop of 10 nucleotides (CTTCCTGTCA) were added to the 5β€™ end of these sequences. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) plasmid expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Viral production was carried out using a helper-free triple transfection method. Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Laser Capture MicrodissectionLaser capture microdissection (LCM) to assess levels of in vivo Cck knockdown were performed as in previous studies.18 Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Stereotaxic SurgerySurgery was performed as described previously.18 Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Immunohistochemistry and validations of injections and infectionsValidation of injections was performed as published previously.18 Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Subject selection and tissue acquisitionHuman brain tissue from depression and control cases was obtained from the Dallas Brain Collection.30 The tissue was collected only after acquiring consent from the next of kin along with permission to review medical records and to conduct a telephone interview with a primary caregiver. All clinical information on each case was evaluated by at least three research psychiatrists and diagnoses made using DSM IV criteria. Blood screens for drugs of abuse, alcohol and prescription medications were conducted on each case. Cases were excluded when there was a known history of neurological disorders or of an axis I psychiatric condition other than major depression. The method of collection and storage of human brain tissue is approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.Human tissue preparationIn each case, cerebral hemispheres were cut coronally into 1β€“1.5 cm blocks and the midbrain was cut into 1β€“1.5 cm blocks in a plane perpendicular to its long axis as previously described31. Additional details are in the Supplemental Material.Statistical analysisFor the comparison of two groups, two-tailed unpaired Studentβ€™s t tests were used,and one-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni post tests for multiple comparisons were performed for the comparison of three or more groups. When more than one factor was examined simultaneously, two-way ANOVAs were performed followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.In all figures error bars show S.E.M.

Results
 is a direct  target gene in the o determine if the previously observed decrease in ckm  levels was a direct or indirect result of the lockβ�†19 mutation, we measured  binding at the ck promoter. he ck promoter contains an -box element () that is part of a 110 bp proximal promoter region that is over 80% conserved from mouse to human.32 n addition to the -box, there is also a -rich region, / site, and putative  box (igure 1a). o assess potential  binding at the ck promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (h. IP) assays were carried out on VTA-containing tissue from WT andClockβ�†19 littermates. CLOCK was enriched at the Cck promoter above background in both genotypes with no significant difference between the two (Figure 1b). To further elucidate the role of CLOCK in the transcriptional regulation of the Cck gene, luciferase assays were performed in PC12 cells using Cck-luc reporter plasmids containing approximately 300 bp of the Cck proximal promoter region with either an intact or a mutated E-box site. When this reporter plasmid was co-transfected into cells along with CLOCK and BMAL1 expression constructs, a significant increase in Cck-luc reporter activity was observed when the E-box was intact (Figure 1c). When the E-box was mutated, the ability of transfected CLOCK/BMAL1 to induce Cck-luc reporter activity was abolished (Figure 1c). These results demonstrate that CLOCK acts as a direct, positive regulator of the Cck gene in an E-box dependent manner. Furthermore, the decrease in Cck gene expression observed in the Clockβ�†19 mice is not due to a loss of CLOCK binding at the promoter, but rather a loss of function of the CLOCK protein as a transcriptional regulator.Cck expression in the ClockΞ”19 mice is reduced due to a lack of MLL1 binding at the promoterPrevious in vitrostudies have found that CLOCK activates transcription via interactions with histone methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia 1(MLL1), which then causes tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and allows for transcriptional activation of CLOCK target genes.33 To determine if this is the case in vivo at the Cck promoter, ChIP assays were carried out using an antibody against MLL1. We found a significant decrease in both MLL1 and H3K4me3 levels at the Cck promoter in the midbrain of the Clockβ�†19 mice compared to WT animals (Figure 1d, e). Thus, Cck levels are likely reduced in the ClockΞ”19 mice due to the inability of MLL1 to bind CLOCKΞ”19 protein, leading to a decrease in H3K4me3.Knock-down of CCK in the VTA of WT animals results in a manic-like phenotypeTo determine if a loss of Cck expression in the VTA is sufficient to induce manic-like behaviors, an AAV-shRNA directed specifically against Cck was generated (AAV-Cck-shRNA). An AAV-scrambled sequence (AAV-Scr) that does not match any known gene was used as a control.18 Stereotaxic injection of AAV-Cck-shRNA into the VTA of C57BL6J mice resulted in a significant (~6-fold) decrease in Cck mRNA levels after 3 weeks incubation compared to AAV-Scr controls (Supplemental Figure 1). Following the confirmation of knock-down, a separate cohort of mice injected with AAV-Cck-shRNA or AAV-Scr were then subjected to a battery of behavioral tests. When exposed to a novel environment, mice injected with AAV-Cck-shRNA in the VTA were significantly hyperactive compared to those injected with AAV-Scr over the course of two hours (Figure 2a). Mice were then subjected to two anxiety-related behavioral tests: the elevated plus maze and light/dark box. AAV-Cck-shRNA injected mice spent significantly more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and in the light side of the light/dark box, suggesting that they have decreased anxiety (Figure 2b, c). We then determined the effects of Cck knock-down on depression-related behavior by subjecting animals to the Porsolt forced swim test. Decreased immobility time and an increase in latency to first bout of immobility was observed in mice injected with AAV-Cck-shRNA in the VTA compared to AAV-Scr control mice (Figure 2d, 2e). Together these results indicate that a knock-down of Cck in the VTA decreases anxiety and depression-related behavior.Lithium selectively restores Cck expression levels in Clockβ�†19 miceSince we were able to determine that a decrease in Cck is sufficient to induce manic-like behaviors, and lithium treatment rescues Clockβ�†19 mutant behavior17, we investigated whether Cck levels were altered by lithium treatment. mRNA was isolated from the VTA of Clockβ�†19 and littermate control mice receiving either chronic lithium (600 mg/L in drinking water) or normal drinking water, and qPCR was performed to assess Cck mRNA levels. Consistent with our previous microarray results16, Cck expression was decreased in Clockβ�†19 mice relative to WT littermates (Figure 3a). When Clockβ�†19 mice were administered lithium, Cck mRNA levels were restored to near WT levels (Figure 3a). Interestingly, lithium treatment had no detectable effect on WT Cck mRNA levels (Figure 3a) suggesting a specific effect in mice with a manic-like phenotype.Regulation of chromatin structure at the Cck promoter by lithium treatmentWe wanted to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms by which lithium treatment regulates the Cck gene. ChIP assays were carried out using an antibody against H3K4me3 in Clockβ�†19 mice receiving either water or lithium. Lithium treatment in Clockβ�†19 mice led to an increase of H3K4me3 at the Cck promoter (Figure 3b) and a trend toward increased levels of MLL1 at the Cck promoter in Clockβ�†19 mice, though this did not reach significance (Figure 3c). This suggests that other histone methyltranferases are likely involved. Lithium treatment had no significant effect on H3K4me3 or MLL1 levels at the Cck promoter in WT animals (Supplemental figure 2). We then wanted to determine whether lithium could regulate histone acetylation at the Cck promoter. ChIP assays were carried out using antibodies against AcH3 and AcH4 in Clockβ�†19 mice and WT controls receiving either water or lithium (Figure 3d, e). Lithium treatment caused a selective increase in levels of both AcH3 and AcH4 at the Cck promoter in Clockβ�†19 mice, while levels of AcH3 and AcH4 are not significantly affected in WT mice (Figure 3d, e). To determine how lithium treatment results in recruitment of chromatin remodeling enzymes to the Cck promoter, we assessed whether there were any changes in mutant CLOCK protein binding to the Cck promoter. A significant reduction in CLOCKΞ”19 protein at the Cck promoter was observed in Clockβ�†19 mice receiving lithium treatment, suggesting that lithium causes another DNA-binding protein to compete with CLOCKΞ”19 and this results in recruitment of chromatin remodeling enzymes that rescue expression (Figure 3f).Cck levels are altered in human subjects with bipolar disorder following treatmentBecause a restoration of Cck levels in the VTA seems to correlate with the therapeutic actions of lithium in the Clockβ�†19 mice, we wanted to determine if Cck levels were also regulated by drugs that treat BPD in human postmortem tissue. RNA was isolated from the VTA of healthy control and BPD subjects, which were categorized as either on or off medication at the time of death. Information on individual human postmortem samples is detailed in Tables S2, S3, and S4. qPCR was performed to assess Cck mRNA levels. While there was no detectable difference in Cck levels in the VTA between control subjects and BPD patients not receiving medication (Figure 4), interestingly, BPD patients receiving pharmacological treatment had a significant increase in Cck levels in the VTA (Figure 4).Increased Cck levels in the VTA are required for the therapeutic effects of lithium in Clockβ�†19 miceWe injected AAV-Cck-shRNA or AAV-Scr into the VTA of Clockβ�†19 mice. The mice then received chronic lithium treatment or normal drinking water to determine if lithium could still rescue Clockβ�†19 anxiety and depression related behavior when it was unable to restore proper Cck levels. Clockβ�†19 mice injected with AAV-Cck-shRNA were hyperactive compared to AAV-Scr controls (Figure 5a). Consistent with previous findings17, this lithium treatment paradigm had no detectable effect on locomotor activity in animals injected with either virus (Figure 5a). The mice were then subjected to the elevated plus maze and dark/light box to measure anxiety-related behavior. Importantly, lithium had no effect on the Clockβ�†19 mice injected with the AAV-Cck-shRNA in the VTA while it was able to normalize the anxiety-related behavior in the mice injected with the AAV-Scr as measured by the percent open arm time of the EPM (Figure 5b) and the percent time in the light in the dark/light box (Figure 5c). Mice were then subjected to the forced swim test to measure depression-related behavior. Similar to what was observed in the anxiety-related behavioral tests, lithium was successful in reversing the time spent immobile and the latency to immobility in the Clockβ�†19 mice injected with AAV-Scr but it had no effect on the mice injected with AAV-Cck-shRNA in the VTA (Figure 5d, e). These results demonstrate that an increase in Cck levels in the VTA is necessary for lithium to have therapeutic effects.

Discussion
ur results identify the peptide neurotransmitter ck as a novel and direct transcriptional target of the  protein in the .  acts as a positive regulator of the ck gene via its interactions at the -box element of the ck promoter. t is likely that  also contributes to the strong circadian rhythm in ck expression.34, 35 s expected by the sequence of the β�†19 protein, this protein can still bind to the ck promoter but cannot activate transcription. e find that levels of 34me3, a histone modification associated with transcriptional activation, are decreased at the ck promoter when compared to  mice. his is likely due to the inability of the mutant form of  to associate with 1, which was also found to be decreased at the ck promoter in lockβ�†19 mice relative to  littermates. hough this lack of association was thought to underlie the dominant negative function of β�†19 based on findings in cell culture at other gene promoters, we provide the first evidence to suggest that this is indeed the case in the brain, and that this interaction is important for regulation at the ck promoter.
urthermore, we have determined that a knock-down of ck in the  produces a manic-like phenotype similar to the lockβ�†19 mice. -mediated knock-down of ck specifically in the  results in hyperactivity, decreased anxiety-related behavior, and a decrease in depression-related behavior. hese results correspond well to previous studies with systemic administration of  receptor antagonists, which are anxiolytic and antidepressant.36 37 ince these changes in behavior are very similar to those seen in the lockβ�†19 mice, the β€�manic-likeβ€� phenotype of these mice may ultimately be due to a decrease in ck levels in the . nterestingly, the behavioral effects of ck knock-down differ somewhat from those observed in mice that have -mediated knock-down of  specifically in the , which results in hyperactivity and decreased anxiety, but also results in an increase in depression related behavior when compared to control animals.18 iven the nature of viral mediated gene transfer and the fact that this was a gene knock-down experiment rather than an overexpression of the β�†19 protein, there are a number of possibilities that might explain this discrepancy and it will be interesting to explore these in future studies.
hronic lithium administration results in a restoration of ck m. RNA to near WT levels in the VTA of the Clockβ�†19 mice with no detectable effect on WT Cck levels. This finding makes Cck a particularly promising target as lithium treatment selectively rescues the Clockβ�†19 mouse behavior while having little effect on WT animals.17 This is similar to what is observed in the human population, as lithium is effective in the treatment of bipolar mania, but has little or variable effect on healthy controls.38, 39 Therefore, the selective regulation of Cck by lithium may be of particular therapeutic relevance.
Indeed, we find an increase in Cck levelsin human BPD patients receiving pharmacological treatments. Unlike Clockβ�†19 mice which have a large decrease in Cck in the VTA there was no detectable difference in Cck expression between normal controls and BPD patients not receiving medications. However, there were very few patients in this group with a great deal of variability in Cck levels. It is also possible that a decrease inCck may be only evident in a manic state, which is more similar to the phenotype of the Clockβ�†19 mice, and the mood state of the BPD patients at the time of tissue collection was not known.
Lithium treatment leads to a restoration of H3K4me3 levels at the Cck promoter in Clock β�†19 mice without affecting WT animals. This rescue of H3K4me3 is not accompanied by a significant increase in MLL1 at the Cck promoter, indicating that factors other than MLL1 likely contribute to lithiumβ€™s effects on H3K4me3 in the Clockβ�†19 mice. In addition to an increase in H3K4me3, an increase in AcH3 and AcH4 was observed at the Cck promoter in the Clockβ�†19 mice following lithium treatment. It has recently become clear that H3K4me3 and histone acetylation are linked, and there is a large amount of crosstalk between proteins that deposit these modifications on histone tails.40β€“43 Interestingly there is no decrease in levels of AcH3 or AcH4 at the Cck promoter in untreated Clockβ�†19 mice, despite the decrease in H3K4me3. This is probably due to the fact that CLOCKβ�†19, though unable to recruit MLL1, still retains its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity.33, 44,45 Interestingly, this increase in histone acetylation and methylation specifically occurs in the context of a disease state (i.e. a manic-like phenotype) and does not occur in wild type animals. This might explain why previous animal studies have not identified lithium as a drug that alters chromatin structure. The increase in AcH3 and AcH4 following lithium treatment is likely due to the recruitment of HATs rather than an inhibition of HDAC proteins which is an activity that may underlie the efficacy of valproic acid as a mood stabilizing drug.46 Lithium treatment leads to a decrease in CLOCKΞ”19 levels at the Cck promoter in the Clockβ�†19 mice, suggesting that another protein or transcriptional-activation complex is competing with CLOCKβ�†19 for Cck promoter occupancy. Future studies will determine what this factor is and how lithium acts to bring this factor to the Cck promoter.
The increase in Cck produced by lithium is necessary for its therapeutic effects in the Clockβ�†19 mice, as Clockβ�†19 mice injected with AAV-Cck-shRNA into the VTA no longer respond to lithium treatment. Interestingly, Cck knock-down in wild type mice results in a hyperactive locomotor response to novelty, and the Clockβ�†19 mice are hyperactive, however, lithium treatment has no effect on locomotor activity in the Clockβ�†19 mice either with or without injection of the AAV-Cck-shRNA. These results clearly separate hyper-locomotor activity from measures of anxiety and depression-related behavior, giving us further confidence in the interpretation of these measures. Moreover, it suggests a separate mechanism by which these processes are regulated.
In conclusion, we have identified a novel CLOCK target gene, Cck, which likely contributes to the phenotype of the ClockΞ”19 mice since a decrease in Cck expression in the VTA results in a manic-like phenotype. The decrease in Cck transcription in the Clockβ�†19 mice is likely due to the inability of CLOCKβ�†19 to interact with the histone methyltransferase, MLL1, which results in a decrease of H3K4me3 at the Cck promoter. In addition, we have determined that an increase in Cck mRNA levels in the VTA is necessary for lithiumβ€™s therapeutic actions in the Clockβ�†19 mice. Lithium regulates the Cck gene via an increase in H3K4me3, AcH3, and AcH4 at the Cck promoter in the Clock β�†19mice. The precise mechanism by which these histone modificationsare increased at the Cck promoter following lithium treatment will be the subject of future studies. The hope is that these studies will help identify more selective therapeutic targets for the development of novel mood stabilizing medications which may be more effective with fewer side effects than current treatments.
