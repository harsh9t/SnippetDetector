Alterations in TR [thyroid hormone (TH) receptor]1 isoform expression have been reported in models of both physiologic and pathologic cardiac hypertrophy as well as in patients with heart failure. In this report, we demonstrate that TH induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and, moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38. Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.
