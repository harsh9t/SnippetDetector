AIM: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial pathology affecting 5-10% of the female population. Usually occurs with oligo/amenorrhea, anovulation, hirsutism, polycystic ovaries. Hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance has been causally linked to all features of the syndrome. It has been demonstrated that by reducing hyperinsulinemia, in particular with the administration of metformin, insulin-lowering agents might improve endocrine and reproductive abnormalities in PCOS patients. METHODS: A new molecule with insulin-sensitizing properties, myo-inositol, has recently been successfully administered in women with PCOS. New associations between natural substances like myo-inositol and other components have been proposed to improve the therapeutical efficacy. Among these substances, the monacolin K, a natural statin appeared to have important actions in cholesterol synthesis. In this article we study the effect of inositol alone and the association between myo-inositol and monacolinin K in the treatment of PCOS with insulin resistance, menstrual irregularities and hirsutism. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated a good efficacy of both treatments, although in the group treated with the combination of myo-inositol/monacolin K improvement in lipids and hyperandrogenism were significantly better.
