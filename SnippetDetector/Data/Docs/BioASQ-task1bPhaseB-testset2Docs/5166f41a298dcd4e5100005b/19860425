The methylation marks on chromatin established by histone methyltransferases (s) are key elements of heritable cell states and can lead to disease when disregulated.1,2 hus, it was of interest that a compound containing a 2-amidobenzimidazole skeleton was reported to inhibit several s.(3) ethods to synthesize this skeleton require multiple-step sequences that do not easily lend themselves to syntheses of many structural analogues.(4) o overcome this obstacle, we describe here the direct β�’ functionalization of benzimidazoles with nitrogen-containing reagents via a copper()-mediated oxidative coupling that affords 2-amidobenzimidazoles.The methylation marks on chromatin established by histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are key elements of heritable cell states and can lead to disease when disregulated.1,2 Thus, it was of interest that a compound containing a 2-amidobenzimidazole skeleton was reported to inhibit several HMTs.(3) Methods to synthesize this skeleton require multiple-step sequences that do not easily lend themselves to syntheses of many structural analogues.(4) To overcome this obstacle, we describe here the direct Cβ�’H functionalization of benzimidazoles with nitrogen-containing reagents via a copper(II)-mediated oxidative coupling that affords 2-amidobenzimidazoles.

We anticipated that the aerobic cross-coupling of heterocycles () with nucleophiles would lead to the 2-amido-substituted heterocycles () through the organocopper intermediate () in analogy to the hanβ�’am oxidative coupling of arylboronic acids and nucleophiles (cheme 1).5β�’7We anticipated that the aerobic cross-coupling of heterocycles (I) with nucleophiles would lead to the 2-amido-substituted heterocycles (III) through the organocopper intermediate (II) in analogy to the Chanβ�’Lam oxidative coupling of arylboronic acids and nucleophiles (Scheme 1).5β�’7

We first examined the reaction of -methylbenzimidazole (1) with pyrrolidinone (2a) in the presence of catalytic copper salts under 1 atm of 2. n the initial screening of u sources, r. ΓΈnsted bases, and solvents, optimal results were observed with 0.2 equiv of Cu(OAc)2 and 2 equiv of Na2CO3 with pyridine as additive in toluene.(8) The dimeric product 4 was observed in many conditions, but its formation was suppressed and the yield of 3a was increased by using 5 equiv of nucleophile (Table 1, entry 1). Among the Cu sources tested, Cu(OAc)2 generally performed better than CuCl2, CuBr2, Cu(OTf)2, and Cu(O2CCF3)2.

We next varied the nucleophiles in this reaction (able 1). yclic amide (entries 2 and 3), urea and carbamate (entries 4β�’6) nucleophiles, and -methyl benzenesulfonamide (entry 7) provided the desired products effectively, while acyclic secondary amides were not effective under similar reaction conditions.  wide range of primary amides was found to undergo the reaction (able 1, entries 8β�’16). he reaction with benzamide 2h using a catalytic amount of u(c)2 formed product 3h; however, the starting material 1 was not effectively consumed. his may be due to the binding of u() to the carbonyl oxygen and imino nitrogen in the product. his problem was circumvented by using 2 equiv of u(c)2 (entry 8). oth electron-withdrawing and electron-donating functional groups are tolerated well on the aryl ring of the amides (entries 9β�’12). imple alkyl primary amides are also substrates (entries 13 and 14), even ones with steric bulk on the amide. eactions of 1 with sulfonamides resulted in excellent yields (entries 15 and 16), including one with a bromine substituent on the aryl group. lthough reactions with amines under the same conditions provided the desired products, the formation of the dimeric product 4 was significant, most likely due to strong electron donation by the amine and the unfavorable deprotonation.We next varied the nucleophiles in this reaction (Table 1). Cyclic amide (entries 2 and 3), urea and carbamate (entries 4β�’6) nucleophiles, and N-methyl benzenesulfonamide (entry 7) provided the desired products effectively, while acyclic secondary amides were not effective under similar reaction conditions. A wide range of primary amides was found to undergo the reaction (Table 1, entries 8β�’16). The reaction with benzamide 2h using a catalytic amount of Cu(OAc)2 formed product 3h; however, the starting material 1 was not effectively consumed. This may be due to the binding of Cu(II) to the carbonyl oxygen and imino nitrogen in the product. This problem was circumvented by using 2 equiv of Cu(OAc)2 (entry 8). Both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating functional groups are tolerated well on the aryl ring of the amides (entries 9β�’12). Simple alkyl primary amides are also substrates (entries 13 and 14), even ones with steric bulk on the amide. Reactions of 1 with sulfonamides resulted in excellent yields (entries 15 and 16), including one with a bromine substituent on the aryl group. Although reactions with amines under the same conditions provided the desired products, the formation of the dimeric product 4 was significant, most likely due to strong electron donation by the amine and the unfavorable deprotonation.

We also investigated the scope of this reaction with other heterocyclic and aromatic β�’ bonds (able 2). n the amidation reactions with pyrrolidinone 2a, the heterocyclic β�’ bonds of benzothiazole, caffeine, and oxazole all underwent oxidative coupling (entries 1β�’3). imilar reactions with primary amide 2i were successful (entries 4 and 5), and intramolecular reactions delivered cyclic products with excellent yields (entries 6 and 7). he reaction condition was also effective for the direct amidation of β�’ bonds in fluorinated aromatic rings, albeit in diminished yields (entries 8β�’10). hese transformations offer successful examples of challenging intermolecular β�’ bond formation using aromatic β�’ and amide β�’ groups. hese amidation reactions (entries 8β�’10) indicate the potential of this method in the synthesis of fluorobenzene derivatives.We also investigated the scope of this reaction with other heterocyclic and aromatic Cβ�’H bonds (Table 2). In the amidation reactions with pyrrolidinone 2a, the heterocyclic Cβ�’H bonds of benzothiazole, caffeine, and oxazole all underwent oxidative coupling (entries 1β�’3). Similar reactions with primary amide 2i were successful (entries 4 and 5), and intramolecular reactions delivered cyclic products with excellent yields (entries 6 and 7). The reaction condition was also effective for the direct amidation of Cβ�’H bonds in fluorinated aromatic rings, albeit in diminished yields (entries 8β�’10). These transformations offer successful examples of challenging intermolecular Cβ�’N bond formation using aromatic Cβ�’H and amide Nβ�’H groups. These amidation reactions (entries 8β�’10) indicate the potential of this method in the synthesis of fluorobenzene derivatives.

Although mechanisms of copper-catalyzed oxidative β�’ couplings have been proposed,(6) the details remain uncertain.  proposed mechanism for this amidation reaction is outlined in cheme 2. n the presence of u() and base, we imagine that organocopper intermediate 1a from the heterocycle (e.g., 1) is formed. igand exchange with the deprotonated nucleophile would yield intermediate 1b. β�’ reductive elimination and aerobic reoxidation of the catalyst would complete the catalytic cycle.Although mechanisms of copper-catalyzed oxidative Cβ�’N couplings have been proposed,(6) the details remain uncertain.

Since the formation of 1b can compete with the formation of 1c, dimer 4 will form when 1b is disfavored by slow deprotonation (e.g., p. Ka > 25 or amine) or steric hindrance (e.g., primary vs secondary amides). Reactions with pyridone (pKa = 17) and phthalimide (pKa = 8.3) only resulted in the recovery of starting material, which suggests that the nucleophilicity of the substrates plays an important role in the reaction, presumably by facilitating the Cβ�’N reductive elimination step.
