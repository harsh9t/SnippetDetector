Global patterns of histone methylation are remodelled during cleavage development. Of the five histone methyltransferases known to mediate methylation of the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9), euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2; also known as G9a) has been shown to be a primary mediator of H3K9 dimethylation; BIX-01294 has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of EHMT2. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of BIX-01294 treatment on global H3K9 dimethylation in porcine embryos. We hypothesised that inhibition of EHMT2 by BIX-01294 would result in reduced levels of H3K9 dimethylation and compromised embryo development. Our results showed that incubation in 5ÂµM BIX-01294 markedly reduced global levels of H3K9 dimethylation at the pronuclear, 2-cell and 4-cell stages of development and resulted in developmental arrest before blastocyst formation. Although transient exposure of embryos to BIX-01294 did not alter in vitro development, embryos transiently exposed to BIX-01294 did not establish pregnancy. These data demonstrate that BIX-01294 is a potent inhibitor of H3K9 dimethylation and that transient alterations in global histone modifications can have profound effects on embryo developmental potential.
