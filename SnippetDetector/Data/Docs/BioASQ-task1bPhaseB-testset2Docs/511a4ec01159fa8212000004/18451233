PURPOSE: Although microRNAs have recently been recognized as riboregulators of gene expression, little is known about microRNA expression profiles in serous ovarian carcinoma. We assessed the expression of microRNA and the association between microRNA expression and the prognosis of serous ovarian carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty patients diagnosed with serous ovarian carcinoma and eight patients treated for benign uterine disease between December 2000 and September 2003 were enrolled in this study. The microRNA expression profiles were examined using DNA microarray and Northern blot analyses. RESULTS: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients. In addition, the expression levels of some microRNAs were correlated with the survival in patients with serous ovarian carcinoma. Higher expression of miR-200, miR-141, miR-18a, miR-93, and miR-429, and lower expression of let-7b, and miR-199a were significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that dysregulation of microRNAs is involved in ovarian carcinogenesis and associated with the prognosis of serous ovarian carcinoma.
