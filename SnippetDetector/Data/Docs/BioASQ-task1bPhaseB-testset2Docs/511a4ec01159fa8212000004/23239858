BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of corn-derived biodiesel glycerol on microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs, which play a central role in regulating cell survival, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inbred Balb/c mice were treated with purified glycerol from biodiesel for 24 hours. After administration, we determined the expressions of miR-21, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-93, miR-143, miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-155, miR-196a, miR-203, miR-205, miR-221 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells-1 (NfÎºb1), mitogen-activated protein kinase-8 (Mapk8) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) genes in the liver of mice. RESULTS: We found a parallel altered expression of miRNAs and mRNAs in animals consuming biodiesel glycerol that compared to control mice; these alterations reached significant levels only in few cases. CONCLUSION: Biodiesel glycerol presents no higher risk for carcinogenicity or toxicity.
