We have recently demonstrated that nutritional bioactives (fish oil and pectin) modulate microRNA molecular switches in the colon. Since integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression at an early stage of colon cancer development is lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In addition, diet and carcinogen exposure modulated a number of microRNAs (miR-16, miR-19b, miR-21, miR26b, miR27b, miR-93, and miR-203) linked to canonical oncogenic signaling pathways. Complementary gene expression analyses showed that oncogenic PTK2B, PDE4B, and TCF4 were suppressed by the chemoprotective diet at both the mRNA and protein levels.
