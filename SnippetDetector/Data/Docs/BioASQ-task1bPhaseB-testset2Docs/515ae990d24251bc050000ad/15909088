The myotoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been known for decades. Limb-girdle weakness due to a vacuolar myopathy may occur occasionally in a dose-dependent manner during the first 24 months on chloroquine. However, we report on a case in which muscular weakness developed after a daily intake of 250 chloroquine phosphate (= 155 mg chloroquine base) for a period of 7 years. Even after long-term and apparently well-tolerated chloroquine treatment, the occurrence of severe side-effects is possible.
