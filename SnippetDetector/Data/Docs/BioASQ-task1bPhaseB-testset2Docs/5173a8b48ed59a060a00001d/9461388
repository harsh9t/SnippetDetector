The characteristic AA(TT) sequence pattern of the nucleosome DNA derived earlier is used for prediction of nucleosome positions around splice junctions of eukaryotic genes. Two large datasets (2000 sequences each) were collected consisting of DNA segments with the exon/intron and intron/exon splice junctions, from various eukaryotic species. Positions of predicted nucleosomes near the junction sites were calculated. Those junctions which are found to belong to the nucleosomes, are located preferentially within a few base pairs from the midpoint of the nucleosome DNA. That is, obligatory GT- and AG-ends of the introns are more frequently located near the nucleosome dyad axis, within the best protected middle 10-15 base pairs of the nucleosome DNA. In addition, a tendency is observed for the strongest nucleosomes to form more often in the introns, in accordance with the hypothesis on the chromatin-organizing role of introns.
