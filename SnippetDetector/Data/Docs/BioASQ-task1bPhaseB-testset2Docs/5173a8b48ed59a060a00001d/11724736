<abstract>
A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied for investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient nucleosome positioning sites.
