We have compared the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on endocrine, metabolic, inflammatory and cardiovascular responses in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) after major surgery. Twenty patients who were expected to require 8 h of post-operative sedation and ventilation were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2-2.5 microg kg(-1) h(-1) or propofol 1-3 mg kg(-1) h(-1). Arterial pressure, heart rate and sequential concentrations of circulating cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone, prolactin, insulin, glucose and interleukin 6 were measured. An ACTH stimulation test was performed in all patients who received dexmedetomidine. Heart rate was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine patients. There were no differences in arterial pressure, cortisol, ACTH, prolactin and glucose concentrations between the two groups. A positive response to the ACTH stimulation test varied depending on the diagnostic criteria used. The insulin concentration was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group at 2 h (P=0.021), although this did not affect blood glucose concentrations. Growth hormone concentrations were significantly higher in dexmedetomidine-treated patients overall (P=0.036), but circulating concentrations remained in the physiological range. Interleukin 6 decreased in the dexmedetomidine group. We conclude that dexmedetomidine infusion does not inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis when used for short-term sedation after surgery.
