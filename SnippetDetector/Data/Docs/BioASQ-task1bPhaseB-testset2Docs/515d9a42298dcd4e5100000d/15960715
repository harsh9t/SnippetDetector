This prospective, clinical trial evaluated the effects of short-term propofol administration on triglyceride levels and serum pancreatic enzymes in children undergoing sedation for magnetic resonance imaging. Laboratory parameters of 40 children, mean age (SD; range) 67 (66; 4-178) months undergoing short-term sedation were assessed before and 4 h after having received propofol. Mean (SD) propofol loading dose was 2.2 (1.1) mg.kg(-1) followed by continuous propofol infusion of 6.9 (0.9) mg.kg(-1).h(-1). Serum lipase levels (p = 0.035) and serum triglyceride levels (p = 0.003) were raised significantly after propofol administration but remained within normal limits. No significant changes in serum pancreatic-amylase levels were seen (p = 0.127). In two (5%) children, pancreatic enzymes and in four (10%) children triglyceride levels were raised above normal limits; however, no child showed clinical symptoms of pancreatitis. We conclude that even short-term propofol administration with standard doses of propofol may have a significant effect on serum triglyceride and pancreatic enzyme levels in children.
