INTRODUCTION: Drug use is a well-kown risk factor for cerebrovascular disease in young people. Cannabis is the most widely consumed among the illicit drugs worldwide, but it has only exceptionally been associated to cerebrovascular disease. CLINICAL CASE: We here describe 2 young patients (26 and 29 years, respectively) who suffered from ischemic stroke in temporal relation with cannabis consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The review of the literature on this topic reveals another 18 patients with stroke in association to cannabis use. They all were young people with ischemic stroke. Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke.
