We describe a case series of five adolescents who were managed with lidocaine 5% patches for chronic localized neuropathic pain from a variety of causes with minimal adverse effects. Treatment was effective in four of five patients with only one patient complaining of minimal pain relief. 5% Lidocaine patches have been used for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain in adults and we have found this to be effective in management of localized neuropathic pain in children and adolescents.
