Two inhibitors of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been introduced as adjuncts to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients. Both have been shown to provide PD patients with increased "on" time, decreased "off" time, and improved motor scores. There are, however, a number of practical issues that must be considered in order to achieve maximal benefits with this class of agent. They include dosing and administration, efficacy, adverse events, and patient education. In general, these agents are easy to administer and well tolerated. Both the benefits and the principal side effects of treatment are related to increased dopaminergic activity. Patients must be advised of possible side effects so that they can be reported in a timely manner. Physicians must appreciate that dopaminergic side effects, such as dyskinesia, should be controlled by adjusting the dose of levodopa and not the COMT inhibitor. Explosive diarrhea has been reported with tolcapone and usually necessitates discontinuing the drug. Tolcapone must also be monitored for possible liver dysfunction. This has not been reported with entacapone, and no monitoring is required. Metabolites of tolcapone and entacapone may cause discoloration of the urine. This is harmless but patients should be advised that this may occur.
