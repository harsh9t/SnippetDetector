The catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone is given in combination with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experiencing end-of-dose wearing-off. This 4-week post-marketing surveillance study was undertaken to assess patients' responses to levodopa combined with entacapone in a real clinical practice setting. Overall, 466 patients with idiopathic PD treated with levodopa and experiencing symptoms of wearing-off were recruited. Both physicians and patients recorded the response to therapy, including improvements and side-effects. Following initiation of entacapone treatment, the average daily levodopa dose was reduced from 510 to 453 mg. Physician assessment of entacapone efficacy was judged to be "very good" or "good" in 77.6% of the patients, and tolerability was considered to be "very good" or "good" in 92.4% of patients, with only 12 patients (2.6%) withdrawing from the study. Compared with baseline, there was a decrease in the mean duration of daily 'off' time from 3.0 to 1.3 h per day during the treatment period. Adverse events were in line with those previously reported, with diarrhoea being the most frequent event. The percentage of patients suffering from dyskinesia decreased from 46 to 34%, and of those patients still suffering from dyskinesia, the average daily duration of dyskinesia was reduced from 2.2 to 1.7 h. The use of adjunct dopamine agonists decreased from 67 to 59%. At study end, the percentage of patients who rated their quality of life (QoL) as "very good" or "good" increased from 12.1 to 51.7% and the percentage of patients who rated their QoL as "bad" or "very bad" decreased from 40 to 10.7%. In summary, the results of this survey conducted in real clinical practice support the findings of previous clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy and tolerability of entacapone, as well as the benefits of improved QoL, for patients achieved with entacapone.
