We present a patient who suffered from sleep attacks after starting entacapone in addition to levodopa. Entacapone, a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, alters the pharmacokinetics of levodopa, leading to increase of levodopa concentration in plasma and brain. This mechanism is suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology of sleep attacks in this case.
