Levodopa is the most efficacious agent for the treatment of motor features of Parkinson's disease but its chronic use is associated with the development of motor complications. Mounting evidence indicates the short half-life of levodopa and resultant pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors leads to wearing off, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Longer acting dopaminergic agents, such as dopamine agonists, are less likely to cause motor fluctuations and dyskinesias but are not as efficacious for control of motor symptoms. Therefore, there is interest in exploring ways to deliver levodopa in a more continuous fashion, in an effort to maintain benefit through the day and reduce the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. A dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI), such as carbidopa or benserazide, is administered with levodopa to attenuate its peripheral conversion to dopamine, reduce nausea and increase central bioavailability. When levodopa is administered with a DDCI, its main route of peripheral metabolism is via catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). A COMT inhibitor can be added to the combination of levodopa and a DDCI to further extend the levodopa peripheral half-life and increase central bioavailability. Stalevo is a combination tablet comprised of levodopa, carbidopa, and the COMT inhibitor entacapone. It is available in fixed-dose combinations of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone, 50/12.5/200, 75/18.75/200, 100/25/200, 125/31.25/200, 150/37.5/200 and 200/50/200 mg. Stalevo is currently approved for use in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose wearing off.
