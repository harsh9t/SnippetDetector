Clindamycin phosphate 1.2% together with tretinoin 0.025% as a gel (CTG) is a topical formulation of a fixed and stable combination approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age or older. The main indication of CTG is the management of moderate comedonal and mild-to-moderate papulopustular acne, an acne form which is present in more than 50% of acne patients. CTG can also be combined with systemic antiacne therapy, such as systemic isotretinoin, in nodulocystic acne. The product combines the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of clindamycin with the well proven and beneficial comedolytic and anticomedogenic effects of tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid). The addition of clindamycin to tretinoin enhances the comedolytic efficacy of tretinoin in moderate-to-severe acne of the face. The comedolytic activity of tretinoin and the anti-inflammatory efficacy of clindamycin accelerate resolution of all types of acne lesions without affecting the safety of both compounds. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events related to this formulation were found to be low (</= 1%). Safety of CTG use in pregnancy has not been established. The combination formulation is mainly designed to enhance effectiveness and minimize irritation. The once daily use of CTG, its rapid and dual effect and good tolerability have a positive impact on the duration of disease, patients' compliance and overall costs of therapy.
