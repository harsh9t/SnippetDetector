Recent evidence has demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA, or isotretinoin) is responsible for various craniofacial malformations in the rodent and human embryo. Our studies have been directed toward understanding this effect using mouse whole embryo and primary cell cultures. In whole embryo culture, 13-cis-RA caused significant overall embryonic growth retardation, especially in the primary and secondary palatal processes. In embryos explanted on day 10 of gestation and exposed for 24 or 48 hr, the mesenchyme beneath the epithelium of the nasal and maxillary processes contained pyknotic nuclei as well as a dramatically reduced number of nuclei incorporating 3H-thymidine. The secondary palatal processes and the roof of the oral-nasal cavity had fewer mesenchymal cells than control embryos. The incorporation of 3H-thymidine into TCA-insoluble macromolecules was 30% less in the retinoid-treated heads. In primary cell cultures from day-12 mouse secondary palatal mesenchyme, subsequent cell growth was decreased at concentrations of 13-cis-RA greater than 1 X 10(-5) M. After a 40-hr treatment period, labeling indices in retinoid-treated cells were significantly lower than control values (25% compared with 40%). Retinoic acid also caused a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation. The inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA on proliferation of oral-nasal mesenchymal cells appears to be related to the production of craniofacial malformations.
