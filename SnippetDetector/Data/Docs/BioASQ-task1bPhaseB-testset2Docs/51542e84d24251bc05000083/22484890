Hydroxyurea (HU) is an antimetabolic agent commonly used in myeloproliferative disorders and hematological diseases as well as in severe psoriasis. Despite of usually be well tolerated, sometimes it can induce immunosuppression and mucocutaneous adverse effects associated with discomfort or pain. Nevertheless, oral mucosal adverse reactions are extremely uncommon and present as ulcers, tongue depapilation and dyschromia. Complete remission of adverse effects is usually observed after withdrawal of the medication. The aim of this paper is to report two patients with oral lesions related to HU treatment. T0 he patients were adequately managed by changing hydroxyurea with imatinib mesilate. Oral lesions are rare complications of long-term hydroxyurea treatment and may be an indication of stopping therapy and substitution with imatinib mesilate.
