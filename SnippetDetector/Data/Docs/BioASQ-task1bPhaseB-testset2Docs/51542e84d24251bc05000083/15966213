<abstract>
Imatinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit, was used as an adjuvant chemotherapy in two patients who underwent curative surgery for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors. One patient has maintained tumor-free survival for 12 months, while the other had rapid recurrence and metastasis of tumors 3 months after he discontinued the drug. The indication and effects of imatinib for prevention of recurrence of GIST after ablative surgery were discussed.
