Autoimmune hepatitis is a disorder of unknown aetiology. Imatinib belongs to a new class of anticancer agents with high selectivity toward a specific molecular target. Its main indications are chronic myeloid leukaemia and gastrointestinal tumours. We report here, for the first time to our knowledge, imatinib mesylate-induced hepatitis with autoimmune features.
