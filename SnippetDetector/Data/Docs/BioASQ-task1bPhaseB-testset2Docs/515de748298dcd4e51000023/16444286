<abstract>
The Accreditation Subcommittee of the EBMT regularly publishes special reports on current practice of haemopoietic stem cell transplantation for haematological diseases, solid tumours and immune disorders in Europe. Major changes have occurred since the first report was published in 1996. Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation today includes grafting with allogeneic and autologous stem cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood. With reduced intensity conditioning regimens in allogeneic transplantation, the age limit has increased, permitting the inclusion of older patients. New indications have emerged such as autoimmune disorders and AL amyloidosis for autologous, and solid tumours for allogeneic transplants. The introduction of alternative therapies has challenged well-established indications such as imatinib for chronic myeloid leukaemia. An updated report with revised tables and operating definitions is presented here.
