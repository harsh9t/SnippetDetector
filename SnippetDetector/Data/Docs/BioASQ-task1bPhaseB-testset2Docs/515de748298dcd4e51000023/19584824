The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation regularly publishes special reports on the current practice of haematopoietic SCT for haematological diseases, solid tumours and immune disorders in Europe. Major changes have occurred since the first report was published. HSCT today includes grafting with allogeneic and autologous stem cells derived from BM, peripheral blood and cord blood. With reduced-intensity conditioning regimens in allogeneic transplantation, the age limit has increased, permitting the inclusion of older patients. New indications have emerged, such as autoimmune disorders and AL amyloidosis for autologous HSCT and solid tumours, myeloproliferative syndromes and specific subgroups of lymphomas for allogeneic transplants. The introduction of alternative therapies, such as imatinib for CML, has challenged well-established indications. An updated report with revised tables and operating definitions is presented.
