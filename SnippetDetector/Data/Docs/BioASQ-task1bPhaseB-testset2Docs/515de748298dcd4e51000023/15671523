UNLABELLED: Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals East Manruer, NJ) received accelerated approval on May 10, 2001 for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in (a) chronic phase after failure of IFN-alpha therapy, (b) accelerated phase, and (c) blast crisis. The accelerated approval was accompanied by a postmarketing commitment by Novartis Pharmaceuticals to continue patient follow-up to determine duration of treatment response and survival. The present review, based on a safety and efficacy report submitted on December 20, 2002, summarizes data applicable to the conversion of these three CML indications to full approval status. RESULTS: Chronic phase CML: Five hundred thirty-two chronic phase CML patients who had not benefited from prior IFN therapy were treated at a starting imatinib mesylate dose of 400 mg p.o. qd; dose escalation to 800 mg p.o. qd was allowed. Patients had received a median of 14 months of IFN therapy at doses > or =25 million IU/wk and were all in late chronic phase, with a median time from diagnosis of 32 months. Median duration of imatinib mesylate treatment was 29 months, with 81% of patients treated for > or =24 months (maximum 31.5 months). Initial favorable treatment responses were sustained. An estimated 87.8% of patients who had a major cytogenetic response maintained their response 2 years after their initial response. After 2 years of treatment, an estimated 85.4% of patients were free of progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis, and the estimated overall survival was 90.8% (95% confidence interval, 88.3-93.2). Accelerated phase CML: Patients enrolled totaled 293: 235 with CML accelerated phase, 48 with relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia, 2 with relapsed/refractory acute myelocytic leukemia, and 8 with relapsed/refractory CML in lymphoid blast crisis. Patients received imatinib mesylate 400 or 600 mg p.o. qd. Dose escalation was permitted, to a maximum of 800 mg/d, taken as 400 mg bid. Efficacy results were improved in patients receiving imatinib mesylate 600 mg qd versus patients receiving 400 mg qd. The median duration of hematologic response was 29 versus 17 months and the estimated 24-month maintained hematologic response rate was 61% versus 42%. The median survival of patients treated with imatinib mesylate 600 mg qd was not reached versus 20.9 months for patients receiving 400 mg qd. Estimated 24-month survival rate was 66% versus 46%. The median survival in the advanced leukemia population (acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, and lymphoid blast crisis) was only 5 months, and only two patients are still on treatment. Blast crisis CML: A total of 260 patients were recruited. The imatinib mesylate dose was initially 400 mg qd (37 patients) but was subsequently increased to 600 mg qd (223 patients). Patients receiving imatinib mesylate 600 mg qd had a higher hematologic response rate than did patients receiving 400 mg (33% versus 16%). Major cytogenetic responses occurred in 15% of the 260 study patients. The overall median survival was 6.9 months: 7.1 months for patients treated with imatinib mesylate 600 mg and 4.7 months for patients receiving imatinib mesylate 400 mg. Estimated 12-month survival rate for all study patients was 32.1% and estimated 24-month survival rate was 18.3%. SAFETY: Imatinib mesylate was generally well tolerated, but relatively frequent reports of common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were encountered. The most frequently reported adverse events included gastrointestinal disturbances, edema, rash, and musculoskeletal complaints. These rarely led to discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm those of the interim analysis and suggest that imatinib mesylate represents an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase after failure of IFN-alpha therapy, in blast crisis, and in accelerated phase.
