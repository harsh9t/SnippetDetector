BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke subtypes and prognosis differ among older black patients compared with whites; however, few data are available regarding stroke among young black patients. METHODS: To determine the risk factors for stroke, stroke subtype, and prognosis among young black patients, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all 15- to 44-year-old patients admitted with stroke to a university-affiliated public hospital from January 1990 through June 1994. RESULTS: Of the 248 eligible patients admitted with stroke, 219 were blacks. Hypertension was more frequently associated with stroke in young black than in non-black patients (55% versus 24%, P = .003). Cocaine abuse was frequent among both black and non-black patients (27% versus 38%, P = NS). Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (64%) was the most common subtype of intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 67), and lacunar infarction (21%) was the most common subtype of cerebral infarction (n = 112) in young black patients. Outcome in black patients with stroke at discharge was 69% independent, 8% dependent, and 23% dead. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of hypertension, hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and lacunar infarction among young black patients with stroke suggests accelerated hypertensive arteriolar damage, possibly due to poor control of hypertension.
