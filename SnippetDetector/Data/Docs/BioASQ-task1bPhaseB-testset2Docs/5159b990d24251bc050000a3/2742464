With the current epidemic of cocaine abuse, there have been many clinical reports of cocaine toxicity, including stroke. Autopsy findings were reported in only one case of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse. We describe the autopsy toxicological findings in a case of sudden death in a young person due to intracerebral hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse. In view of the present epidemic of cocaine abuse, cocaine toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage. We suggest that the pharmacodynamic effects of cocaine on the cerebral vasculature is the most likely cause.
