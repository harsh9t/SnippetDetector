<abstract>
We analyzed 26 autopsy cases of cocaine induced intracerebral hemorrhage and compared those findings with those of 26 autopsy cases of cocaine induced cerebral aneurysm rupture. The incidence of hypertensive cardiovascular disease (HCVD) was significantly higher in persons with intracerebral hemorrhage than in those with aneurysm rupture. Our findings suggest that HCVD predisposes to cocaine induced intracerebral hemorrhage. We propose that the foregoing relationship results from a cocaine induced alteration of cerebral autoregulation in the context of increased cerebral blood flow.
