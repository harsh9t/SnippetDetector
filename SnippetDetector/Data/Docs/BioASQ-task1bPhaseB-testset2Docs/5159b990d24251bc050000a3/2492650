An increase in cocaine abuse by pregnant women has been associated with a range of maternal/fetal cardiovascular complications. Intracerebral hemorrhage has been reported as a cocaine-related complication, but has not previously been associated with pregnancy. We report a case of cocaine-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the postpartum period which complicated the differential diagnosis and management of hypertension and seizures.
