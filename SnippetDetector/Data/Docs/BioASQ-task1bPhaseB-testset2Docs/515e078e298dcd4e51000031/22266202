The INSURE method, which consists of an intubation-surfactant-extubation sequence, is effective in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), the duration of respiratory support, and the need for surfactant replacement in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Although beneficial, the INSURE method fails to avoid MV in selected patients. We demonstrated that body weight <750 g, pO(2)/FiO(2) <218, and a/ApO(2) <0.44 at the first blood gas analysis are independent risk factors for INSURE failure in infants with gestational age <30 weeks. Moreover, we demonstrated that the INSURE treatment can be safely repeated with the aim to avoid MV, since the respiratory outcome did not differ between infants treated with single or multiple INSURE procedures.
