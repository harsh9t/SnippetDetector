Therapeutic hypothermia is a recognized treatment for term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities. Little is known about applications of this treatment to preterm newborns. Studies in animal experimental models demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia in preterm fetuses but clinical application to newborn infants are limited to restricted cases, as severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We present a case of therapeutic whole body cooling in a baby at 34 weeks and 6 days of gestational age with HIE.
