Introduction
ymmetrical methylation of  at position 5 of cytosine within a p. G dinucleotide is a major epigenetic modification (β�Ό5% of the total cytosine in the mammalian genome) although a small amount of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) generated from 5-meC by a methylcytosine dioxygenase has recently been detected in certain cell types [1]β€“[3]. Very recently it has been shown that cytosine methylation at nonCpG sites, although rare, is involved in gene silencing in mammals [4]. DNA methylation is essential for mammalian development. DNA hypermethylation suppresses spurious promoters located within the repeat elements and proviruses in mammalian genome whereas hypomethylation induces genomic instability [5], [6]. DNA methylation is also involved in the regulation of genomic imprinting, inactivation of the silent X chromosome in females and expression of certain tissue specific genes [1], [6]. In humans, alterations in genomic methylation patterns are linked to imprinting disorders and other human diseases including cancer [7]β€“[9].
Although CpG is usually underrepresented in much of the genome, short (500β€“2000 bp long) CpG regions, designated CpG islands (CGI), are predominantly located in the proximal promoter regions of almost 50% of the mammalian genes. These regions are usually methylation free in normal cells with the exception of imprinted alleles and genes on the inactive X chromosome. Recent high throughput genome wide DNA methylation analysis identified many more CGIs located distal to promoters that are tissue-specifically methylated [5]. Furthermore, methylation also occurs in the coding regions of active genes and reversible DNA methylation can regulate gene expression in response to stimuli such as estrogen treatment and membrane depolarization [6].
DNA methylation in mammalian cells is established and maintained by DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (DNMTs). Methylation is initiated by highly homologous DNMT3A and DNMT3B that prefer unmethylated DNA as the substrate [1], [10]. DNA methylation is heritably propagated by DNMT1 that prefers hemimethylated DNA as substrate. All three DNMTs are essential for development in mammals [11], [12]. Among these three enzymes, DNMT3B is directly linked to different diseases. For example, mutation of the DNMT3B gene causes immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a rare human disorder due to alteration in the methylation of minor satellite repeats [13] and genes regulating immune function and neuronal development [14]. Thus, DNMT3B deficiency in these patients cannot be compensated by other DNMTs. Studies in mutant mice have shown that DNMT3A and DNMT3B methylate distinct as well as overlapping regions of the genome [12]. For example, DNMT3A2 catalyzes methylation of imprinted genes in germ cells whereas tandem repeat elements are methylated by both DNMT3A and DNMT3B [2]. DNMT3B has also been linked to type 2 diabetes by regulating mitochondrial DNA copy numbers through fatty acid-induced non-CpG methylation of PGC-1Ξ± [4]. Emerging studies have shown that a variety of cofactors specifically target DNMTs to distinct chromosomal regions in vivo [15], as these enzymes demonstrate specificity only towards CpG base pairs in vitro [2]. Gene silencing by DNMTs occurs predominantly by recruitment of repressors that include methyl CpG binding proteins (MBDs) and co-repressors such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) and histone methyltransferases (HMT), resulting in distortion of local chromatin structure [3], [9], [16].
Hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs) is a common epigenetic event in almost all malignancies [7], [9]. Upregulation of DNMT3B is also a characteristic of many cancer cells [17]. For example, in sporadic breast carcinoma, 30% of the patients showed increased expression of DNMT3B compared to minimal increase (3β€“5%) in DNMT1 and DNMT3A [18]. Significantly higher expression of DNMT3B was observed in acute myeloid leukemia compared to normal myeloid cells [19]. DNMT3B overexpression was associated with high tumor grade and CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) in colon cancer [17]. Furthermore, depletion of DNMT3B, but not DNMT3A, induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cells [20]. It has also been reported that upregulation of DNMT3B is more dramatic and more frequent than DNMT1 and DNMT3A in cancers including bladder and colon [21]. Studies in a mouse model have shown that the overexpression of Dnmt3b but not Dnmt3a promoted colon tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice [22]. These observations suggest that DNMT3B may play a causal role in tumorigenesis.
Different groups have identified methylation targets using different techniques [14], [22], in the present study we have identified direct DNMT3B target genes in colon cancer cells by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by CpG island microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip). Many DNMT3B targets are embedded in CpG islands and some are known tumor suppressors. We also report the methylation status of some of these genes with potential growth suppressor properties in primary colorectal tumors and colon cancer cell lines. Further, we examined tumor suppressive characteristics of two important transcription factors, HOXB13 and TBX18, in colon cancer cells.

Methods
ice. Nude mice were purchased from Jackson laboratory. All mice were housed, handled, and euthanized in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines under the supervision of the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All animals used in this study were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/or local animal welfare bodies.Cell culture, treatment with 5-aza-2β€²-deoxy-cytidine (decitabine) and isolation of DNAHuman colon cancer cell lines (RKO, HCT116, SW480, SW837, Colo205, CaCo2 and DLD1b) and normal colon cell line (CCD841) were obtained from ATCC and grown in media as suggested by ATCC. RKO and HCT116 cells were treated with decitabine (0.1 to 5 ΒµM) for 24β€“120 hours. The wild type, DNMT1β�’/β�’, DNMT3Bβ�’/β�’ and DKO (DNMT1β�’/β�’ DNMT3Bβ�’/β�’) cells (a generous gift from Bert Vogelstein) were cultured as described [23].Western blot analysisAffinity purified antibodies against DNMT3A and DNMT3B were used for western blot analysis as described [24], [25]. Anti-Flag antibody was from Sigma.Primary Human TumorsThe tumor samples were obtained from patients at James Cancer Hospital (The Ohio State University). Complete pathologic classification is available for all tumor samples studied. All tissues used for this study were part of an institutional review board-approved protocol at the Ohio State University College of Medicine.ChIP on Chip assayChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described [26] with some modifications. ChIP was performed on formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin (DNA fragmented to β�Ό600 bp to 3000 bp by sonication) from 108 RKO cells with antibody against DNMT3B [26], [27]. The anti-DNMT3B antibodies raised in our laboratory do not cross react with each other or with DNMT1 [28]. We used affinity purified DNMT3B antibodies to pull down DNA from formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin prepared from RKO cells. The chromatin was cleared with pre-immune IgG and protein A beads. The precipitated DNA was dissolved in RIPA buffer and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with the same antibody to minimize pull down of false positive targets. This DNA was then separated on an agarose gel and DNA from 0.5 to 3 kb in size was purified by using Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), labeled with Cy5-labeled dNTP and hybridized to a CpG island library coated on glass slides [29], [30]. The same amount of input DNA and DNA precipitated with preimmune-IgG) was used as control. We selected only those genes for sequence analysis where the signal in ChIP DNA was β‰¥2 fold compared to the control rabbit IgG signal. MIAME complaint data has been submitted to Geo database (accession number GSE18929).Sequence analysis of clonesThe construction of CpG island library has been described earlier [29]. The clones pulled own by DNMT3B antibodies were picked up from the CpG island library and sequenced in an automated sequencer.RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR analysisRNA was isolated using guanidinium thiocyanate-acid phenol method, treated with DNase 1 to remove residual DNA, if any, and reverse transcribed using random hexamers following standard protocol. Real time RT-PCR was done using SYBR Green technology following published protocol [27], [31]. RT-PCR primers will be available upon request.ChIP-CHOP analysis was performed as described [32]Primer sequences are provided in the Table S1.COBRA (Combined bisulfite-restriction analysis)COBRA of genomic DNA was performed as described [33], [34]. CGIs different genes were amplified with primers specific for bisulfite converted DNA where unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracils. Primers were designed using Methprimer software (http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/index1.html). Primer sequences are provided in the Table S1.Quantitative DNA methylation analysis of HOXB13 CGI by MassARRAYDNA methylation analyses were carried out using the EpiTYPER application (Sequenom, San Diego) as described [35]. Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated, subjected to integrity control and subjected to bisulfite treatment. Regions of interest were amplified using primers for bisulfite treated DNA (primer sequences available upon request), amplified DNA was transcribed in vitro and cleaved using RNAse A. The molecular weight of the resulting fragments indicative of the DNA methylation state was analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. DNA methylation standards (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%) were used to control for PCR amplification bias. Equation fitting algorithms based on the R statistical computing environment were used for data correction. Display of methylation results as heat maps and unsupervised clustering were performed using the Multiple Experimental Viewer software (http://www.tm4.org/mev.html).Cloning of HOXB13 and TBX18 cDNA and generation of RKO and HCT116 cell lines overexpressing these proteinscDNA derived from total RNA from normal human colon (Clontech) was amplified with primers specific for HOXB13 and TBX18 coding region and cloned into pcDNA-3XFlag (Sigma). The authenticity of the cDNAs was confirmed by sequencing. The Flag-tagged cDNAs were then cloned into pBabe-puro and infectious retroviruses were generated in phoenix cells. Stable cell lines (RKO, HCT116 or DLD1b) overexpressing HOXB13 or TBX18 were generated by infecting these cells with the recombinant retroviruses and selected with puromycin.Clonogenic survival was performed as described [36]Cell growth was measured by MTT assay as described[37]Tumor growth in nude mice was performed as described [38]HOXB13 promoter activity assayHOXB13 promoter regions spanning β�’1.2 kb to +0.2 kb and β�’5.2 kb to +0.2 kb with respect to transcription start site (TSS) were amplified from lymphocyte DNA using Accuprime polymerase, confirmed by sequencing, and cloned into pGL3 basic (firefly luciferase vector). These promoter reporter plasmids along with pRLTK (renilla luciferase vector) were transfected into RKO cells and luciferase activity was measured using Dual luciferase assay kit (Promega).

Results
h. IP on Chip analysis identified DNMT3B target genes in RKO, a colon cancer cell lineAberrant DNA methylation is prevalent in colorectal carcinogenesis [39]β€“[41]. To identify hypermethylated genes in colon cancer (RKO) cells we performed ChIP with anti-DNMT3B followed by CpG island (CGI) microarray. We selected DNMT3B because its expression is significantly higher than DNMT3A and DNMT1 in RKO cells (Figure 1A) and it appears to play a causal role in colon tumorigenesis [22]. The specificity of the affinity purified DNMT3B antibody was confirmed by using extracts from DNMT3B null HCT cells. A major (β�Ό98/96 kDa) polypeptide was detected by this antibody in RKO cells, in the wild type and DNMT1β�’/β�’ HCT cells. That these polypeptides are different variants of DNMT3B was confirmed by the inability of the antibody to detect any protein in DNMT3Bβ�’/β�’ and DKO (DNMT1β�’/β�’ DNMT3Bβ�’/) cells. A few very minor polypeptides detected in cells expressing DNMT3B are probably its isoforms because it is known that DNMT3B exhibits different spliced variants [42]. To reduce nonspecific pull down, ChIP was performed twice with the same antibody and the precipitated DNA was resolved on an agarose gel to elute DNA of smaller sizes (0.5 to 3 kb) as probe for CpG island microarray (see Methods for detail) (Figure 1B).10.1371/journal.pone.0010338.g001Figure 1Expression of DNMT3B is higher in RKO cells.A. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts from RKO and HCT (wild type and mutant) cells with antibodies specific for DNMTs. Affinity purified antibodies against DNMT3B were used for immunoblotting. B. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of DNMTs in RKO cells was performed using SYBR Green method. Data are mean of triplicate assays. Single and double asterisks denote p values β‰¤0.05 and β‰¤0.01, respectively. C. Ethidium bromide staining of DNA immunoprecipitated by DNMT3B antibody and input DNA that were used for CpG island microarray analysis.Next, we sequenced only those pulled-down genes that were at least 2 fold enriched in ChIP DNA compared to that pulled down by control rabbit IgG. The microarray data has been submitted to Geo database and it is MIAME complaint (accession number GSE18929). We classified these genes into four groups, i) genes with CpG island (CGI) but without repeat elements, ii) genes without CGI and repeat elements, iii) repeat elements, and iv) genomic contigs associated with repeat elements (Table 1 and Table S2). Among the genes with CGIs, there are some known tumor suppressors, such as P16/MTS1, DDC, PGRMC1, CAVEOLIN1 and some disease susceptibility genes such as DISC1 (disrupted in Schizophrenia 1) [43], TBX5 (Congenital heart failure or Holt-Oram syndrome) [44] (Table 1). We also identified a few novel genes such as TBX18, DGKI, SLIT1 and GNA11 as DNMT3B targets.10.1371/journal.pone.0010338.t001Table 1Methylted DNMT3B Target Genes in RKO cells identified by ChIP on Chip.Accession #Gene nameGene symbolGROUP I: Genes harboring CpG island without repeat elementsNM_018662disrupted in schizophrenia 1DISC1NM_003522histone cluster 1, H2bfHIST1H2BFNM_001080508T-box 18TBX18NM_001753Caveolin-1CAVEOLIN1NM_004717diacylglycerol kinase iotaDGKIU26727P16INK4/MTS1CDKN2ANM_021951doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1DMRT1NM_003692transmembrane protein with EGF-like and two follistatin-like domains 1TMEFF1NM_003061Slit-1SLIT1NM_018362lin-7 homolog C (C. elegans)LIN7CAF532858Nogo-66 receptor homolog-1NGRH1/RTN4RL2BC031869M.m.

Formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin from RKO cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-DNMT3B or pre-immune IgG. DNA pulled down was divided into three aliquots, which were either undigested or digested with Hpa II, Msp I and subjected to PCR with primers specific for CGIs of different genes that harbor Hpa II/Msp I sites. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Generation of PCR product in Hpa II digested DNA indicates methylation.To confirm the association of DNMT3B with some of its putative target genes, we amplified their promoter regions from a different batch of chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA. We performed ChIP-CHOP analysis to determine methylation status of the target DNA. For this assay, the immunoprecipated DNA was divided into three identical aliquots for mock-digestion, digestion with Hpa II (methylation sensitive enzyme) or Msp I (methylation insensitive enzyme) (see Figure 2A for a schematic diagram). The digested DNA was then used to amplify the promoter of interest using primers that encompass one or more Hpa II/Msp I sites. Amplification of the promoter region from the mock-digested DNA indicates that the gene of interest is a target of DNMT3B whereas generation of Hpa II resistant PCR product demonstrates that the gene is methylated. PCR products are not obtained from Msp I digested DNA since Msp I digestion is not sensitive to methylation. Thus, ChIP-CHOP assay not only reveals association of a gene with a certain protein but also identifies the methylation status of the associated promoter at Hpa II sites. The data presented in Figure 2B demonstrated that some of the DNMT3B target genes such as P16, TBX5, TBX18, GNA11, DMRT1, HOXB13, CAVEOLIN1, PGRMC1, DCC, DGKi, CDH26, LIN7C, ZBTB3, DISC1 and the histone H2B variant (H2Bf) are methylated in RKO cells. Notably, TBX-18, HOXB13, DMRT1, DISC1, H2Bf and LIN7C CGIs are partially methylated in RKO cells at least at the Hpa II sites (as demonstrated by increased PCR product in mock-digested DNA than in Hpa II cleaved DNA) and DNMT3B is associated with these CGIs irrespective of their methylation status. In contrast, DNMT3B is predominantly associated with methylated CGIs of P16, TBX5, DCC and PGRMC1. None of these target genes could be amplified from chromatin immunoprecipitated with control rabbit IgG (data shown for only TBX5) (Fig. 2B) demonstrating that these are specific DNMT3B targets. Lack of amplification of GAPDH promoter, a house keeping gene, from RKO genomic DNA indicates that GAPDH CGI is methylation free and Hpa II digestion was complete. GAPDH was not pulled down by DNMT3B (data not shown).10.1371/journal.pone.0010338.g002Figure 2ChIP-CHOP assay to demonstrate association of DNMT3A and DNMT3B with the selected target genes.A. Schematic diagram of ChIP-CHOP assay. B. Formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin from RKO cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-DNMT3B or pre-immune IgG. DNAs pulled down were divided into three aliquots, which were either undigested or digested with Hpa II, Msp I and subjected to PCR with primers specific for CGIs of different genes that harbor Hpa II/Msp I sites. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Generation of PCR product in Hpa II digested DNA indicates methylation. U, H and M indicate PCR products obtained in mock-, Hpa II- digested and Msp I-digested DNA, respectively. Lack of PCR product with Msp I digested DNA confirmed complete digestion. C. Activation of several DNMT3B target genes in RKO cells after treatment with decitabine. RKO cells were treated with the drug for the indicate time periods. RNA from these cells was subjected to RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. Three hundred ng of cDNA for the test gene and 1 ng of cDNA were used for 18S rRNA.Next, we tested methylation status of a few genes in other colon cancer cell lines (DLD1b, HCT116, SW480, CACo2, COLO205, SW837) by digestion of their genomic DNA with Hpa II/Msp I followed by PCR with gene specific primers. While TBX5 and DCC are methylated in all cell lines, other genes (TBX18, DGKI, PGRMC1, LIN7C and HOXB13) are differentially methylated (Table S3). It is noteworthy that none of these genes are methylated in normal colon epithelial cells CCD841.Treatment of RKO cells with decitabine resulted in activation of the methylated genesTo determine whether methylation of some of the DNMT3B target genes indeed suppressed their expression in RKO cells, we treated these cells with the commonly used DNA hypomethylating agent, 5-aza-2β€²-deoxycytidine. RNA isolated from untreated and the inhibitor (1 and 2.5 ΒµM) treated RKO cells harvested at 24, 48 or 72 hours was subjected to RT-PCR analysis with gene specific primers. TBX18, DCC and CAVEOLIN 1 were re-expressed in RKO cells treated with 1 and 2.5 ΒµM decitabine as early as 24 hr and their expression persisted up to 72 hr (Figure 2B). In contrast, SLIT1 was induced at a very low level under these conditions whereas HOXB13 was reactivated only after exposure to the drug for 72 hr. On the contrary, GNA11 was expressed at high level in RKO cells indicating that the methylation of CGI located in intron 1 of this gene did not affect its expression.CGIs of DNMT3B target genes are methylated in human primary colorectal tumorsNext, we extended our study to analyze the methylation status of a selected group of genes (DCC, TBX18, TBX5, SLIT1 and GNA11) in several primary human colorectal tumors and matching normal colon tissues by COBRA. The methylation status of these genes in a few pairs is presented in Figure 3. The CGI spanning promoter/exon 1 of DCC was methylated at Taq I site in 8 out of 10 tumors as demonstrated by almost complete digestion with Taq I whereas it was methylated in matching normal colon tissues only in sample #8 and #10 (Figure 3.i). Similarly, CGI of TBX18 was methylated at the BstU I site in 6 out of 7 tumors without significant methylation in matching normals (Figure 3.ii). TBX5 encodes 4 transcript variants that are generated by alternate transcription initiation sites and alternative splicing. We analyzed methylation status of CGIs spanning the promoter/exon 1 of variants 1 and 3 (TBX5L) and variant 4 (TBX5S) (Figure 3.iii). Interestingly, CGI of TBX5L was methylated at Taq I sites both in normal colon tissues and tumors but methylation was more pronounced in 3 out of 5 tumors (#1, 4 & 6) than in the matching normals. In contrast, CGI of TBX5S was specifically methylated in tumors in 5 out of 6 samples at the BstU I site. Thus, two CGIs located in close proximity demonstrated differential methylation status in the same sample at least with respect to Taq I and BstU I sites. CGI spanning promoter/exon 1 of SLIT1 was tumor-specifically methylated at the Taq I site in 5 out of 10 samples analyzed (Figure 3.iv). Notably CGI located in the intron of GNA11 was completely methylated both in normals and tumors as demonstrated by complete digestion of the PCR product with BstU I (Figure 3.v). Methylation at this intronic CGI did not silence GNA11 as demonstrated by its robust expression in RKO cells (Figure 2c). Complete bisulfite conversion was demonstrated by digestion of the amplicons with methylation insensitive Mse I or Tsp509 I (data not shown). These COBRA data showed that some of DNMT3B targets were hypermethylated in primary colorectal tumors albeit at different levels. However, we did not observe methylation of CGI located in the promoter as well as exon 1 region of the HOXB13 gene in primary colon cancer by COBRA (data not shown).10.1371/journal.pone.0010338.g003Figure 3Analysis of methylation status of CGI of selected genes by COBRA in primary human colorectal tumors.Location of the CGI of each gene as appeared in UCSC genome browser is depicted in the accompanied schematic diagrams. Bisulfite converted genomic DNA was amplified with gene specific primers followed by digestion with a methylation sensitive enzyme Taq I or BstU I. T and N denote tumor and matching normal, respectively. Sample numbers shown in red identify tumors with gene-specific methylation.CGI located 4.5 kb upstream of HOXB13 Transcription start site (TSS) is hypermethylated in colorectal tumorsAlthough COBRA did not reveal methylation of CGI located in the promoter and exon 1 region, HOXB13 gene was reactivated after treatment with decitabine (Figure 2C). This observation suggested that methylation of a CGI located at a different region of the gene or specific CpGs within the promoter region might regulate its expression in colon cancer cells or tissues. BLAT analysis identified two CGIs in human HOXB13 gene, one in the promoter/exon1 and the other β�Ό4.5 kb upstream of transcription start site (TSS) (Figure 4A). We, therefore, analyzed methylation status of CpGs spanning the promoter and upstream CGI (Figure 4B, and Tables S4 and S5) in primary colorectal tumors and in cell lines by MassARRAY because in this mass spectrometry based assay methylation status of CpGs can be estimated quantitatively. It is evident from the HEAT map that methylation at the upstream CGI is higher in tumors than in normals (Figure 4C.i). Quantification of the results showed that overall methylation density at the upstream CGIs was significantly higher (Pβ€�=β€�0.02) in tumors compared to the normals (Figure 4C.ii). In contrast, CGI in the promoter region was essentially methylation free (Figure 4C.i), which correlated with the COBRA data (data not shown). MassARRAY analysis of colon cancer cell lines revealed hypermethylation at the upstream CGI in HCT, CaCo2 and RKO cells whereas relatively low level methylation was detected in RWPE and SW837 cells. Notably, CCD841, a normal colon epithelial cell line, was essentially unmethylated. Selective methylation of the upstream CGI but not the one located in the immediate upstream promoter region occurs in colon cancer cells probably due to distinct chromatin structure that is accessible to DNMTs.10.1371/journal.pone.0010338.g004Figure 4Methylation of the CpGs spanning upstream and promoter regions of HOXB13 gene in primary colorectal tumors and colon cancer cell lines by MassARRAY.A and B. Potential methylatable CpGs in these regions are shown after bisulfite conversion. CpGs sequenced by MassARRAY are boxed and numbered. It is notable that this technique provides average methylation status of CpGs that are in close proximity (numbered together as 1, 2 etc). Gray bars indicate samples that could not be sequenced. C.i. HEAT map of methylation profile of CpGs located within upstream CGI and promoter (TSS) region. The same amplicon of methylation density ranging from 0 to 100% was used to generate standard curve. C.ii. Box plot of quantitative analysis of methylation density in the upstream CGI and promoter regions in primary colorectal tumors and normals. Significance was assessed by Welch test (adaptation of t test, parametric, unequal variance, one-tailed). D. Upstream region (β�’5.4 kb) activates HOXB13 promoter activity in colon cancer cells. HOXB13 promoter regions (β�’1.2 kb and β�’5.4 kb) cloned into pGL3 basic vector (RLU1) were transfected into HCT116 cells along with internal control pRLTK (RLU2), followed by treatment with 10 nM estradiol (E) in phenol red free medium containing 5% charcoal stripped serum for different time periods. E. Only the upstream CGI is methylated in HCT cells, which undergoes site-specific and global demethylation by DNMT1 alone and both DNMT1, DNMT3B, respectively. i) MassARRAY, ii) real-time RT-PCR analysis of HOXB13, and iii) RT-PCR analysis of ERΞ± and GAPDH.To investigate the role of the upstream CGI in HOXB13 expression we generated luciferase reporter constructs harboring β�’5.4 kb to +0.2 kb and β�’1.2 kb to +0.2 kb regions, respectively into pGL3basic vector and compared their ability to modulate firefly luciferase activity at 36 and 48 hr post transfection in HCT116 cells, because these cells can be transfected with high efficiency. The luciferase activity driven by β�’5.4 kb promoter was at least 2 fold higher than that contributed by β�’1.2 kb region (Figure 4D). Promoterless pGL3basic showed minimal activity (data not shown). Since HOXB13 is an estrogen responsive gene [45], we also measured activity of these two promoter regions by treating cells with estrogen 24 hr post-transfection with estradiol that increased the activity of both promoters at 12 and 24 hrs (Figure 4D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the upstream promoter region of HOXB13 gene stimulated promoter activity but did not contribute to estrogen responsiveness.To identify the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) that catalyzes methylation of HOXB13, we measured its methylation status in the wild type and mutant HCT cell lines lacking DNMT1, DNMT3B or both. Massarray analysis showed that the upstream CGI is heavily methylated in the wild type and DNMT3Bβ�’/β�’ cells but is significantly hypomethylated at certain CpGs in DNMT1β�’/β�’ cells and almost completely in double knock out (DKO) cells (Figure 4E and Tables S4 and S5). These results indicate that although DNMT1 alone can methylate certain CpGs, its cooperation with DNMT3B is required for efficient methylation of the upstream CGI. Notably, promoter CGI is not methylated in any of these 4 cell lines. Surprisingly, HOXB13 expression is upregulated only in DNMT1β�’/β�’ cells compared to the wild type cells (Figure 4E). Significant downregulation of ERΞ± (Figure 4E), an activator of HOXB13 [45] probably accounts for HOXB13 suppression in DNMT3Bβ�’/β�’ and DKO cells. Increase in HOXB13 expression in DNMT1β�’/β�’ cells suggests that methylation at certain CpGs in the upstream CGI suppresses HOXB13 expression. Thus, the upstream CGI probably functions as an enhancer and its methylation partially suppresses but does not silence HOXB13 expression.Ectopic expression of TBX18 and HOXB13 inhibits growth, clonogenic survival and anchorage independent growth of colon cancer cellsWe next explored the anti-tumorigenic properties of TBX18 and HOXB13 in colon cancer cells. TBX18, a member of T-box family of transcription factor, is expressed in the segmented somites and in the limb bud [46]. TBX18 knock out mice die immediately after birth due to severe defects in organs deriving from the lateral sclerotome [47]. In contrast, ubiquitously expressed HOXB13 is a member of homeobox super family involved in establishing cell fate during embryonic development and maintaining differentiation state in adults [48], [49]. HOXB13 is upregulated in many solid tumors including cancers of the endometrium, cervix, ovary and prostate whereas it is down regulated in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma and colon cancer [45]. To study the potential role of HOXB13 and TBX18 in modulating tumorigenic property of colon cancer cells we expressed these proteins using retroviral vector (pBabe) in the nonexpressing colon cancer cell lines RKO and DLD1b. Ectopic expression of the proteins was measured in puromycin-selected cells by Western blot analysis with anti-Flag antibody (Figure 5A). The growth rates of TBX18 and HOXB13 expressing versus nonexpressing cells were assessed by MTT assay. Overexpression of these proteins resulted in a significant decrease in the growth rate of the cells compared to vector starting from day 1 in both cell lines (Figure 5B), which correlated with dramatic reduction in replication potential in RKO cells expressing TBX18 or HOXB13 compared to vector transfected cells (Figure 5C). Similarly, clonogenic survival of RKO cells expressing these transcription factors was significantly reduced (Figure 5D). Ectopic expression of HOXB13 and TBX18 in another nonexpressing cell line, DLD1b inhibited these properties (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrated that TBX18 and HOXB13 severely compromised tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells in vitro.10.1371/journal.pone.0010338.g005Figure 5HOXB13 and TBX18 demonstrate anti-tumorignic property in colon cancer cells in vitro.A.

For this purpose, RKO cells expressing either HOXB13 or TBX18 and vector transfected cells were injected into the flanks of nude mice. Mice were monitored for tumor growth every week and tumor size was measured. Tumor growth was visible as early as one week in mice injected with the control and TBX18 expressing cells. In contrast, the tumor was not detectable in most of the animals injected with HOXB13 expressing cells (Figure 6A). At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed, tumors were removed and their weights and volumes were determined. Notably, HOXB13 expressing cells could not form tumors in majority of animals (Figure 6B, C). These cells formed only two visible tumors in mice. Surprisingly, no significant change in tumor growth in RKO cells expressing TBX18 was observed. Western blot analysis with anti-Flag antibody to detect ectopic TBX18 showed that the tumors developed nude mice expressed TBX18 (Figure 6D) suggesting that lack of inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice was not due to loss of TBX18 expression. It is likely that some host factor(s) in the tumor microenvironment antagonizes the tumor suppressor function of TBX18 in nude mice. Similar results were observed in HCT116 and DLD1b cells (data no shown). Thus, HOXB13 functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer cells both in vitro and ex vivo.10.1371/journal.pone.0010338.g006Figure 6HOXB13 but not TBX18 inhibited ability of RKO cells to form tumor in nude mice.One million cells in PBS (100 Βµl) were injected into the flanks of nude mice and tumor size was monitored every week using a caliper.

Discussion
t is now well established that hypermethylation is a common mechanism for silencing tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. ecause re-expression of these genes upon demethylation was perceived to be an alternate strategy for cancer therapy, considerable effort has been expended to identify novel tumor suppressor genes in specific cancer types that are silenced by methylation. linical trials of idaza and acogen against different cancers underscore the significance of epigenetic therapy in cancer [50], [51]. urther, differentially methylated genes could be potential biomarkers for colorectal cancer. ndeed, recent studies have shown that some of the hypermethylated genes could be detected in the stool of colon cancer patients [41], [52].
 methyltransferases, expressed at relatively low levels in somatic cells, are frequently upregulated in cancer cells. ain of function studies have shown that nmt3b but not nmt3a promotes colon tumorigenesis in in/+ mice by inducing de novo methylation of multiple genes harboring p. G islands [22]. It, therefore, becomes important to identify the targets of DNMT3B in colon cancer cells to understand its function in tumorigenesis. A recent study has used expression profiling to identify its targets in colon cancer cell lines [53]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report on the identification of direct DNMT3B targets in colon cancer cells using ChIP-on-chip with antibodies that are specific for DNMT3B. The targets identified include not only well known tumor suppressors such as P16/INK4A, DCC, CAVEOLIN1, PGRMC1 but also novel genes like TBX18, TBX5, SLIT1, DGKI. Activation of some of these genes after treatment with demethylating agents confirmed that methylation indeed silenced their expression in colon cancer cells. DNMT1 and DNMT3B function co-operatively to methylate and silence many tumor suppressor genes in colon cancer cells [23]. It is, therefore, conceivable that both enzymes could act in concert to alter methylation status of the target genes, as observed in HOXB13 upstream CGI (Figure 4E).
An important observation is that a validated set of genes (TBX5, DCC, DGKI, CDH26, HOXB13, CAVEOLIN1, PGRMC1, GNA11, TBX18, ZBTB3 and DMRT1) are indeed associated with DNMT3B and that they are methylated in more than one colon cancer cell line relative to normal colon epithelial cells (CCD841). Among these, only DCC [54] and CAVEOLIN1 [55] have recently been reported to be methylated in colorectal carcinoma. DMRT1 is methylated in gastric cancer [56] whereas HOXB13 is methylated in melanoma [57], renal cancer [58] and breast cancer [45]. Further, analysis of a subset of these genes (DCC, TBX18, TBX5, SLIT1) in primary colon cancer revealed tumor-specific methylation. Recently several investigators have identified genes methylated in colorectal cancer some of which were also detected in the stool of colorectal cancer patients [41]. Different etiology, genetic background and the techniques used probably account for the identification of distinct methylated genes [59]. Cluster analysis demonstrated that tumors with dense methylation at the upstream CGI of HOXB13 gene clustered together (Figure S1). It would be of interest to analyze a large cohort of colorectal tumors to determine whether methylation of HOXB13 occurs in specific type of tumors and this epigenetic modification can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for colorectal cancer.
HOXB13 belongs to the homeobox family of transcription factors. It is a unique developmentally regulated protein that is up- or down-regulated depending upon the cellular context. While it is upregulated in ovarian [60] and endometrial cancers [61] where it functions as a tumor promoter, its expression is suppressed in malignant melanoma [57], renal [58], prostate [62], colorectal [63] and breast [45] cancer. HOXB13 is methylated in malignant melanoma, renal and breast cancer in the CGIs spanning the immediate upstream promoter and exon 1. Surprisingly, this region is essentially methylation free in normal colon and colorectal tumors (Figure 4). Methylation at an upstream CGI located β�Ό4.5 kb upstream of the HOXB13 transcription start site in primary colorectal tumors and colon cancer cell lines suggests that chromatin structure of this region acquires a unique conformation accessible to DNMTs. C/EBPΞ± is another transcription factor that is tumor-specifically methylated at an upsteam CGI in lung [64] and head and neck cancer [65]. Recent high throughput analysis has identified many more genes that are methylated at far upstream CGIs and even in coding regions [6]. The upstream CGI of HOXB13 appears to contribute to its promoter activity in colon cancer cells and harbors several conserved cis-regulatory elements some of which encompass CpG dinucleotides. It is, therefore, likely that methylation of this region is involved in modulating expression of HOXB13 and that this mechanism is unique to colon cancer cells. It would be of interest to examine whether HOXB13 knockout mice are susceptible to colon tumorigenesis spontaneously, after crossing with Apc/Min+, Mlh1β�’/β�’ mice or upon exposure to carcinogens. Similarly, identification of HOXB13 target genes in colon epithelial cells is likely to elucidate the mechanism of its tumor suppressor function. Generation of immunoprecipitation grade antibody for HOXB13 will help us to answer this question. Studies along these lines are in progress.

Precipitated DNA ranging in size from 0.6 to 3 kb were subjected to CpG island microarrary. The chromatin was cleared with pre-immune IgG and protein A beads. The precipitated DNA was dissolved in RIPA buffer and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with the same antibody to minimize pull down of false positive targets. This DNA was then separated on an agarose gel and DNA from 0.5 to 3 kb in size was purified by using Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), labeled with Cy5-labeled dNTP and hybridized to a CpG island library coated on glass slides. The same amount of input DNA and mock-immunoprecipitated DNA (with rabbit preimmune-IgG) was used as control. We selected only those genes for further analysis where the signal in ChIP DNA was greater than 2 fold compared to the control rabbit IgG signal.(0.16 MB DOC)Click here for additional data file.Table S3Genomic DNA from different colon cancer and normal colon epithelial (CCD841) cells were digested with Hpa II, Msp I or mock-digested and an aliquot (100 ng) of DNA from each was subjected to PCR with primers specific for CGI of each gene followed by separation of the PCR products on an agarose gel.
