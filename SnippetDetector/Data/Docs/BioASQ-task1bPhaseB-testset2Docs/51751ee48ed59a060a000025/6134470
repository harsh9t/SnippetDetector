The effects of insulin and thyroid hormone treatments on cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular function were investigated in chronic streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities were depressed significantly in microsomal samples from diabetic rats in comparison with control (P less than 0.05). This defect was seen at various times of incubation (1-20 min) and different concentrations of free Ca2+ (10(-7) to 10(-5) M Ca2+) and was accompanied by changes in the protein composition and phospholipid contents of the microsomal fraction. The defect in calcium transport in microsomal vesicles was not evident until 28 days after streptozotocin (65 mg/kg iv) injection, whereas increases in plasma glucose levels due to insulin-deficiency occurred within 3 days. All changes in function and composition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum were reversed by insulin administration to the diabetic rats. Although the plasma level of thyroid hormone was decreased in the diabetic rat, thyroid hormone treatment did not restore microsomal calcium transport in the diabetic animals. The results of this study provide some evidence that the depression in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular calcium accumulation during diabetes is a consequence of insulin deficiency and associated chronic metabolic changes but the hypothyroid condition that accompanies experimental diabetes does not appear to play any role in this defect.
