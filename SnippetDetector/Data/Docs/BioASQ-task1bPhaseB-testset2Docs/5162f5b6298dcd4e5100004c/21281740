Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis. The present study aims to validate the neutral Comet assay for genotoxicity assessment in Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R(+)) with three well known DSBs inducers i.e. cyclophosphamide (CP), bleomycin (BLM), cisplatin (CPT) and subsequently its efficacy in detecting DSBs in the organism exposed to a well known environmental chemical, chromium [Cr(VI)]. Third instar larvae of D. melanogaster were fed different concentrations of BLM, CPT and CP (50.0-200.0μg/ml) or Cr(VI) (5.0-20.0μg/ml) mixed standard Drosophila food for 48h. Neutral Comet assay was performed in cells of mid gut and brain from control and treated larvae. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in the migration of DNA in cells of the exposed organisms. A comparison among DNA lesions per mole number of the test chemical in the exposed groups showed that both BLM and CPT induce more DSBs than CP. Interestingly, Cr(VI) at 20.0μg/ml was found to induce significantly increased (p<0.001) DSBs in the exposed organism as compared to the control. The study while validating neutral Comet assay in D. melanogaster suggests its use for in vivo assessment of environmental chemical induced DSBs.
