urora- is a centrosome-associated, cell cycle-regulated member of the urora serine/threonine protein kinase family which is important for mitosis (ischoff & lowman, 1999; armena & arnshaw, 2003; iet & rigent, 1999; igg, 2001). he protein level and activity of urora- peaks at 2 and during mitosis whereas expression is low in resting cells (asai et al, 2008; hou et al, 1998).  variety of urora- substrates have been identified, of which the best characterized are p53, 2, juba and - (irota et al, 2003; eraldi et al, 2004). urora- is essential for multiple processes during mitosis, including mitotic spindle formation and activation of cell cycle regulators such as 1 and 1 (azales et al, 2005; eki et al, 2008). erhaps unsurprisingly, targeting urora- pharmacologically, by  interference or by genetic knockout, leads to aberrant mitosis and cell death (anfredi et al, 2007; asai et al, 2008). he urora- gene is located on human chromosome 20q13β€”a region that is amplified in a variety of human tumours (allioniemi et al, 1994). urora- is overexpressed in a broad range of human tumours, including primary colorectal carcinoma, gliomas and breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers (ischoff et al, 1998; ritsko et al, 2003; hou et al, 1998). ctopic expression of urora- induces, under certain conditions, abnormal spindle formation leading to polyploidy and has been reported to transform 33 and at1 fibroblasts (ischoff et al, 1998; eraldi et al, 2002; hou et al, 1998). evertheless, the exact mechanisms by which urora- overexpression induces tumorigenicity remain unclear.  role of urora- not directly linked to mitosis is its involvement in -damage response (). urora- activity is tightly regulated during the response to genotoxic agents and is important for a normal  (azales et al, 2005; rystyniak et al, 2006).
 damage is continuously generated by a variety of mechanisms including cell metabolism, exogenous genotoxic agents and the collapse of replication forks. mongst the many types of  lesions,  double-strand breaks (s) are especially lethal if left unrepaired. eficiency in the  repair processes that normally deal with s is associated with cancer susceptibility as illustrated by the tumour suppressor activity of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 which both are part of the  repair machinery (astan & artek, 2004). here are two mechanistically distinct pathways repairing s, the non-homologous end-joining () and the homologous recombination () pathways. he  pathway mediates the re-ligation of the two broken  ends, while  involves the use of a homologous sequence as a template to faithfully repair the damaged region. onsequently  is an essentially error-free repair pathway whereas  is mostly error-prone and generates mutations.  requires a readily available homologous  sequence, a condition that is best fulfilled once the  has been replicated, in the  and 2 phases of the cell cycle. ndeed,  is repressed in 1, and becomes activated during  and 2 phases, while  is constitutively active throughout the cell cycle (ao et al, 2008b).
here is an intricate connection between the  and the cell cycle at multiple levels. irst, as a response to a  is elicited, selection of the most appropriate  repair pathway occurs. his crucial step, which may have dramatic consequences on the maintenance of genome integrity, is considerably affected by cell cycle phase. ecent findings have illuminated the mechanistic basis for the cell cycle-dependent activation of  repair pathways. n both yeast and mammals, the 2 cyclin-dependent kinase 1 stimulates 5β€²β€“3β€² resection of the  ends (azayeri et al, 2006). his modification is specifically required for , generates a substrate for the initiation of this process, and also triggers the full activation of the  damage checkpoint (ylon et al, 2004; uertas et al, 2008; uertas & ackson, 2009; ra et al, 2004; azayeri et al, 2006). t a subsequent stage, once the  machinery is fully active, the cell cycle is normally stalled by the activation of the  damage checkpoints. or the 2/  damage checkpoint, the cell cycle arrest is mostly contributed by the regulation of 25 phosphatases and 1 either by the checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 or by the / kinases-dependent phosphorylation of 1. hese two pathways converge to maintain an efficient inhibition of 1 and hence prevent cell cycle progression. inally, during the  damage checkpoint recovery, the signal emanating from the mitotic kinase 1 becomes dominant and stimulates cell cycle progression. nterestingly, during this late phase of the , but also during unperturbed cell cycle, urora- has been identified as the upstream activator of 1 (acurek et al, 2008; eki et al, 2008). he resulting activation of 1 stems from two complementary, concomitant actions. irstly, 1 and urora- directly regulate 25 and 1. econdly, 1 activation, by mediating a phosphorylation dependent degradation of laspin, leads to the inactivation of 1 and hence alleviates the opposing effect of the checkpoint protein to the cell cycle (amely et al, 2006; eschiaroli et al, 2006). n addition, the core machinery of  is also targeted by the checkpoint recovery signalling. 2 activity, which is required for 51 loading onto single-strand  (ss. DNA), is also controlled by PLK1- and CDK-triggered phosphorylation (Esashi et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2004).
It appears, therefore, that a proper balance between the activity of cell cycle regulators and DNA repair proteins is crucial to produce an adapted response to DNA damage. One of the major regulators of the cell cycle, Aurora-A, is aberrantly expressed in cancer and its deregulation is a driving event in tumour formation (Greenman et al, 2007). This led us to investigate if the misexpression of Aurora-A observed in cancer could affect the DDR. We found that expression of high Aurora-A levels leads to the silencing of HR, the major error-free DSB repair pathway, in response to DNA damage. Aurora-A overexpression represses CHK1 kinase activity and the repression of HR requires the activation of PLK1. We propose that this function of Aurora-A could contribute to the oncogenic activity of Aurora-A and provide basis for novel therapeutic strategies.

urora- overexpression impairs 51 focus formation. To assess the potential effect of Aurora-A on HR, we examined the formation of nuclear RAD51 foci after DNA damage. The localization of these foci after damage most likely represents the loading of the RAD51 DNA recombinase onto damaged DNA, an essential part of the HR process known to be controlled by other HR proteins, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 (West, 2003). MCF10A cells were infected with lentiviral vectors expressing either high levels of both Aurora-A and GFP (from a bicistronic mRNA) or GFP alone. The levels of overexpressed Aurora-A in the infected MCF10A cell lines were comparable to the levels of Aurora-A found in a panel of cancer cell lines (Supporting Information Fig 1). In MCF10A cells expressing high levels of Aurora-A, RAD51 focus induction was impaired, suggesting a potentially repressive effect of Aurora-A on HR (Fig 1A, B). To address whether high Aurora-A levels altered the sensing of DNA lesions, we also examined the formation of serine 139 phosphorylated histone H2AX (Ξ³-H2AX) nuclear foci (Bonner et al, 2008). High level Aurora-A expression did not affect Ξ³-H2AX foci formation, suggesting that DNA damage sensing was not altered (Fig 1A, C). To exclude the possibility that these effects were specific to the cell model used, we also assessed RAD51 and Ξ³-H2AX foci formation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Supporting Information Fig 2). ES cells transfected with a plasmid driving the expression of a myc-tagged Aurora-A showed impaired RAD51 foci formation upon X-ray treatment, while eliciting a normal Ξ³-H2AX foci induction. As a control, ES cells lacking a functional HR pathway due to BRCA2 gene inactivation were used. A reduction of RAD51 foci formation was also observed (Farmer et al, 2005); (BRCA2β�’/β�’; Supporting Information Fig 2A).Figure 1Impairment of irradiation-induced RAD51 nuclear focus formation by Aurora-A overexpressionMCF10A cells were infected with a lentivirus construct driving the expression of GFP (empty vector) or both GFP and Aurora-A (Aurora-A) and mixed in equal proportion with non-infected cells to provide an internal control. The mixed cells were exposed to 5-Gy X-ray, followed by a 24 h (A) or 4, 16 or 32 h (B and C) recovery.A. Immunofluorescence images of MCF10A cells stained for RAD51 (grey) and Ξ³-H2AX (red).

Quantification of RAD51 (B) and Ξ³-H2AX (C) foci-positive nuclei. Immunofluorescence images of MCF10A were acquired as in (A). The cells were pre-treated with the Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8054 (Aurora-A + MLN8054) or vehicle, 1 h before irradiation. Nuclei containing more than three foci were scored as positive. The percentage of RAD51 (B) or Ξ³-H2AX (C) positive nuclei of non-infected (GFP negative) or infected (GFP positive) cells was plotted. Error bars represent SEM. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.Given that Aurora-A is a kinase, we assessed whether catalytic activity was required for the modulation of RAD51 function. Pre-treatment of MCF10A cells overexpressing Aurora-A with a specific Aurora-A kinase inhibitor MLN8054, at concentrations that preferentially inhibit Aurora-A (Manfredi et al, 2007), restored normal RAD51 foci induction in response to ionizing radiation (Fig 1B). The specificity of this effect was confirmed by the observation that the Aurora-B kinase inhibitor ZM447439 (Ditchfield et al, 2003) was unable to restore the RAD51 response in cells expressing high levels of Aurora-A (Supporting Information Fig 3). The requirement of Aurora-A kinase activity for the inhibition of RAD51 foci formation was also confirmed by the use of a kinase inactive mutant of Aurora-A (Aurora-A D256A; Jiang et al, 2003; Supporting Information Fig 4).The effect of Aurora-A on HR is not caused by cell cycle perturbationThe cellular choice between NHEJ and HR is regulated during the cell cycle and therefore, reduced activity of the HR pathways could conceivably result from modulation of the cell cycle by Aurora-A overexpression. To exclude this possibility, we monitored the cell cycle profile of irradiated MCF10A and ES cells by flow cytometry (Fig 2; Supporting Information Fig 2C). In these experimental systems, we did not observe the generation of polyploid cells upon overexpression of Aurora-A as described in other experimental settings (Meraldi et al, 2002; Supporting Information Fig 5). As expected, irradiation resulted in a cell cycle arrest in both cellular models. DNA profiles of MCF10A were performed at various times after irradiation. Up to 16 h after irradiation, the DNA profiles of Aurora-A overexpressing and normal cells were indistinguishable. As, at this time, a pronounced effect of Aurora-A overexpression on RAD51 foci formation is already clearly visible, we conclude that Aurora-A kinase activity modulates the HR independently of its function in cell cycle. However, at later time points, the presence of high levels of Aurora-A leads to cell cycle re-entry. Therefore, it is possible that, as the DNA damage checkpoint weakens, the kinase may overcome the arrest. Alternatively, this might reflect that a faster and therefore, less accurate repair pathway, such as NHEJ, operates in these conditions.Figure 2Effect of Aurora-A overexpression on the DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrestMCF10A cells were infected with a lentivirus construct driving the expression of GFP (empty vector) or both GFP and Aurora-A (Aurora-A) and mixed in equal proportion with non-infected cells to provide an internal control (fluorescence images, top left panel). The mixed cells were exposed to 5-Gy X-ray, followed by a 16, 24 or 40 h recovery, or left untreated, as indicated. The DNA was counterstained by Hoechst 33342, and the DNA profiles of infected (GFP positive) and uninfected (GFP negative cells) were acquired separately by flow cytometry.The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined from the DNA profiles shown in (A) and plotted.Aurora-A overexpression inhibits HRAs RAD51 activity is essential for HR, we assessed whether the impairment of RAD51 foci formation by Aurora-A overexpression could lead to a corresponding silencing of homology directed DNA repair itself. To address this, we used a previously validated synthetic DSB repair substrate stably introduced into 293 cells. This model is based on the induction of a DSB by the restriction enzyme I-SceI at a single chromosomal locus. When this lesion is repaired by a homology-directed mechanism, a functional blasticidin resistance gene is generated (Tutt et al, 2001; Fig 3A). Using either colony formation (Fig 3B, C) or GFP competition (Fig 3D, E) assays to estimate blasticidin resistance, fewer blasticidin resistant 293 cells were generated when Aurora-A was overexpressed, suggesting that HR is repressed by Aurora-A in this model. In line with the RAD51 foci formation assay, the kinase activity of Aurora-A is required for its effect on HR, as the overexpression of a kinase inactive mutant, Aurora-A S361*, did not affect the acquisition of blasticidin resistance in this assay (Fig 3B-E; Bibby et al, 2009). We also verified that the cell cycle profile of the 293 cells was unperturbed by Aurora-A overexpression in these experiments (Supporting Information Fig 6). Taken together, these results indicate that Aurora-A exerts a repressive effect on the DNA repair by HR.Figure 3HR deficiency in Aurora-A overexpressing cellsSchematic representation of the HR repair substrate DR1Bsd. The single copy HR reporter construct chromosomally integrated into HEK 293 cells consists of two tandem copies of the blasticidin resistance gene (Bsd). The insertion of an I-SceI restriction site (black vertical dashes), which also encodes two in-frame stop codons, into the upstream copy of the blasticidin-resistance gene (S1Bsd; grey box) prevents its expression. The downstream copy of the gene (5β€²Ξ”Bsd; black diagonal dashed box) is promoterless, and hence non-functional. Expression of the I-SceI restriction enzyme induces a DNA DSB at the I-SceI restriction site in S1Bsd. The repair of this lesion by NHEJ will mostly leave the S1Bsd gene non-functional, whereas HR mechanisms, using the 5β€²Ξ”Bsd copy as a repair template, generates a functional gene and cell resistance to blasticidin.293 cells bearing the HR repair substrate DR1Bsd were infected with a lentiviral vector expressing GFP alone (empty vector), or GFP along with Aurora-A (Aurora-A) or a kinase inactive Aurora-A mutant (Aurora-A S361*). Infection efficiency was monitored in flow cytometry by the measurement of GFP expression (infection efficiency). Non-infected cells were included as a control. The plasmid encoding the NLS-tagged I-SceI restriction enzyme was co-transfected with a DsRed expressing construct. The transfection efficiency was assessed by flow cytometry measurement of DsRed expression (transfection efficiency). Cells were then grown in normal medium (no selection) or in the presence of blasticidin (blasticidin) and stained with crystal violet as described in material and methods.Colonies formed in the presence of blasticidin were scored and plotted, after normalization by the platting efficiency (number of colonies formed in the absence of blasticidin) and the transfection efficiency.

Error bars represent SEM.Aurora-A regulates HR through the PLK1/CHK1 pathwayThe presence of DNA damage triggers a coordinated cellular response aimed at repairing damaged DNA while at the same time stalling the cell cycle so that damage is not eventually passed onto daughter cells. Unsurprisingly, cross-talk between repair and checkpoint pathways has been described (Harper & Elledge, 2007). Interestingly, the Polo-like kinase (PLK1) was recently shown to control the degradation of Claspin (Mamely et al, 2006) and hence the activity of the checkpoint protein CHK1, which is also required for HR (Sorensen et al, 2005). Aurora-A kinase has been identified as an upstream activator of PLK1 (Seki et al, 2008). Based on these observations we investigated whether high level Aurora-A expression could modulate HR activity through a PLK1-mediated regulation of the CHK1-Claspin complex.We first determined the activity of PLK1 in either irradiated (5 Gy) or untreated MCF10A cells expressing endogenous or high levels of Aurora-A (Fig 4A). Using an antibody specific to the active threonine 210 phosphorylated form of PLK1 (p-Thr210-PLK1), we observed an increased PLK1 activity in cells expressing high Aurora-A levels. Moreover, the Aurora-A-mediated activation of PLK1 kinase activity was not affected by irradiation. We next tested the requirement of PLK1 activation for Aurora-A impairment of RAD51 focus formation by using a specific inhibitor of PLK1 kinase activity, BI2536 (Steegmaier et al, 2007). Inhibition of PLK1 efficiently abolished the effect of Aurora-A on RAD51 foci induction (Fig 4B), indicating that PLK1 activation is required for the impairment of RAD51 foci induction by Aurora-A.Figure 4Aurora-A activation of PLK1 is required for the impairment of RAD51 focus formationImmunoblot analysis of total PLK1, threonine 210 phosphorylated PLK1 (p-T210-PLK1) and Aurora-A in non-irradiated or irradiated (5 Gy) MCF10A cells infected with a lentiviral construct expressing GFP alone (empty vector) or GFP and Aurora-A (Aurora-A). Ezrin was used as loading control.PLK1 activity is required for the inhibition of RAD51 nuclear focus formation by Aurora-A. MCF10A cells were infected with a lentivirus construct driving the expression of GFP (empty vector) or both GFP and Aurora-A (Aurora-A) and mixed in equal proportion with non-infected cells to provide an internal control. The mixed cells were pre-treated with the PLK1 kinase inhibitor BI2536 (+BI2536) or with vehicle (β�’BI2536), 1 h before a 5-Gy X-ray treatment, followed by a 4, 16, 24 or 30 h recovery, as indicated. RAD51 foci were then detected by immunofluorescence and RAD51 foci-positive nuclei were scored in uninfected (GFP negative) and infected (GFP positive) cells as described in Fig 1B. Shown is the average percentage of RAD51 foci positive cells from two independent experiments. Error bars indicate SEM.To address whether the constitutive activation of PLK1 by Aurora-A could affect CHK1 activity, we immunoprecipitated CHK1 from MCF10A cells with varying levels of Aurora-A expression, and assessed the ability of CHK1 to phosphorylate the substrate myelin binding protein (MBP) in vitro. Both, basal and DNA-damage-induced CHK1 activities were decreased in MCF10A cells overexpressing Aurora-A (Fig 5A, B). Similar samples were analysed by immunoblot in order to directly monitor the phosphorylation status of CHK1. Two major activating phosphorylations of CHK1, on serine 317 and serine 345 (p-Ser317-CHK1 and p-Ser345-CHK1, respectively) were decreased in cells expressing high levels of Aurora-A (Fig 5C). The effect of Aurora-A was most likely specific to CHK1, as the activity of CHK2, when monitored by its autophosphorylation on the threonine 68 (p-T68-CHK2) residue, was not affected (Fig 5C). Finally, both basal and radiation-induced Claspin levels were also decreased by the presence of high Aurora-A levels (Fig 5C). Taken together, these results suggest that Aurora-A modulates CHK1 activity through PLK1-triggered Claspin degradation.Figure 5Aurora-A overexpression correlates with decreased CHK1 activityMCF10A cells infected with a lentiviral construct expressing Aurora-A (Aurora-A) or the corresponding empty vector (empty vector) were treated by 5-Gy X-ray, followed by 24 h recovery.

Ezrin was used as loading control.Increased radiosensitivity of MCF10A cells overexpressing Aurora-ADeficient HR causes sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Therefore, we examined the effect of high level Aurora-A expression on the radiosensitivity of normal human mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) using a clonogenic survival assay (Fig 6A). In this assay, MCF10A cells were infected with lentiviral vectors expressing either high levels of both Aurora-A and GFP (from a bicistronic mRNA; Aurora-A) or GFP alone (empty vector; Fig 6C). The ability of these cells to form colonies after irradiation was assessed. As expected, we observed a dose-dependent decrease of the colony formation. Moreover, the overexpression of Aurora-A substantially aggravates the effect of irradiation, when compared to cells expressing GFP alone. To confirm these results, we performed a GFP competition assay in which empty vector-, or Aurora-A-infected cells were mixed with non-infected cells used as an internal control (Fig 6B). As in the colony formation assay, Aurora-A overexpression sensitizes MCF10A cells to irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that Aurora-A expression modulates radiosensitivity and provided further evidence that high levels of Aurora-A might interfere with HR.Figure 6Aurora-A overexpression enhances cell sensitivity to irradiation and to PARP inhibitionA. MCF10A cells were infected with a lentivirus construct driving the expression of GFP (empty vector) or both GFP and Aurora-A (Aurora-A), and then exposed to 0-, 2-, 5- or 10-Gy X-ray.

Cell lysates were prepared from CAPAN-1 and PIR12 cells used in (D). The expression of Aurora-A and GFP were determined by immunoblotting. Ezrin was used as loading control.F, G. CAPAN1 and CAPAN1 cells overexpressing Aurora-A (F) and PIR12 and PIR12 overexpressing Aurora-A (G) were injected into the lateral flanks of athymic nude mice. The results are expressed as fold increase in tumour volume, Β±SEM. p-values were calculated by two-way ANOVA.Aurora-A overexpression confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitionPARP inhibition generates DNA lesions that are normally repaired by HR, and accordingly cells with compromised HR are highly sensitive to PARP inhibition (Ashworth, 2008). It has been previously shown that the CAPAN1 pancreatic tumour cell line, which carries the protein-truncating c.6174delT frameshift mutation (Goggins et al, 1996), is highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors such as KU0058948 (Edwards et al, 2008; McCabe et al, 2005). We have previously generated a CAPAN1-derived PARP inhibitor-resistant cell line, PIR12, which carries a functional BRCA2 gene and is thus HR competent (Edwards et al, 2008). We used this model to explore the effect of high level of Aurora-A expression on PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A sensitized the normally HR-competent PIR12 cell line to the potent PARP inhibitor KU0058948 (Farmer et al, 2005; Fig 6D, E). Conversely, high level Aurora-A expression was unable to increase PARP inhibitor sensitivity in the isogenic, HR deficient, CAPAN1 cell line. Finally, to assess the in vivo selectivity of PARP inhibition towards Aurora-A overexpressing tumours, we performed xenograft studies in nude mice using CAPAN1 (Fig 6F) and PIR12 (Fig 6G) cells expressing normal or high levels of Aurora-A. Mice were treated with the PARP inhibitor KU0058948. Similarly to our in vitro data (Fig 6D), the CAPAN1 tumours were sensitive to the PARP inhibitor, regardless of Aurora-A status (p < 0.001 and <0.05, respectively). The PIR12 tumours, however, were resensitized to PARP inhibition by overexpression of Aurora-A (p < 0.001). Our data showing radiosensitization of Aurora-A overexpressing cells combined with the finding that PARP inhibitor sensitivity was increased by high Aurora-A expression, further suggest that HR is suppressed and that these cells may be sensitized to agents targeting deficiencies in this DNA repair pathway.

Here, we show that Aurora-A overexpressing cells have suppressed HR. Our results suggest a signalling cascade emanating from Aurora-A, where activated PLK1 represses CHK1 activity through Claspin regulation, resulting in inhibition of RAD51 function and decreased HR (Fig 7). HR activity has been recently reported to be repressed before and upon mitotic entry (Mao et al, 2008b). This repression of HR has conceivably evolved to prevent annealing of DNA between sister chromatids as they are scheduled to segregate into daughter cells. Interestingly, the repression of HR that occurs upon mitotic entry parallels the normal expression and activation pattern of Aurora-A. Repression of HR upon entry to mitosis might be part of the normal function of Aurora-A.
Figure 7Model for the regulation of the DNA damage response by Aurora-ADuring the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, HR is the preferred pathway to repair DSBs. Activated CHK1 stimulates repair by phosphorylating the RAD51 recombinase, while stalling the cell cycle by keeping CDK1 inactive. CDK1 inactivation is mediated by a number of pathways, including inactivation of CDC25 phosphatases and Wee1 kinase by CHK1.High levels of Aurora-A result in constitutive activation of the PLK1 kinase. Claspin is degraded upon phosphorylation by PLK1, an event normally restricted to the G2 checkpoint recovery phase. The inactivation of CHK1 that ensues weakens the response of HR protein, such as RAD51 accumulation to the DSBs. Consequently, DNA is repaired by the constitutively operative NHEJ pathway. The shortening of the cell cycle arrest observed in Aurora-A overexpressing cells after irradiation might be a result of both the activation of a faster DNA repair process, such as the NHEJ pathway and the stimulation of CDK1.We did not observe persistence of Ξ³-H2AX signal in cells overexpressing Aurora-A, suggesting that the repair might be fulfilled by an alternative error-prone mechanism. A series of reports have demonstrated that in the absence of functional HR, error-prone repair mechanisms predominate (Moynahan et al, 2001; Tutt et al, 2001). Amongst the possible alternative mechanisms to HR, NHEJ is a good candidate as the repaired DSBs in HR deficient cells are characterized by deletions flanked by short tandem repeats (Edwards et al, 2008) which is reminiscent of the repair performed by NHEJ mechanism. The use of NHEJ, which is a faster process compared to HR, is also suggested by the shorter cell cycle arrest observed in Aurora-A overexpressing cells (Fig 2A, B; Mao et al, 2008a).
Our results suggest that overexpression of Aurora-A results in a repression of the error-free HR pathway, presumably favouring a lower-fidelity process, such as NHEJ. This might consequently increase genomic instability and account, at least in part, for the oncogenic activity of Aurora-A. Finally, several small molecule inhibitors of PARP have shown therapeutic efficacy against tumours deficient in HR in pre- and early clinical studies (Bryant et al, 2005; Farmer et al, 2005; Fong, 2009). Our results suggest that Aurora-A overexpression decreases the repair of DSB by HR pathways and confers sensitivity to PARP inhibition. This latter observation may have important implications for the development of cancer therapeutics aimed at targeting tumour cells with Aurora-A overexpression. Moreover, previous studies have reported a lack of correlation between the sensitivity of cells treated with Aurora kinase inhibitors and Aurora-A levels (Chan et al, 2007; Soncini et al, 2006) suggesting that methods other than targeting Aurora-A are required. This raises the possibility of extending the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibition to tumours with high levels of Aurora-A expression.

nhibitors. Aurora-B inhibitor ZM447439 (Ditchfield et al, 2003) and PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 (Steegmaier et al, 2007) were obtained from Tocris Bioscience and AxonMedchem, respectively. Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8054 (Manfredi et al, 2007) was synthesized in-house. The PARP inhibitor KU0058948 was provided by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals.Cell culture and transfectionHEK 293 and the packaging line 293T were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), 2.4 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Βµg/ml streptomycin. MCF10A cells were grown in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% horse serum, epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml) (Peprotech), hydroxycortisone (0.5 Βµg/ml), cholera toxin (100 ng/ml), insulin (10 Βµg/ml) (Sigmaβ€“Aldrich), penicillin (60 Βµg/ml) and streptomycin (100 Βµg/ml). CAPAN1 and PIR12 cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% FCS, 2.4 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Βµg/ml streptomycin. ES cells were grown on mitomycin-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as feeder cells, or on a gelatin-coated substrate in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 15% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma), MEM-non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 50 ΒµM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and 100 U/ml (when grown on feeder MEFs) or 200 U/ml (when grown on gelatin-coated substrate) LIF (Esgro, Chemical International).The paper explainedPROBLEMThe Aurora-A gene is frequently upregulated in a variety of cancers, including breast and colon cancer. The clinical application of inhibitors of Aurora-A kinase activity is now being evaluated in clinical trials. However, there is a need for a better understanding of the oncogenic properties of Aurora-A to identify the relevant patient population for treatment.RESULTSWe demonstrate that deregulation of Aurora-A in normal and cancer cell lines affects DNA damage repair. Aurora-A represses the HR repair pathway and confers increased cellular sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (known to target cancer cells with deficient DNA repair pathways) in vitro and in vivo.IMPACTThe data shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying Aurora-A tumorigenic properties and we propose using PARP inhibitors as a new therapeutic approach to target tumour cells with upregulated Aurora-A.Transfection of 293T packaging cells, 293 and ES cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Plasmids and lentivirusesA human myc-tagged Aurora-A cDNA was PCR amplified using the following primers containing a PmeI restriction site: AurA F 5β€²-GTTTAAACATGGAGCAGAAGCTG-3β€², AurA R 5β€²-GTTTAAACCTAAGACTGTTTGCT-3β€² and pCMV-myc-Aurora-A as a template. The amplification product was inserted into PCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNA was released by PmeI digestion before insertion into PmeI linearized pWPI lentiviral expression plasmid (addgene). Mutations in Aurora-A cDNA were performed by site directed mutagenesis. The human Gadd45a cDNA was a kind gift from Richard Bayliss. The cDNA was released from the pET30 plasmid by digestion with EcoRI and NcoI, treated with Klenow DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends and inserted into the PmeI linearized pWPI.The lentivirus production in 293T packaging cells was performed following the guidelines provided by Didier Trono's laboratory (available online http://tronolab.epfl.ch/). Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected as described above with the pWPI expression plasmids, the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelope vector pMD2.G. Transfection medium was changed after 16 h, and the lentivirus-containing medium was subsequently harvested every 24 h for 3 days and frozen at β�’80Β°C. Infectivity of the viral solution was titrated on 293T cells. MCF10A, CAPAN1, PIR12 and HEK293 were infected by adding viral particles to the growing medium for at least 24 h.ImmunofluorescenceCells grown on a glass coverslip were fixed in PBSβ€“4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, permeabilized in PBSβ€“0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, blocked in PBSβ€“2%FCSβ€“1%BSA, before incubation with rabbit-anti-RAD51 (Santa Cruz) and mouse-anti-Ξ³-H2AX (Upstate) antibodies. Secondary antibodies were Alexa FluorΒ® 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) and Alexa FluorΒ® 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen). DNA was conterstained with 4β€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Image acquisition was performed on a Leica SP2 confocal scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, Bucks, UK).Flow cytometryFlow cytometry data acquisition was performed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD). Analysis was carried out using the FacsDiva software (BD). For all flow cytometry analysis, live cells were gated based on a FSC-A versus SSC-A dot plot. GFP was detected using the FITC-A channel. DNA profiling was performed by propidium iodide (PI) staining of cold ethanol fixed-cells after RNAse treatment (ES cells) using the PE-Cy5 channel, or by live staining with Hoechst 33342 (Pacific blue channel). In both cases, single cells were selected for analysis based on SSC-W versus SSC-A and PE-Cy5-W versus PE-Cy5-A (PI staining) or Pacific blue-W versus Pacific blue-A (Hoechst 33342 staining) plot gating.Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and kinase assayProteins were extracted in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 10 mM Ξ²-glycerophosphate). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: Rabbit anti-Aurora-A, anti-p-Ser317-CHK1, anti-p-Ser345-CHK1 and anti-p-Thr68-CHK2 (Cell Signalling), rabbit anti-Claspin (Abcam), mouse anti-Aurora-A and mouse anti-GFP (clone JL-8) (BD Bioscience), goat anti-CHK2, mouse anti-CHK1 (Santa Cruz), mouse anti-p-T210-PLK1 (BD Pharmingen) and mouse anti-PLK1 (Upstate). The anti-Ezrin antibody used for loading control was a kind gift from Prof. Clare Isacke.For immunoprecipitation, 500 Βµg of protein was diluted 1:10 in binding buffer [PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 10 mM Ξ²-glycerophosphate] and incubated with 2 Βµg of mouse anti-CHK1 antibody (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4Β°C. Immunocomplexes were pulled-down by addition of Protein A-AgarosePlus (Santa Cruz) and washed three times in binding buffer, resuspended in 1Γ— kinase assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml MBP, 10 ΒµM cold ATP, 2 ΒµCi Ξ³-33P-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer), at 25Β°C for 30 min. Proteins were then resolved in SDSβ€“PAGE before autoradiography. Band density was measured using the ImageJ software. The gel was subsequently rehydrated and Coomassie stained (SimplyBlue SafeStain, Invitrogen).Homologous recombination reporter assay293 cells bearing the stably integrated DNA repair reporter construct (see Fig 3; Tutt et al, 2001) were infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP alone or GFP along with Aurora-A (wild type or mutants) or Gadd45a. Cells were subsequently co-transfected with a plasmid expressing an NLS-tagged I-SceI restriction enzyme and a DsRed expressing vector. After 24 h, the transfection efficiency was assessed by flow cytometry quantification of DsRed positive cells. For colony formation assay, cells were plated in six-well plates in the presence of 5 Βµg/ml of blasticidin (Invitrogen; 1.2 Γ— 106 cells) or without (3 Γ— 105 cells) antibiotic. After 21 days, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Colonies were counted in a ColCount (Oxford Optronics). For the GFP competition assay, GFP positive cells were quantified by flow cytometry at various time during the selection process.PARP inhibitor sensitivity assayExponentially growing cells were seeded in 24-well plates and exposed continuously to the PARP inhibitor KU0058948 (gift from KuDOS/AstraZeneca) at concentrations ranging from 10β�’9 to 10β�’5 M, or DMSO. Medium and inhibitor were replaced every 4 days. PARP inhibitor- or DMSO-treated cells were split equally when appropriate. After 60 days the survival of KU0058948 versus DMSO-treated cells was measured using a luminescent cell viability assay (CellTiter-Glo, Promega).XenograftsCAPAN1 and PIR12 cells (4 Γ— 106) infected with empty lentiviral vector (empty vector) or a vector expressing Aurora-A (Aurora-A) were mixed 1:1 in matrigel (BD Biosciences) and then injected subcutaneously into the lateral flank of 6- to 8-week-old female athymic nude mice (12 animals per cohort, 24 in total). The mice were allowed to recover for 2 days and then treated with KU0058948 or vehicle alone. PARP inhibitor (or vehicle) was administered by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 15 mg/kg in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HBC; Farmer et al, 2005) for five consecutive days followed by 2 days of no treatment after which the same treatment cycle was continued until the end of the study. Tumour volumes were measured every 2β€“4 days from the initiation of tumour growth. Tumours were measured every 2β€“4 days after the initiation of drug dosing. The results are expressed as fold increase in tumour volume, Β±SEM. p-values were calculated by two-way ANOVA.
