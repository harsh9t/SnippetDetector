In human cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired primarily by the DNA end-joining (EJ) process and thus, abnormal DNA EJ activities lead to an accumulation of mutations and/or aneuploidy, resulting in genetic instability of cells. Since genetic instability is the hallmark of cancer cells, we studied the DNA EJ activities of normal, non-malignant immortalized and malignant human epithelial cells to investigate the association between DNA EJ and carcinogenesis. We found a significant diminution of precise (error-free) DNA EJ activities in non-malignant immortalized human oral keratinocytes (HOK-16B) and human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells compared to that in normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK). Moreover, abnormal DNA EJ activities were detected exclusively in HOK-16B and HNSCC cells due to microhomology-mediated and non-microhomology-mediated end-joining activities in these cells. These data indicated that aberrant DNA EJ activity may be partly responsible for genetic instability and oncogenic transformation.
