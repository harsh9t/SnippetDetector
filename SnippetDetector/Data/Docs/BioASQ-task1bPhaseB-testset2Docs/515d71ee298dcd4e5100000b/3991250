<abstract>
Vancomycin pharmacokinetics were studied in nine premature infants. Infants weighing less than 1,000 gm had significantly larger volumes of drug distribution and consequently longer drug half-lives than larger premature infants, regardless of postconceptual or actual age. These differences alter the vancomycin dosing recommendations in these two groups of premature infants. We recommend initial dosage regimens consisting of a loading dose of vancomycin of 25 mg/kg followed by doses of 15 mg/kg every 12 hours for infants with weights less than 1,000 gm. Infants weighing over 1,000 gm should receive 10 mg/kg every 12 hours, with a loading dose of 12.5 mg/kg. Serum vancomycin concentration should be monitored, however, for final optimization of therapy.
