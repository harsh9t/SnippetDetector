Deadenylases specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'- to 5'-end direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product. Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain. In this research, we investigated the roles of these RNA-binding domains by comparing the structural features and enzymatic properties of mutants lacking either one or two of the three RNA-binding domains. The results showed that the R3H domain had the ability to bind various oligonucleotides at the micromolar level with no oligo(A) specificity. The removal of the R3H domain dissociated PARN into monomers, which still possessed the RNA-binding ability and catalytic functions. Unlike the critical role of the RRM domain in PARN processivity, the removal of the R3H domain did not affect the catalytic pattern of PARN. Our results suggested that both R3H and RRM domains were essential for the high affinity of long poly(A) substrate, but the R3H domain did not contribute to the substrate recognition of PARN. Compared to the RRM domain, the R3H domain played a more important role in the structural integrity of the dimeric PARN. The multiple RNA-binding domain architecture endows PARN the property of highly efficient catalysis in a highly processive mode.
