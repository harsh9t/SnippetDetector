nterferons (s) are vertebrate-specific cytokines with key roles in innate immunity (1,2). hey induce a range of biological responses, of which their antiviral, antitumor and immuno-modulatory effects are of major medical significance (3,4). pon viral infection, cells begin synthesizing and secreting the s, which then interact with specific receptors at the cell surface to activate an intracellular signal cascade, eventually leading to the changes in gene expression that dictate the biological outcome.
he 2-5 system forms a major part of the cellular antiviral defense in which s initially induce expression of a set of double-stranded -dependent 2β€²β€“5β€²-oligoadenlyate synthetases (ds. RNA-dependent 2β€²β€“5β€²-OASs). Upon activation by viral dsRNA, these enzymes begin synthesizing a set of unusual 5β€²-triphosphorylated, 2β€²β€“5β€²-linked oligoadenylate polyribonucleotides (2-5As) from ATP with the general structure, pppA(2β€²p5 β€²A)n (5). Accumulation of 2-5As then causes activation of RNase L, an otherwise latent endoribonuclease, leading to the degradation of viral RNA. However, RNase L is only moderately specific towards viral RNA and will degrade cellular RNA if not deactivated (6,7). Consequently, the intracellular 2-5A level is quickly downregulated by a nuclease, which, in contrast to canonical exonucleases, degrades 2β€²β€“5β€²-linked RNA (8,9).
The removal of 2-5As is thought to initially involve dephosphorylation by a 5β€²-phosphatase, as activation of the pathway by viral infection and IFN stimulation in mice and in cell cultures have been shown to lead to accumulation of 5β€²-dephosphorylated 2-5As (2-5A core molecules) rather than their 5β€²-triphosphorylated counterparts (10,11). Although less active in stimulating RNase L (12), the dephosphorylated 2-5A core molecules still have significant antiviral and anti-growth properties and need to be fully removed to shut down the response (13,14). Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated 2-5As can be degraded by a 2β€²β€“5β€²-specific exoribonuclease known as 2β€²-phosphodiesterase [2β€²-PDE (also named phosphodiesterase 12 (PDE12))], which is thus a key regulator of the 2-5A system (9).
2β€²-PDE is also able to degrade 3β€²β€“5β€²-linked oligoadenylate RNAs in vitro (9,15,16), and has therefore been classified as a putative RNA deadenylase (17). Deadenylases are a diverse group of enzymes responsible for removing the poly(A) tail during early mRNA turnover in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. Most deadenylases are 3β€²β€“5β€² exonucleases that produce AMP by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bonds of RNA in a divalent metal ion-dependent fashion (17). The process represents the first and rate-limiting step during mRNA turnover and is therefore highly regulated (17,18). All deadenylases characterized to date belong to either the DEDD or the exonucleaseβ€“endonucleaseβ€“phosphatase (EEP) superfamily (17). In DEDD-type nucleases, the active site consists of three aspartate residues and one glutamate that coordinate two essential divalent metal ions (19β€“21). In humans, members of this group include the POP2, CAF1Z, PARN and PAN2 proteins. The EEP-type nucleases, to which 2β€²-PDE belongs, also depend on divalent metal ions and contain an active site composed of aspartate and histidine residues (22,23). This group comprises enzymes active on both DNA and RNA, and includes the CCR4, Nocturnin and ANGEL proteins.
Here we show that human 2β€²-PDE, unlike other components constituting the 2β€“5A system (24β€“29), is located in the mitochondrial matrix compartment, and comprises a general 3β€²β€“5β€² exoribonuclease exhibiting a preference for oligo-adenosine RNA like canonical cytoplasmic deadenylases (21,22,30β€“33). Furthermore, we document the presence of a marked negative association between 2β€²-PDE and mitochondrial mRNA levels, following siRNA-directed knockdown and plasmid-mediated overexpression, respectively. Collectively, the results suggest that 2β€²-PDE may play a dual role in cells, being involved in mitochondrial RNA turnover as well as the 2-5A system.

2β€²- expression constructs. The cDNA clone DKFZp667B1218 (GenBank accession no. BX647169) was used as template for PCR amplification of the 2β€²-PDE fragments, inserted into either pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pTriEx-3 Neo (Novagen).Cell culturing and transfectionHeLa, HEK293 or COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco BRL/Life Technology) containing 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco BRL/Life Technology). HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected using the PolyFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), and COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed with 1% NP40, 0.5β€‰M CH3COOK containing 2β€‰Γ— Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20β€‰000g for 3β€‰min and the supernatants recovered as protein extracts. Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce).Escherichia coli expression and protein purificationEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with 2β€²-PDE615-His, 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His and OAS1-p42 in pTriEx-3 Neo, and as a control also with empty vector pTriEx-3 Neo. Then the bacteria were grown in LB medium containing 50β€‰Βµg/ml ampicillin before induction at OD600β€‰=β€‰0.8 with 1β€‰mM IPTG for 10β€‰h at 25Β°C. Bacteria were pelleted at 10β€‰000g for 20β€‰min and resuspended in 300β€‰mM KCl, 15% glycerol, 5β€‰mM MgCl2, 5β€‰mM Ξ²-mercaptoethanol, 1β€‰mM PMSF, 1Γ— protease inhibitor cocktail and 50β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.5. This suspension was sonicated and lysed by high-pressure homogenization at 15β€‰000β€“20β€‰000β€‰psi. Cell debris were spun down at 30β€‰000g for 1β€‰h and discarded. For purification, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-ΞΌm filter and applied to a Ni-NTA column (QIAGEN) pre-equilibrated in 300β€‰mM KCl, 20β€‰mM imidazole, 5β€‰mM Ξ²-mercaptoethanol, 1β€‰mM PMSF, 1Γ— protease inhibitor cocktail and 50β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted by a step-gradient using 300β€‰mM imidazole. The Ni-NTA eluate was diluted and applied to a MonoQ HR 16/10 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equlibrated in 50β€‰mM KCl, 5β€‰mM Ξ²-mercaptoethanol and 50β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with a linear KCl gradient of 0.2%/ml going from 50 to 500β€‰mM. Fractions were pooled and concentrated on a 5-kDa MWCO Vivaspin filter (Sartorius), and stored in 50% glycerol.SDSβ€“PAGE and immunoblottingProteins were denatured at 95Β°C for 5β€‰min and applied to 10% SDSβ€“PAGE. Gels were stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Pierce). For immunoblotting, proteins were electro-blotted onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), washed in PBS-T and incubated with anti-His antibodies (Rockland or GenScript Corporation). Membranes were washed in PBS-T and incubated with either of two HRP-conjugated IgGs, goat anti-rabbit antibody (DakoCytomation) or goat anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare). Proteins were detected with the ECL reagent (Amersham ECL PlusTM, GE Healthcare).BioinformaticsThe following online bioinformatic tools were used: WoLF PSORT (http://wolfpsort.org/), pTARGET (http://bioapps.rit.albany.edu/pTARGET/), MitoProt II (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter), PSORT (http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form.html), GPMAW (http://www.gpmaw.com/Downloads/downloads.html), Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/), TopPred (http://www.cbib.u-bordeaux2.fr/pise/toppred.html) and MultiAlin (http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin/multalin.html).ImmunocytochemistryHeLa and HEK293 cells were seeded on coverslips, transfected with PolyFect and incubated for 36β€‰h. The growth media was supplemented with 100β€‰nM Mitotracker (Red CMXRos, Invitrogen) for 30β€‰min. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA, washed in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100, washed again and finally blocked with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. Cells were then incubated with an anti-His antibody (Rockland or Genscript), washed and incubated with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Cells were finally washed, air-dried and the coverslips mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM510 MetaConfocal microscope. The brightness and contrast of the resulting images were adjusted using the LSM Image Software.Synthesis of 2β€²β€“5β€² oligoadenylate tetramer core, ApApApAIn 200β€‰ml, 17β€‰ΞΌg/ml of a highly active 2β€²β€“5β€²-OAS1 was incubated with 2β€‰mM ATP in 4β€‰mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.2β€‰mM DTT, 40β€‰ΒµM EDTA, 0.2β€‰mg/ml Poly(I)-Poly(C), 0.1β€‰mg/ml BSA, 2% glycerol and 4β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.8 for 3β€‰h at 37Β°C. The ATP concentration was increased from 2 to 10β€‰mM by addition of 1β€‰mM ATP every 10β€‰min. The sample was heat-inactivated at 85Β°C for 15β€‰min, filtered (0.45β€‰Βµm) and then applied 100β€‰U/ml alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37Β°C. The sample was then divided into 10β€‰ml aliquots and each aliquot loaded onto a MonoQ HR 16/10 column pre-equilibrated in 20β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with 1 M NaCl using a step-wise linear gradient of 0β€“10% over 3.6-column volumes and 10β€“30% over 24-column volumes. The tetramer oligoadenylate core fractions were then pooled, diluted in 20β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.5, again applied to the MonoQ HR 16/10 column and finally eluted with a step-gradient to 0.5 M NaCl. The identity of the tetramer core was determined by MS and a concentration estimate was obtained by MonoQ Sepharose using ATP as an internal control.Degradation assay and determination of Km and VmaxFor the 2β€²β€“5β€²-linked tetramer, ApApApA, reactions were carried out with 1β€‰pmol/ΞΌl 2β€²-PDE and 0.5β€‰mM substrate in 5β€‰mM MgCl2, 1β€‰mM DTT, 1β€‰mg/ml BSA, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail and 20β€‰mM Hepes, pH 7.0 for 1β€‰h at 37Β°C. The samples were diluted in 20β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.5 and filtered on AcroPrepTM 10K Filter Plates (Pall Corporation). The filtrates were applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 20β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with 1 M NaCl using a step-wise linear gradient of 0β€“12% and 12β€“16% over 18-column volumes and 20-column volumes, respectively. The percentage tetramer core conversion was calculated by integrating the individual peaks.The 2β€²β€“5β€² oligoadenylate degradation assay was repeated with the 3β€²β€“5β€²-linked tetramer substrates, ApApApA and CpCpCpC (Dharmacon), using 1β€‰pmol/Βµl 2β€²-PDE and varying substrate concentrations (25β€‰ΒµMβ€“1.5β€‰mM). Reactions were incubated 20β€‰min at 37Β°C and processed as above by filtration, MonoQ Sepharose fractionation and peak integration. Km and Vmax kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear regression and Michaelisβ€“Menten enzyme kinetics using the GraphPad Prism Software.For the 30-mer RNA- and DNA-degradation assay, the RNAβ€“Poly(A), the RNA Stemloopβ€“Poly(A) and the DNAβ€“Poly(A) substrates were synthesized with a 5β€²-fluorescein label whereas the RNAβ€“Poly(C) substrate was synthesized with a 5β€²-TAMRA label (Invitrogen). All substrates were gel-purified. In vitro reactions contained a 100-fold excess of enzyme (1β€‰ΞΌM) over RNA (10β€‰nM) and were carried out in 50β€‰mM KCl, 7.1β€‰mM MgCl2 and 10β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 8.0. Reactions were incubated at 30Β°C for up to 2β€‰h, quenched with RNA-loading buffer (8β€‰M urea, 0.5% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.5% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF, 20β€‰mM EDTA and 5β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 8.0), separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis on 20% urea-acrylamide gels running at 15β€‰W and the bands visualized with a Typhoon 9400 and Typhoon Trio scanner (GE Healthcare). The RNA and DNA ladders were constructed by limited alkaline hydrolysis of the respective substrates in 50β€‰mM NaCO3, pH 8.9 for 10β€‰min at 96Β°C followed by neutralisation with 300β€‰mM Na(CH3COO), pH 4.5.Differential cell processingCells were harvested in PBS using a cell scraper, pelleted at 1000g for 10β€‰min, resuspended in 220β€‰mM mannitol, 70β€‰mM sucrose, 1β€‰mM EDTA, 2β€‰mg/ml BSA, 2Γ— protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.5β€‰mM PMSF and 20β€‰mM Hepes, pH 7.6, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and the cell debris pelleted at 1000g for 10β€‰min. Recovered supernatants were centrifuged for 20β€‰min at 10β€‰000g, and the pellet (mitochondria) and supernatant (cytosol and microsomes) split up. Mitochondria were resuspended as above but without BSA, and any remaining cell debris pelleted at 1000g for 10β€‰min. The supernatants were centrifuged, again for 20β€‰min at 10β€‰000g, and the resulting mitochondrial pellets resuspended in urea buffer (6 M urea and 50β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 8.0) for MS and gel-fractionation, or 1x OFFGEL Solution (6.7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 60β€‰mM DTT and 1.2% ampholytes, pH 3β€“10) for off-gel fractionation, or BSA Buffer (3β€‰mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, 250β€‰mM sucrose, 80β€‰mM KCl, 5β€‰mM MgCl2, 2β€‰mM KH2PO4, 5β€‰mM methionine and 10β€‰mM MOPSβ€“KOH, pH 7.2) for in vitro mitochondrial import. The cytosol and microsomes were segregated by centrifugation at 330β€‰000g for 30β€‰min and the supernatant (cytosol) TCA-precipitated and resuspended in urea buffer. Mitochondrial protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford assay reagent (Pierce) and the cytosolic protein concentration using the BCA method.35S-labeling and in vitro mitochondrial import35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE615-His was synthesized at 30Β°C for 1.5β€‰h using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). Import reactions were carried out in 1% ethanol, 0.45β€‰mg/ml mitochondria, 1.25β€‰ΞΌl 35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE, 5β€‰mM ATP, pH 7.0 and 10β€‰mM sodium succinate, pH 7.5 in BSA buffer. The membrane potential (Ξ”Ο�) was disrupted by substituting ethanol with 80β€‰ΞΌM antimycin A, 10β€‰ΞΌM valinomycin and 20β€‰ΞΌM oligomycin and leaving out sodium succinate. Reactions were carried out at 30Β°C for different time-points and stopped with 2β€‰mM valinomycin. Non-imported protein was digested for 10β€‰min at 4Β°C using 50β€‰ΞΌg/ml proteinase K followed by inhibition of the protease with 2β€‰mM PMSF at 4Β°C for 10β€‰min. Mitochondria were pelleted as above and washed by resuspension in SEM Buffer (250β€‰mM sucrose, 1β€‰mM EDTA, 2β€‰mM PMSF and 10β€‰mM MOPSβ€“KOH, pH 7.2). The pellets were finally dissolved in sample buffer containing 2β€‰mM PMSF and applied to SDSβ€“PAGE. For the carbonate extraction experiment, mitochondria were exposed to 0.1 M sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) for 30β€‰min on ice after protein import. Samples were then ultracentrifuged at 100β€‰000g for 30β€‰min at 4Β°C and the supernatants (soluble and peripheral membrane proteins) exposed to TCA-precipitation in 125β€‰pg/Βµl sodium deoxycholate. Proteins were finally redissolved in PMSF-containing sample buffer and allowed to solubilize by incubation for 10β€‰min at RT. Ultracentrifuged pellets (integral membrane proteins) were resuspended in sample buffer containing PMSF. For the mitochondrial swelling experiment, mitochondria were resuspended in SM Buffer (250β€‰mM sucrose with 10β€‰mM MOPSβ€“KOH, pH 7.2) after protein import and treated with nine volumes 10β€‰mM MOPSβ€“KOH, pH 7.2 for 15β€‰min on ice, or as a control, kept intact by soaking in nine volumes SM Buffer. Accessible proteins were removed by proteinase K treatment or left untreated as control. The mitochondria/mitoplasts were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed in SEM Buffer and redissolved in sample buffer.For autoradiography, samples were applied to SDSβ€“PAGE and the gel fixed and dried. Proteins were visualized by phosphorimaging using the Typhoon 9400 and Typhoon Trio scanner.Tryptic digest of crude mitochondriaMitochondrial proteins (β�Ό1β€‰mg) dissolved in urea buffer were reduced in 10β€‰mM DTT for 18β€‰h at 37Β°C, then alkylated in 30β€‰mM iodoacetamide for 1β€‰h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding additional DTT to 40β€‰mM. The proteins were diluted 10 times with 1β€‰mM CaCl2 in 10β€‰mM Trisβ€“HCl, pH 8.0, and digested using 5β€‰ng/Βµl trypsin for a period of 18β€‰h at 37Β°C. The pH of samples for MS analysis was adjusted to approximately 2β€“3 with 0.1% TFA.Off-gel fractionation and preparation for MSProteins were off-gel fractionated at 200β€‰V for 25β€‰h (5 kVh) and 50β€‰ΒµA (3100 OFFGEL fractionators, Agilent) into 12 fractions using immobilized pH gradient gel strips covering the pH interval 3β€“10. The fractions were digested with trypsin and the peptides purified by Zip-Tips (0.2β€‰Βµl C18 resin, Millipore). Peptides were finally dried down by SpeedVac centrifugation and redissolved in 0.1% TFA.RP-HPLC and MSSamples were analyzed using the UltiMate 3000 LC system (Dionex) linked to a micrOTOF-Q ESI-Qq-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen). The software Bruker Compass HyStar (Version 3.2-SR2, Bruker Daltonics) was used to link the RP-HPLC and the mass spectrometer controlling software packages. The HPLC used a C18 RP-column (PepMap 100 nanocolumn, Dionex) to fractionate the peptides. Peptides were applied to the column, the column washed in 2% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid and peptides eluted with a linear gradient of 98% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous formic acid. The gradient was run from 0% to 2%, from 2% to 42% and from 42% to 99% over, respectively, 20, 160 and 76β€‰Βµl with a flowrate of 4β€‰Βµl/min. The peptides MS and MS/MS spectra were recorded online by the mass spectrometer.MS sample files were processed, denoted and deconvoluted using DataAnalysis (Version 4.0 SP1, Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The peptide spectra were exported to BioTools (Version 3.1, Bruker Daltonics, Germany) and matched against the peptides resulting from a virtual tryptic digest of 2β€²-PDE. To estimate mitochondrial purity, MS/MS data were applied to the Mascot search engine (Version 2.2, Matrix Science, United Kingdom) and probed against the full repertoire of human proteins contained in the Swiss-Prot protein database. Purities were deduced based on the known cellular localization of the detected proteins.siRNA knockdown and plasmid-mediated overexpression of 2β€²-PDE in HeLa cells, for qRT-PCRA pool of four siRNAs (target sequences: 5β€²-GAAGAUUGAAUUAGCGUGU-3β€², 5β€²-AGUACAAGGUGGAGCGCAA-3β€², 5β€²-CGGCAUCUCUACACGAAGA-3β€² and 5β€²-CAAACUCAGCCUCGAAUUU-3β€²) (Dharmacon) was employed to knockdown the 2β€²-PDE gene expression level (2β€²-PDE ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA). A negative control siRNA was targeting GFP (target sequence: 5β€²-GACGTAAACGGCCACAAGTC-3β€²) (Dharmacon). Plasmid-mediated protein overexpression was done using the 2β€²-PDE615-His construct cloned in pcDNA3.siRNA and plasmid transfections of HeLa cells were carried out in 6-well plates using the DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon) or PolyFect (Qiagen) Transfection Reagents, respectively, according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions. 72 hours (siRNA) and 36β€‰h (plasmid) post-transfections, cells were harvested and the total RNA isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysisFirst-strand cDNA was prepared using 1.5β€‰Βµg total RNA, oligo(dT)18 primer and the MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Epicenter Biotechnologies) in a final volume of 50β€‰Βµl. Each quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR reaction contained 1β€‰Βµl first-strand cDNA and 200β€‰nM of both forward and reverse primers in a final volume of 20β€‰Βµl, and was carried out using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG Kit supplemented with ROX Reference Dye (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primer sets were as follows: 2β€²-PDE forward, 5β€²-GTCATCAATGGCAGCATTCCAGAG-3β€²; 2β€²-PDE reverse, 5β€²-CTATTTCCATTTTAAATCACATACAAGTGC-3β€²; CoxI forward, 5β€²-ACCCTAGACCAAACCTACGCCAAA-3β€²; CoxI reverse, 5β€²-TAGGCCGAGAAAGTGTTGTGGGAA-3β€²; CoxII forward, 5β€²-ACAGATGCAATTCCCGGACGTCTA-3β€²; CoxII reverse, 5β€²-GGCATGAAACTGTGGTTTGCTCCA-3β€²; CoxIII forward, 5β€²-ACTTCCACTCCATAACGCTCCTCA-3β€²; CoxIII reverse, 5β€²-TGGCCTTGGTATGTGCTTTCTCGT-3β€²; CytB forward, 5β€²-TCCTCCCGTGAGGCCAAATATCAT-3β€²; CytB reverse, 5β€²-AAAGAATCGTGTGAGGGTGGGACT-3β€²; ND4 forward, 5β€²-ACAAGCTCCATCTGCCTACGACAA-3β€²; ND4 reverse, 5β€²-TTATGAGAATGACTGCGCCGGTGA-3β€²; ND6 forward, 5β€²-AGGATTGGTGCTGTGGGTGAAAGA-3β€²; ND6 reverse, 5β€²-ATAGGATCCTCCCGAATCAACCCT-3β€²; RPL13A forward, 5β€²-CCTGGAGGAGAAGAGGAAAGAGA-3β€²; RPL13A reverse, 5β€²-TTGAGGACCTCTGTGTATTTGTCAA-3β€². The results were obtained with the Mx3005P System (Stratagene), and the PCR thermocycling conditions were: 95Β°C for 10β€‰min, and 40 cycles of 95Β°C for 10β€‰s, 58Β°C for 20 s and 72Β°C for 20 s. Band sizes of PCR products were verified by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, and the melting-curve analysis of all PCR products displayed single melting peaks. Signal levels were normalized to the ROX reference dye for correction of errors due to differences in plastic-ware transparency and reflectivity, or aliquoting errors. The outcome Ct values were converted to quantities using the comparative Ct method, incorporating the efficiencies of the reaction with each primer set, which were determined as described previously (34). Relative gene expression levels were normalized to values of the RPL13A gene, encoding a stably expressed ribosomal protein (35).

2β€²- contains an -terminal mitochondrial signal peptide. Initially, full-length 2β€²-PDE (609 amino acids) was cloned from human cDNA into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3, to encode a 615 amino acids (68β€‰kDa) fusion protein containing a C-terminal 6Ρ… His-tag (2β€²-PDE615-His) (Figure 1A). After transient transfections, two (HEK293 cells, Figure 1B) or three (HeLa cells, Figure 1C) specific bands were observed corresponding to the full-length protein and either degraded or post-translationally processed products. No degradation was observed upon expression of a control construct containing the 2β€²β€“5β€²-oligoadenylate synthetase, OAS1-p42, suggesting that protein processing could be involved in generating the multiple bands.
Figure 1.Constructs and expression of 2β€²-PDE in human cells. (A) The 2β€²-PDE constructs. 2β€²-PDE615-His encodes the full-length protein added a C-terminal His-tag, whereas 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His makes up an N-terminal truncated form of the 2β€²-PDE615-His devoid of the first 16 residues (vertical arrow in top row) and containing an artificial initiator methionine (M). The EEP-nuclease domain is boxed in red, and the mitochondrial matrix-targeting peptide, mTP in blue. The matrix-targeting R2 motif, xRxβ†“(S/x) and associated proteolytic-cleavage site (MPP) are indicated. Vertical red lines specify the final residue occurring in the natural protein. The initiator methionine in 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His, not present in the native protein, is highlighted in red. MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase. (B) and (C) 2β€²-PDE615-His was transfected into the human HEK293 and HeLa cell lines and protein expression allowed to proceed for 36β€‰h upon which cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody against the His-tag (Rockland). Extracts from cells transfected with a construct encoding His-tagged OAS1-p42 or an empty-pcDNA3 vector (EV) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Arrows indicate the full-length proteins whereas arrowheads specify N-terminally processed forms. Of total protein, 20β€‰Βµg were loaded into each lane.To further analyze the likelihood of protein processing and possibly a sub-cellular localization other than the cytosol, the algorithms WoLF PSORT and pTARGET were used to predict the cellular localization of 2β€²-PDE based on sequence (36). Both clearly identified a mitochondrial signal peptide, also referred to as a matrix-targeting peptide, mTP, in the N-terminus of 2β€²-PDE (37,38). MitoProtII (39), a bioinformatic tool designed specifically for the identification of mTPs as well as the most likely N-terminal processing site confirmed the putative mitochondrial localization with a probability of 95% with the mTP predicted to constitute residues 1β€“16 of the precursor (Figure 1A). Specifically, the N-terminus of 2β€²-PDE contains an R2 motif, xRxβ†“x(S/x), where the arrow marks a proteolytic cleavage site, in this case between Thr16 and Ala17. The presence of an R2 motif in 2β€²-PDE suggests that mitochondrial import proceeds through a single cleavage event mediated by a matrix-localized protease known as mitochondrial processing peptidase, MPP (40). A characteristic feature of mTPs is the presence of an amphipathic Ξ±-helix at the N-terminus of the protein, which gets recognized by membrane-bound import receptors in the mitochondrion (41β€“43). To explore this possibility, GPMAW (44) was used to predict the secondary structure in the N-terminus of 2β€²-PDE and a likely helical element was found covering the initial 27 residues. Helical-wheel analysis subsequently confirmed that the amino acid residues 7β€“24 would be consistent with an amphipathic helix (Supplementary Figure S1).Recombinantly expressed 2β€²-PDE co-localizes with mitochondria in an mTP-dependent fashionPrompted by our bioinformatic discoveries, we next wanted to experimentally confirm the sub-cellular localization of recombinant 2β€²-PDE expressed in human cell lines. Accordingly, the 2β€²-PDE615-His construct was transfected into HeLa cells, and the cells then analyzed by immuno-fluorescence microscopy in which mitochondria were tracked by an organelle-specific stain (Mitotracker) and the 2β€²-PDE by an antibody toward the C-terminal His-tag (Figure 2). The results clearly demonstrated an almost complete co-localization of 2β€²-PDE with mitochondria under these conditions (Figure 2Aβ€“C). His-tagged constructs encoding the known matrix-localized heat shock protein 60, Hsp60 (45) and the non-mitochondrial protein, OAS1-p42 (26) were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. To confirm the significance of the predicted mTP, a variant lacking the expected signal peptide, 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His (Figure 1A) was analyzed in a similar way. This deletion variant showed a uniform distribution throughout the cell, and furthermore was found not to undergo post-translational processing to the same extent as the full-length protein (Figure 2M). Given the detection of an unspecific band in the immunoblot in Figure 2M, it was important to ascertain that cross-reactivity of the anti-His antibody did not hamper the interpretation of the results described in Figure 2Aβ€“L. This was confirmed by conducting parallel immuno-fluorescence analyses on HeLa cells not transfected, in addition to HeLa cells transfected with empty vector pcDNA3, which did reveal no background staining whatsoever (data not shown). Finally, these data defining 2β€²-PDE as a mitochondrial protein were affirmed by similar stainings done on 2β€²-PDE-transfected HEK293 cells, which also showed a mitochondrial distribution of the recombinant protein (Supplementary Figure S2).

(Aβ€“L) Immuno-fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa cells transiently transfected with constructs encoding 2β€²-PDE615-His (Aβ€“C), the His-tagged Hsp60 (Dβ€“F) and OAS1-p42 controls (Gβ€“I) or the 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His deletion variant (Jβ€“L). After 36β€‰h, cells were probed with a His-tag specific antibody (Genscript) and stained with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (green). Mitchondria were visualized by treating live cells with Mitotracker (red). Scale bars; 10β€‰ΞΌm. (M) Immunoblotting on HeLa protein extracts obtained 36β€‰h post-transfection with 2β€²-PDE615-His and 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His using a His-tag specific antibody (Genscript). EV (empty-pcDNA3 vector) was used as a negative control. Arrows specify full-length 2β€²-PDEs, whereas arrowheads mark the β€�intermediateβ€™ (i) and β€�matureβ€™ (m) processed forms of 2β€²-PDE615-His. The asterisks indicate an unspecific band. Of total cell lysate, 20β€‰ΞΌg were loaded into each lane. Note that due to practical reasons the results in Figure 2 were obtained with a different anti-His antibody as compared with the one utilized in Figure 1.In summary, 2β€²-PDE appears to locate to the mitochondria via an mTP-dependent mechanism. The presence of at least three forms of 2β€²-PDE when expressed in HeLa cells suggests that a minimum of two processing events are required to generate the mature, mitochondrial form of 2β€²-PDE, which is most likely represented by the band of lowest molecular mass. The protein forms are therefore denoted β€�precursorβ€™, β€�intermediateβ€™ and β€�matureβ€™, by decreasing size.Recombinant 2β€²-PDE associates with the mitochondrial sub-cellular fractionTo further analyze the complex processing and localization pathway of 2β€²-PDE, COS-7 cells transiently expressing the protein were separated into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions through differential centrifugation of cellular compartments. COS-7 cells were used in this case for practical reasons and are generally assumed to maintain a very homologous mitochondrial import and processing function to the one found in human cells. In this set-up, the full-length form encoded by 2β€²-PDE615-His and the construct lacking the mTP, 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His, were used. If the predicted mTP is indeed functional, the truncated construct should be retained in the cytosol and thus represent an appropriate control that would also validate the purity of the mitochondrial fractions utilized in these experiments. Following a 36β€‰h transient expression, His-tag immunoblotting on the total cell lysate and a mitochondrial fraction clearly showed that the 2β€²-PDE615-His associates with mitochondria (Figure 3A). In contrast, the 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His is not targeted to this organelle, but is exclusively found in the cytosolic fraction (Figure 3B).
Figure 3.Human recombinant and endogenous 2β€²-PDE targets the mitochondria of cells. (A) Immunoblotting on total cell lysate (T) and mitochondrial (M) fractions isolated upon transient expression of 2β€²-PDE615-His for 36β€‰h in COS-7 cells using a His-tag specific antibody (Genscript). (B) Immunoblotting as in (A) on 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His-specific total cell lysate (T), mitchondrial (M) and cytoplasmic (C) samples obtained following 36 h of recombinant expression in COS-7 cells. In (A) and (B), arrows indicate 2β€²-PDEs and asterisks mark unspecific bands. Twenty micrograms of total cell lysate/cytoplasm and 5β€‰Βµg of mitochondrial protein were loaded into the respective lanes. (C) Intrinsic and mitochondrial-specific 2β€²-PDE peptides (red) in HEK293 cells as determined by LC-MS/MS of a tryptic digest prepared from all proteins in off-gel fraction 6 (emphasized in red in Supplementary Figure S4). The detected y-ions (upper red boxes) and b-ions (lower red boxes) are shown, and the Arg(R)/Lys(K) residues underscored in the protein sequence.The identity of the 2β€²-PDE band associated with mitochondria was subsequently confirmed by LC-MS/MS of tryptic peptides prepared from all proteins contained in the mitochondrial fractions. Accordingly, within the 2β€²-PDE615-His-specific sample, twelve peptides were found matching 2β€²-PDE (Supplementary Figure S3), whereas none were identified in the mitochondrial fraction from cells expressing 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His. This is despite a relatively low-estimated mitochondrial purity of β�Ό39% based on the known localization of a wide range of other identified proteins in the samples.Endogenous 2β€²-PDE associates with mitochondriaAs protein expression by transient transfection could potentially produce localization artifacts (46), we decided to check if endogenous 2β€²-PDE also localizes to mitochondria using a similar MS-based approach. In this case, human HEK293 cells were used due to a known high expression level of endogenous 2β€²-PDE (9). Mitochondrial fractions were isolated as before and protein complexity reduced by off-gel isoelectric focusing in the pH interval 3β€“10. In this set-up, a single mitochondrial preparation was split into 12 individual samples distinguished by a difference in pH (Supplementary Figure S4). Individual samples were then treated with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Two peptides specific for 2β€²-PDE were identified in the sample corresponding to a pI of approximately 6, consistent with the predicted pI of 6.11 for full-length 2β€²-PDE (Figure 3C). No 2β€²-PDE-specific peptides were found in the remaining samples. In total, 545 proteins were identified of which 225 represented known mitochondrial proteins yielding a mitochondrial purity of β�Ό41%. Note that in comparison to this HEK293-specific enzymatic identification, no peptides derived from endogenous 2β€²-PDE were identified in the 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His mitochondrial preparation isolated from COS-7 cells (described in the previous section). Specifically, this disparity is likely to be the result of either (1) the fact that the COS-7 sample was not off-gel fractionated prior to LC-MS/MS analyses, or (2) simply that the 2β€²-PDE exhibits differential expression between COS-7 and HEK293 cells.2β€²-PDE synthesized in vitro targets the mitochondrial matrixWe next wanted to analyze the functional significance of the observed mitochondrial localization of 2β€²-PDE by identifying in which mitochondrial sub-compartment, i.e. the outer membrane, the intermembrane space, the inner membrane or the matrix, the protein is located. The presence of the R2-sequence motif immediately suggests that the protein would localize to the matrix, a destination also supported by the sub-cellular prediction tool PSORT (47). In addition, the trans-membrane prediction servers, Phobius (48) and TopPred (49), did not locate any membrane-associated elements, suggesting that 2β€²-PDE most likely is a soluble matrix protein.To confirm this hypothesis, the import of in vitro synthesized, 35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE615-His into mitochondria was studied by incubation of the radioactive protein with organelles obtained from HeLa cells. First, a control time-course experiment was conducted whereby components, i.e. 35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE and mitochondria, were mixed for 2β€“30β€‰min followed by gel-electrophoretic analysis of the mitochondria pre-treated with proteinase K, to reveal the efficiency of import (Figure 4A). In this case, protein bands corresponding to the β€�precursorβ€™, β€�intermediateβ€™ and β€�matureβ€™ forms of 2β€²-PDE appeared over time, showing that 2β€²-PDE615-His is both imported into mitochondria and at the same time undergoes N-terminal processing like seen for the recombinantly expressed protein. Furthermore, mitochondrial import was found to be dependent on the membrane potential across the inner membrane (Ξ”Ο�), which is consistent with a localization to the matrix as only precursor proteins destined for the inner membrane or matrix and in rare cases the intermembrane space, show Ξ”Ο�-dependence during import (50).
Figure 4.Mitochondrial import of radioactively labeled 2β€²-PDE. (A) Time-course experiment in which 35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE615-His and HeLa mitochondria were incubated for 2β€“30β€‰min followed by proteolysis of non-imported proteins by treatment with proteinase K (+PK). The sequestered 35S-labeled proteins were subsequently separated by SDSβ€“PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. Ξ”Ο� indicates whether the mitochondrial membrane potential has been disrupted (β�’) or not (+). The 10% input lane shows the result of in vitro transcription/translation prior to import, and is relative to the total quantity of 35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE added into each import reaction (100%). The arrow marks the position of 2β€²-PDE615-His and arrowheads the location of the processed β€�intermediateβ€™ (i) and β€�matureβ€™ (m) forms. (B). Carbonate extraction experiment in which import was performed as in (A) for 30 and 60β€‰min, after which the mitochondria were split by carbonate extraction into protein fractions containing the integral membrane (P) and the soluble and peripheral membrane parts (S). Specifically, whereas the T lanes provide the total quantity and pattern of 35S-labeled protein after mitochondrial import but prior to carbonate extraction, the 5% input lane presents the 35S-2β€²-PDE615-His-starting material prior to import, and is relative to the amount utilized for each reaction (100%). (C) Osmotic-induced swelling experiment in which mitoplasts (M) were obtained after import for 30 and 60β€‰min by osmotic-induced rupturing of the outer membrane followed by proteolysis (where indicated). The asterisk marks that this PK treatment constitutes the second treatment used to remove accessible proteins upon stripping of the outer membrane. Shown are also the control experiments where the membrane was kept intact (I).We then wanted to clarify whether 2β€²-PDE is part of the soluble mitochondrial proteome represented by the matrix and the intermembrane space, or alternatively, associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane. To analyze this, mitochondria were subjected to carbonate extraction after import of the pre-protein, a technique that allows the separation of soluble and peripheral membrane proteins (S) from integral membrane proteins (P) (51). Specifically, the 35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE615-His was firstly incubated with the mitochondria, this time for 30β€“60β€‰min, upon which the organelles pre-treated with proteinase K were carbonate extracted, and the obtained fractions analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Figure 4B). The results clearly indicated that 2β€²-PDE is present in the soluble phase, i.e. either in the intermembrane space or in the matrix.Osmotic-induced swelling of mitochondria, whereby the outer membrane is burst by lowering the external solute concentration in a mitochondrial suspension while leaving the inner membrane intact, can be used to distinguish matrix proteins from proteins located in the intermembrane space. In this technique, proteins within or facing the intermembrane space become accessible to an external protease, while matrix-located proteins remain shielded. Accordingly, the subsequent isolation and analysis of mitoplasts, the remaining particles comprising the matrix enclosed by the inner membrane, allow for discrimination between intermembrane space and matrix proteins (52). Thus, using mitoplasts isolated from HeLa mitochondria incubated with 35S-labeled 2β€²-PDE615-His for 30β€“60β€‰min, the sub-organellar localization of 2β€²-PDE could be deduced from gel analysis (Figure 4C). The β€�matureβ€™ protein seemed unaffected by protease treatment of the isolated mitoplasts [lanes marked M (mitoplasts) with or without proteinase K treatment], suggesting that 2β€²-PDE is a matrix protein. Although this does not formally exclude that 2β€²-PDE might be partly embedded in the inner membrane with no parts protruding into the intermembrane space, we have already shown that 2β€²-PDE forms part of the soluble mitochondrial phase and therefore conclude that 2β€²-PDE is exclusively a mitochondrial matrix protein.2β€²-PDE contains an EEP-type deadenylase domain and is an active 3β€²β€“5β€² exoribonucleaseSequence analyses show that 2β€²-PDE contains a so-called EEP nuclease domain and hence shares similarity with the cytoplasmic deadenylase families CCR4, Nocturnin and ANGEL (Supplementary Figure S5). To characterize the in vitro deadenylase activity of 2β€²-PDE, the enzyme was heterologously expressed and purified from E. coli. In doing so, the 2β€²-PDE615-His and 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His-encoding templates were firstly subcloned into the IPTG-inducible vector pTriEx-3 Neo, and the constructs transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Then, prior to purification, IPTG-induced lysates expressing 2β€²-PDE615-His and 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His, respectively, were tested for their ability to degrade a 2β€²β€“5β€²-linked adenosine tetramer core (ApApApA) to uncover a potential influence of removing the mTP on enzyme activity. Specifically, the lysates were found to degrade the 2β€²β€“5β€² substrate with similar efficiency, suggesting only a negligible impact (if any) of the mTP on enzyme catalysis (Supplementary Figure S6A). A lysate from cells transformed with an empty-pTriEx-3 Neo vector was used as a control and found to be inactive, in accordance with the fact that 2β€²β€“5β€² RNA is not a natural substrate of any endogenous E. coli enzymes. Immunoblotting was used to confirm that the two constructs expressed equally well in the BL21(DE3) strain (Supplementary Figure S6B).Consequently, based on an unaltered activity response (compared to full-length 2β€²-PDE) the 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His was chosen and purified to homogeneity (Figure 5A), so as to simulate the mature mitochondrial form as far as possible. During the expression and purification of 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His, a stable degradation product of β�Ό45β€‰kDa, referred to as 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His, was also isolated (Figure 5A). Both 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His and its truncated form were active in degradation of 2β€²β€“5β€²-linked substrates, but surprisingly, the truncated protein appeared to be more active than 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His (Figure 5B). Mapping of the N-terminus of 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His by N-terminal sequencing showed that it lacks the first 256 residues compared to 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His, and starts just upstream of the core 2β€²-PDE nuclease domain (Figure 5C). His-tag specific immunoblotting was likewise carried out confirming that in both 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His and 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His, the C-terminal His-tag is preserved (Figure 5D).

The deadenylase Pop2p is only active on 3β€²β€“5β€²-linked RNA and thus constitutes a negative control for 2β€²β€“5β€² oligoadenylate degradation. Reactions were performed in triplicate (mean/SEM) using 10β€‰Βµg of protein. (C) The 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His truncation fragment and comparison to 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His. The five N-terminally sequenced residues of 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His are shown (brown box). (D) Immunoblotting of the 2β€²-PDE proteins from (A) using a His-tag specific antibody (Genscript). A HEK293 total cell lysate expressing the 2β€²-PDE615-His was employed as a positive control. Arrows denote individual proteins and the arrowhead designates the singly processed form of 2β€²-PDE615-His present in the HEK293 cell lysate. Of total protein, 10β€‰Βµg were loaded into each lane.To examine a possible role of 2β€²-PDE in RNA deadenylation, an in vitro degradation assay was set up using defined 30-mer 3β€²β€“5β€²-linked RNA oligos fluorescently labeled at the 5β€²-end (Figure 6A). RNAβ€“Poly(A) substrate contained a 20-residue generic unstructured RNA sequence followed by 10 adenosine residues, while RNA Stemloopβ€“Poly(A) contained an 8-bp strong helical structure followed by 10 adenosine residues (20). The degradation of the substrates by 2β€²-PDE was monitored in time-course experiments carried out with either 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His or 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His using denaturing RNA gels (Figure 6B and C, respectively). When 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His is incubated with RNAβ€“Poly(A), the substrate is removed in a slow and processive manner as seen by the immediate build-up of small RNA fragments of 5β€“8β€‰nt in size, without the appearance of intermediate length RNAs. In contrast, the truncated protein, 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His, initially only removes the poly(A) tail from RNAβ€“Poly(A), as seen by accumulation of completely deadenylated RNAs of 20β€‰nt after β�Ό10β€‰min (Figure 6C). However, upon longer incubation the RNA is degraded into small fragments of 4β€“11β€‰nt in size. 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His also degrades RNAβ€“Poly(C) with reasonable efficiency, demonstrating that 2β€²-PDE is not specific towards adenosine. The RNAβ€“Poly(C) substrate is likewise broken down by 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His, although at a much slower rate compared to the RNAβ€“Poly(A) substrate. These results suggest that 2β€²-PDE confers some degree of sequence preference towards adenosine, yet still possess the ability to degrade other sequences. This behavior is very similar to what is observed for the canonical, cytoplasmic deadenylation enzymes (21). The 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His is not only faster than 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His, but appears to work in a more distributive degradation mode, indicating an inherent functional significance of the N-terminal domain. RNAs containing a strong secondary structure are also processed differently by the two 2β€²-PDE variants. While 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His is able to remove a strong secondary structure element down to fragments of 4β€“5β€‰nt, the short variant, 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His, arrests 2β€‰nt before the stem. This suggests that the N-terminus of 2β€²-PDE contains elements that affect both processivity and secondary structure unwinding of the main exonuclease domain, most likely through an RNA-binding domain. Unfortunately, bioinformatics did not seem to support this notion, suggesting that if present, this RNA-binding domain of 2β€²-PDE may substantially deviate from known RNA-binding regions. None of the 2β€²-PDE variants were able to degrade a 2β€²-deoxy substrate, DNAβ€“Poly(A), which is equivalent to RNAβ€“Poly(A) but on the DNA form. Furthermore, a BL21(DE3)-specific protein fraction obtained from cells transformed with an empty-pTriEx-3 Neo vector and purified according to the same parameters as used for the 2β€²-PDEs was inactive on all RNA substrates (data not shown), strongly suggesting that any contaminating traces of co-purified nuclease activity is unlikely to contribute to the results seen in Figure 6.

(B and C) Time-course degradation assays where purified 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His (B) or 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His (C) were incubated with defined RNAs (or DNA where specified) at 30Β°C for the indicated amount of minutes. The DNAβ€“Poly(A) oligomer was similar to the RNAβ€“Poly(A) but on the DNA form. Ladder is a single-nucleotide ladder produced by limited alkaline hydrolysis of the substrates. Control lanes specify reactions in which the RNAs (or DNA) were incubated for 120β€‰min at 30Β°C in the absence of enzyme.In conclusion, 2β€²-PDE exhibits a general 3β€²β€“5β€² riboexonucleolytic activity with a subtle preference for adenosine like that observed for the canonical deadenylases.2β€²-PDE degrades 3β€²β€“5β€²-linked RNA with a preference for adenosineTo address the apparent preference for adenosine further, two 3β€²β€“5β€²-linked substrates (ApApApA, oligo-A and CpCpCpC, oligo-C) were used to determine Michaelisβ€“Menten Km and Vmax values for 2β€²-PDE. Both 2β€²-PDEΞ”mTP600-His and 2β€²-PDEΞ”N344-His were able to degrade these short substrates completely down to a nucleoside (adenosine or cytidine, respectively) and a 5β€²-monophosphate nucleotide (AMP or CMP, respectively) as judged by the chromatographic analyses of products and determination of peak ratios (β�Ό1:3) (Supplementary Figure S7). For both 2β€²-PDE forms, the Km on oligo-A is approximately half of that measured for oligo-C with a Vmax 1.4β€“1.7-fold higher for the oligo-A substrate (Table 1). Thus, 2β€²-PDE both has a higher affinity and activity for polyadenosine 3β€²β€“5β€²-linked RNA and therefore closely matches the substrate specificity of cytosolic deadenylases, defined as 3β€²β€“5β€² exoribonucleases that prefer RNAs composed of adenosines (21).

The Km and Vmax parameters were derived by non-linear regression using the GraphPad Prism Software. All reactions were performed in triplicate and is shown as meanΒ±SEM.A negative correlation exists between 2β€²-PDE and mitochondrial mRNA expression levelsTo elucidate if 2β€²-PDE is functionally involved in mitochondrial RNA turnover, either as an RNA deadenylase or alternatively as a general RNA decay enzyme, HeLa cells were transfected with a mix of four 2β€²-PDE siRNAs to downregulate the natural protein. 72 hours post-transfection, total cellular RNA was then obtained and qRT-PCR performed to evaluate an effect of 2β€²-PDE knockdown on chosen mitochondrial mRNAs, i.e. the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CoxI), CoxII, CoxIII, cytochrome b (CytB), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) and ND6. Specifically, down-regulation of 2β€²-PDE by β�Ό50% was found not to evoke any statistical differences in mitochondrial mRNA expression levels, compared with cells transfected with a GFP control siRNA (Figure 7A). Despite hereof, the results seemed to indicate a slight negative correlation between 2β€²-PDE and mitochondrial mRNAs, suggesting that 2β€²-PDE may ultimately act to destabilize these RNAs.
Figure 7.2β€²-PDE destabilizes mitochondrial mRNAs. qRT-PCR analyses of mitochondrial mRNAs following (A) siRNA knockdown, or (B) plasmid-mediated overexpression, of 2β€²-PDE in HeLa cells. In (A), cells were transfected with a pool of 2β€²-PDE siRNAs and incubated for 72β€‰h prior to performing qRT-PCR analysis. Cells transfected with a GFP-specific siRNA were used as a negative control. In (B), 2β€²-PDE615-His transfectants were analyzed by qRT-PCR 36β€‰h post-transfection. Cells treated with empty vector (EV) pcDNA3 were employed as a negative control. (A and B) Relative expression was calculated by normalization to RPL13A expression levels followed by gene-specific normalization, setting the controls to 1. Data are averages of triplicate qRT-PCR reactions, and the error bars denote standard deviations. Both experiments were repeated three times, each time with similar results. Asterisks denote those mRNAs exhibiting differential expression.In order to test and validate this hypothesis, the full-length 2β€²-PDE615-His construct (in pcDNA3) was transfected into HeLa cells and the protein overexpressed for a period of 36β€‰h. Any given effect of 2β€²-PDE on mitochondrial mRNAs was then evaluated by qRT-PCR as above. Overexpression of the 2β€²-PDE was found to markedly destabilize mitochondrial mRNAs, compared with cells transfected with control empty vector pcDNA3 (Figure 7B). Specifically, three of the six mRNAs were significantly down-regulated, counting the CoxI (28%β†“), CoxIII (34%β†“) and CytB (32%β†“) mRNAs. The remaining mRNAs were only insignificantly reduced. Collectively, these data therefore put forward the 2β€²-PDE as a likely catabolic player involved in mitochondrial RNA turnover.

uman 2β€²- is thought to control the cellular level of 2-5s through specific degradation, thereby acting as a negative regulator of the -induced 2-5 system (9). n this article, we present strong evidence that the enzyme contains an -terminal mitochondrial signal peptide and possesses a sub-cellular localization to the mitochondrial matrix. t present, two matrix-localized peptidases,  and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (), are known to participate in maturation of mitochondrial proteins (53).  small number of nuclear-encoded proteins are matured through sequential cleavage by  and  (54). he appearance of an intermediate-sized 2β€²- band in e. La cells could suggest that 2β€²-PDE undergoes such two-step maturation. Sequential maturation of precursor proteins occur through recognition of the R10 motif, xRx|(F/L/I)xx(S/T/G)xxxxβ†“, where the vertical line and arrow indicate the cleavage sites for MPP and MIP, respectively (40). Thus MPP leaves an intermediate with an N-terminal octapeptide extension which is subsequently removed by MIP (54,55). However, two findings indicate that the final step in maturation of 2β€²-PDE is not catalyzed by MIP. First, an R2 motif, specific for MPP and not MIP rather than the R10 motif was found in 2β€²-PDE. Second, the size difference between the β€�intermediateβ€™ and β€�matureβ€™ forms of β�Ό7β€‰kDa is not compatible with the removal of an octapeptide (β�Ό1β€‰kDa). It is therefore possible that the second cleavage event in maturation of 2β€²-PDE results from the activity of a yet unidentified peptidase (56,57). Three similar forms of 2β€²-PDE have previously been observed in human cells, but in this case the phenomenon was ascribed to the usage of alternate translation start codons triggered by β€�weakβ€™ Kozak signals (9). Specifically, the Kozak consensus for initiation of translation in vertebrates is: (G/A)CCATGG (58). In this sense, a β€�strongβ€™ Kozak signal contains a purine (either G or A) at position β�’3 and a G nucleotide at position +4 relative to the adenine of the ATG initiator positioned at +1 (there is no number 0 position). Further, an β€�adequateβ€™ consensus contains only one of these sites, while a β€�weakβ€™ consensus has neither. Indeed the genome sequence around the ATG start codon in 2β€²-PDE, TTCATGT, represents a β€�weakβ€™ Kozak signal, thus rendering this ATG triplet prone to ribosome skipping. However, the presence of a β€�strongβ€™ Kozak sequence at the second ATG triplet, GCGATGG, encoding Met35 makes ribosome skipping at this position highly unlikely. Furthermore, even though an ATG codon at Met35 is in accordance with the observed size difference between the β€�precursorβ€™ and the β€�intermediateβ€™ form (2β€“4β€‰kDa), the next ATG triplet found at Met63 is not compatible with the β�Ό7β€‰kDa that separates the β€�intermediateβ€™ and β€�matureβ€™ band. Consequently, we argue that the appearance of three 2β€²-PDE forms results from protein processing, and not the usage of alternate translation start codons.
The observed localization of 2β€²-PDE to the mitochondrial matrix immediately seemed puzzling in light of its known role within the predominant nuclear- and cytosolic-based 2-5A system, suggesting an additional more mitochondria-specific activity of this enzyme (24β€“29). Based on both a functional and structural similarity of 2β€²-PDE to RNA deadenylases, this might very well be in mitochondrial RNA turnover (9,15β€“17). The current finding of an inverse relationship between 2β€²-PDE and mitochondrial mRNA expression levels, supports this hypothesis and demonstrates that 2β€²-PDE may act to degrade these RNAs. Whether this is the result of a principal role in RNA deadenylation or in general RNA decay, however, remains to be elucidated.
In human mitochondria, both RNA deadenylation and general RNA decay remains an unresolved issue (59,60). Previously, mammalian polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) was suggested to be responsible for RNA deadenylation in mitochondria (61). However, the discovery that PNPase is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and that knockdown does not affect RNA levels inside the matrix compartment, recently questioned this hypothesis (59). The data reported here defining 2β€²-PDE as a general 3β€²β€“5β€² exoribonuclease with some preference for adenosine, is compatible to what is seen for most deadenylases, and therefore consistent with a role in RNA deadenylation (21,22,30β€“33). For instance, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bulk of cytoplasmic deadenylation is maintained by the Ccr4 subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex (62), a large complex composed of seven core proteins including two deadenylases (Ccr4 and Pop2p) (63,64). In vitro, both Ccr4 and Pop2p nucleases show a preference for poly(A)-containing substrates, yet are able to degrade other sequences as well (21,22,33). Like many RNA-degrading enzymes, it is possible that 2β€²-PDE associates with other proteins in vivo inside the mitochondria that more precisely defines its substrates, but this is at present pure speculation.
In contrast to the exclusive stabilizing effect imposed by poly(A) tails added to cytoplasmic mRNAs, the poly(A) tail of human mitochondrial mRNAs is known to provide both stability and instability to the RNA, the outcome being dictated by the exact site of poly(A) addition (61,65,66). Specifically, human mitochondrial mRNAs can be poly(A) modified by (i) internal polyadenylation subsequent to endonucleolytic RNA cleavage, or (ii) by β€�normalβ€™ polyadenylation taking place at the mature 3β€² termini. In the former case, transcripts are marked to be degraded, whereas in the latter, they are stabilized. Suppose 2β€²-PDE carries out mitochondrial RNA deadenylation, which poly(A) tails, i.e. the internal added tails or the mature 3β€² terminal tails, then constitute the main target for 2β€²-PDE. Though this of course remains speculative, the capacity of 2β€²-PDE to destabilize and down-regulate mitochondrial mRNAs would be consistent with a role in processing of the mature 3β€²-terminal tails, normally known to stabilize their RNA targets. On the contrary, 2β€²-PDE could also, or exclusively, be processing the internal added tails, and by this means cause RNA destabilization.
As stated, the 2β€²-PDE needs not be delimited to a molecular role in RNA deadenylation, but might alternatively be generally involved in the degradation of entire mitochondrial RNAs. For instance, in yeast where mitochondrial RNAs, remarkably, are not polyadenylated (67), RNA decay is maintained by a large enzyme machinery termed the β€�mitochondrial degradosomeβ€™ containing RNA helicase (Suv3p) and 3β€²β€“5β€² exoribonuclease (Dss1p) activities (68,69). Based on similar properties recognized here for the 2β€²-PDE, i.e. a general 3β€²β€“5β€² exoribonuclease activity combined with the ability to unwind secondary structures, human mitochondrial RNAs may indeed be processed by this enzyme.
As for its role in the 2-5A system, we speculate that the 2-5A core molecules and not their 5β€²-phosphorylated variants, are the natural substrates for 2β€²-PDE. First, viral infection prompts the accumulation of 2-5A core moleculesβ€”not 2-5Asβ€”to levels of micromolar magnitudes suggesting that a 5β€²-phosphatase initiates 2-5A catabolism (11,70). Second, the dephosphorylated and hence less charged 2-5A core molecules are more likely to passively traverse the hydrophobic barrier formed by the mitochondrial inner membrane (71,72). Alternatively, if not translocated by diffusion, a membrane-positioned 2-5A core solute-carrier, akin to the ADP/ATP antiporter, may exist and transport 2-5A core molecules into the mitochondrial matrix. Finally, the micromolar Km values estimated for 2β€²-PDE on the phosphorylated 2β€²β€“5β€² substrates (15) are much higher compared to the nanomolar 2-5A levels sufficient for activating RNase L (12), indicating that a 5β€²-phosphatase indeed performs the initial cleavage in the overall 2-5A catabolism.
Based on these findings, we present a model (Figure 8) that besides accounting for the complete 2-5A catabolism includes a mechanism of how the cellular 2-5A level is regulated following viral exposure. In this scheme, RNase L and a 5β€²-phosphatase are both activated by 2-5A levels in the nanomolar range to (i) relieve cells of viral infection and (ii) to protect against the cytotoxic events resulting from build-up of 2-5As. Accordingly, when raised to nanomolar levels, 2-5As not only stimulate RNase L, but are simultaneously converted into the less cell-toxic 2-5A core molecules. The resulting β€�coresβ€™ then concentrate to micromolar levels and are transported across the mitochondrial inner membrane into the matrix where they function as substrates for 2β€²-PDE. Notice that despite here having defined 2β€²-PDE as a mitochondrial protein, the possible occurrence of any non-mitochondrial forms hereof, e.g. arising by alternative splicing creating isoforms devoid of an N-terminal mTP, can at present not be excluded. Specifically, as the properties of such variants would be expected to be very similar to that of the mitochondrial protein, the 2-5A core molecules should also constitute their primary substrates. The hypothetical presence of non-mitochondrial 2β€²-PDEs were included in Figure 8, to illustrate yet a factor potentially involved in 2-5A catabolism.
Figure 8.The 2-5A systemβ€”regulation and catabolism. Normally, the cellular concentration of 2-5As is kept below the nanomolar range (10,73), maintaining the pathway in an inactive state. Then, when increased to nanomolar levels by the IFN-induced 2β€²β€“5β€²-OASs, 2-5As activate RNase L and a 5β€²-phosphatase, which results in the degradation of viral RNA and in the conversion of the cytotoxic 2-5As into dephosphorylated 2-5A core molecules. Accumulation of 2-5A core molecules to micromolar concentrations subsequently result in transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane and into the matrix by a yet unidentified mechanism. Within the mitochondrial matrix, 2β€²-PDE completes 2-5A catabolism by degradation of the incoming 2-5A core molecules. The 2-5A catabolic pathway is specified by red arrows, and the possible involvement of yet to be discovered non-mitochondrial 2β€²-PDEs (2β€²-PDE?) is illustrated by a red dotted arrow.
In conclusion, we have shown that 2β€²-PDE, a down-regulator of the cytoplasmic 2-5A system, comprises a matrix-localized mitochondrial protein very likely also to be involved in organellar RNA turnover. Whether this role is in general RNA decay or in RNA deadenylation remains to be determined.
