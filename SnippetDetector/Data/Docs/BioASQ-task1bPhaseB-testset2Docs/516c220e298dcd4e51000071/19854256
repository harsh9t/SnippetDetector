ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cucumis trigonus Roxb. (Cucurbitaceae) fruit is used in the Indian traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Based on a number of reports on the blood glucose level reduction and the other complications of diabetes associated with some Cucurbitaceae plants, the antidiabetic effect of Cucumis trigonus fruit was investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the antidiabetic action of the aqueous extract of Cucumis trigonus fruits in the different models of rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antidiabetic activity of aqueous extract of Cucumis trigonus fruit was evaluated by using normal and streptozotocin-induced-diabetic rats. The acute effect of aqueous extract was evaluated by administering 500 mg/kg p.o. to normoglycemic rats. In the chronic model, the aqueous extract was administered to normal and STZ-induced-diabetic rats at dose of 500 mg/kg p.o. per day for 21 days. Blood glucose levels and body weights were monitored at specific intervals and different biochemical parameters were also carried out. RESULTS: The statistical data indicated the significant increase in the body weight, liver glycogen and serum insulin level and decrease in the blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, total cholesterol and serum triglycerides. HDL cholesterol level was significantly increased when treated with the extract. CONCLUSION: The aqueous fruit extract of Cucumis trigonus has had beneficial effects in reducing the elevated blood glucose level and lipid profile of STZ-induced-diabetic rats.
