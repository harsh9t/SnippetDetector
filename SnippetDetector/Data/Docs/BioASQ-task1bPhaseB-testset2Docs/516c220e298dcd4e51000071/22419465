OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sea cucumber cerebroside(SCC) and its long-chain base(LCB) on lipid and glucose metabolism in obese mice. METHODS: The mouse obese model was established by feeding high fat diet. The mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group, model group, SCC group and LCB group. After 4 weeks, the glucose tolerance test was undertaken. After 5 weeks, the body fat content, organic indexes, serum lipid level, glycemic index and liver lipid level were determined. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the glucose tolerance in the SCC group and LCB group was ameliorated significantly (P<0.01, P<0.05); glycemic index (P<0.01, P<0.01), the weight of adipose tissue (P<0.05, P<0.01) and the hepatic TG were reduced significantly (P<0.05, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Sea cucumber cerebroside and its long-chain base can improve the glucose and lipid metabolism in obese mice.
