The regulatory role of protein kinase C (PKC) in glycogen metabolism in pectin fed rats was investigated. Administration of pectin (5 g/kg body wt/day) from cucumber (Cucumis sativius L.) led to inhibitory effects on PKC activity in the liver of rats. In the brain and pancreas, PKC activity was significantly higher in pectin-treated rats as compared to the control group. Level of blood glucose was significantly lowered and the level of glycogen in the liver was significantly increased in pectin-administered rats. Glycogen synthase activity was enhanced, while glycogen phosphorylase enzyme showed inhibition in pectin-treated rats. Results indicated that pectin administration might have caused an increase in the secretion of the insulin, which, in turn, had a stimulatory effect on the PKC activity in the pancreas. The decreased PKC activity in the liver and increased PKC activity in the brain and pancreas on pectin administration indicated enhanced glycogenesis and reduced glycogenolysis.
