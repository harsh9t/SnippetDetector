Nine markers from the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17 were typed in 16 British and five South African families with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The markers--p17H8, pHHH202, and EW204--were linked to NF1 at recombination fractions less than 1%. No evidence of locus heterogeneity was detected. Inspection of recombinant events in families informative for several markers suggests that the NF1 gene is located between the markers EW301 (cen-p11.2) and EW206 (cen-q12) and possibly distal to pHHH202 (q11.2-q12).
