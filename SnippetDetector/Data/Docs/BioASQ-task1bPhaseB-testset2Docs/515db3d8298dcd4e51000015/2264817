The critical concentration required for filament assembly in vitro from highly purified desmin was determined by both turbidity and centrifugation assays. Assembly was done in the presence of 2 mM-Ca2+, 2 mM-Mg2+ or 150 mM-Na+ at 2, 22 and 37 degrees C. Similar values for critical concentration were obtained by both assays. As temperature increased, critical concentration decreased for each cation. The critical concentration was lowest in the presence of Ca2+ at 2, 22 and 37 degrees C, but was highest in the presence of 150 mM-Na+ at 2 degrees C. Negative staining showed that supernatants from the centrifugation assays contained protofilaments, protofibrils and short particles (less than 300 nm), but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average diameter of 10 nm. As the temperature increased, both the average diameter and average length of particles in the supernatant increased. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that hydrophobic interactions were dominant during desmin assembly, but that ionic interactions might also be involved. Our results demonstrated that the specific cation and temperature and temperature-cation interactions all are important in assembly of desmin intermediate filaments.
