PURPOSE: To report a case of corneal endothelial deposits associated with rifabutin therapy for Crohn's disease. METHOD: Case report, anterior segment photography, and current literature search. RESULTS: Persistence of corneal endothelial deposits was found to occur in a 55-year-old gentleman 6 years after cessation of a 3-year course of rifabutin. The corneal deposits were not associated with lenticular findings or retinal dysfunction, the latter side effect being published in a recent research article. CONCLUSIONS: This is only the second published case of corneal deposits in conjunction with rifabutin therapy for Crohn's disease. This case uniquely confirms the persistence of the corneal deposits longer than previously documented.
