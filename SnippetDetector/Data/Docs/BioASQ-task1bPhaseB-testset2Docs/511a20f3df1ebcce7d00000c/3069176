It has been suggested that cyclosporin A might be of some benefit to patients with Crohn's disease. The clinical response and side-effects of cyclosporin A in Crohn's disease are described in a series of 13 adults. The majority of patients had ileal disease and all but one were started on an initial oral dose of 15 mg/kg per day. Duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 42 weeks. Of the 13 patients, 6 showed a response to therapy; the remainder showed no response or deteriorated. The commonest side-effect was hyperaesthesia, but one patient developed nephrotoxicity and one developed hepatotoxicity. Significant drug malabsorption occurred in one case. The side-effects were dose dependent and reversible. Cyclosporin A may have a part to play in the treatment of resistant Crohn's disease, and in our hands has been associated with a 46 per cent response rate; however, the precise role of cyclosporin A in the management of Crohn's disease awaits further study.
