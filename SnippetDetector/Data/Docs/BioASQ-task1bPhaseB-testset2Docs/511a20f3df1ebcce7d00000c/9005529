Pericarditis and myocarditis are rare extraintestinal manifestations of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). Pericarditis as a side effect induced by sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, drugs used in the therapy of these diseases, was first described only 7 years ago. In older case reports the relationship between the use of these drugs and pericarditis is unclear. We analyze the reported cases of 68 patients (38 men, 24 women) with ulcerative colitis (n = 45) or Crohn's disease (n = 15) who had one or more episodes of pericarditis or myopericarditis. Pericarditis was not associated with high activity of bowel disease in all cases. In most cases therapy with corticosteroids led to uneventful recovery. In drug induced pericarditis omission of the 5-ASA therapy was sufficient in a few cases. There was one fatal case (with myocarditis). The decision whether pericarditis is a symptom of the underlying disease or a side effect of the drug used for the treatment of the disease is not always easy. We present an analysis (clinical problem solving) of a pertinent observation in a patient with Crohn's disease and pericarditis, showing the dilemma of pericarditis in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and its therapy.
