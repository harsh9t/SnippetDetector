Myopericarditis is a rare extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has also been described as a side-effect of the treatment of IBD. We report a 37-year-old-woman with Crohn's disease who had several mild episodes of myopericarditis, two of which were associated with a pleural effusion, and two with conduction abnormalities in the atrioventricular node. During the last episode, a nodal rhythm was followed by a third-degree atrioventricular block and a prolonged pause, resulting in loss of consciousness and convulsions. A permanent pacemaker was implanted. Our patient is also human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) B27-positive. HLA B27 is known to be associated with conduction disturbances in the AV node. Recurrent myopericarditis can be a sign of IBD.
