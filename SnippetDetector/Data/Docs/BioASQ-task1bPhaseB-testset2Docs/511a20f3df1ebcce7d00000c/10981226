Azathioprine and 5-aminosalicylic-acid are used to treat patients with Crohn's disease. It is well known that both drugs are able to cause pancreatitis as a side effect. This is discussed in the light of a new case report where a patient developed acute pancreatitis following treatment with mesalazine, and again after discontinuation when initiating azathioprine.
