OBJECTIVE: Azathioprine (AZA) is frequently used in Crohn's disease (CD) therapy. This paper aimed to evaluate the frequency, evolution and management of AZA side effects in CD patients. METHODS: One hundred and six CD patients under AZA therapy were evaluated prospectively from January 2002 to December 2006. Clinical and demographic data were recorded, together with a monthly laboratory control of hematological or other adverse reactions by means of clinical evaluation. Comparison was carried out between groups with and without side effects. RESULTS: At least one adverse reaction was found in 56 (52.7%) of the patients studied and required a transient drug reduction; 18 (17%) had to definitely stop use of AZA, often because of hypersensitivity reactions. Nausea, vomit, although slight, occurred in 29 (27.4%). The black race and those with co-morbidities had more gastric intolerance than Caucasians and those without other associated disease (p=0.04). Leucopoenia was the more frequent side effect observed, occurring in 36 (34%). The period of AZA use was longer for patients with leucopoenia than for those without (p=0.001), while the mean dose of AZA was lower for those with leucopoenia when compared to non-leucopoenics (p=0.005). No serious infections, malignancy or death was noticed as a consequence of AZA use. CONCLUSION: In this study use of AZA in therapy for Crohn's disease disclosed that the drug is satisfactorily safe as long as periodical clinical and laboratory supervision is carried out during treatment.
