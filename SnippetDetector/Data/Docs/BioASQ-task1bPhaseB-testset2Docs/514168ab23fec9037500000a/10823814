Unlike normal mammalian cells, which use oxygen to generate energy, cancer cells rely on glycolysis for energy and are therefore less dependent on oxygen. We previously observed that the c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor regulates lactate dehydrogenase A and induces lactate overproduction. We, therefore, sought to determine whether c-Myc controls other genes regulating glucose metabolism. In Rat1a fibroblasts and murine livers overexpressing c-Myc, the mRNA levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase were elevated. c-Myc directly transactivates genes encoding GLUT1, phosphofructokinase, and enolase and increases glucose uptake in Rat1 fibroblasts. Nuclear run-on studies confirmed that the GLUT1 transcriptional rate is elevated by c-Myc. Our findings suggest that overexpression of the c-Myc oncoprotein deregulates glycolysis through the activation of several components of the glucose metabolic pathway.
