Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a myasthenia-like syndrome of paraneoplastic origin which is often associated with anaplastic small-cell lung cancer. It seems to be an autoimmune disease responsible for a deficit of acetylcholine ejection in the motor end plate. On the occasion of two recent cases, we review the clinical, physiopathological and diagnostic aspects of this paraneoplastic syndrome.
