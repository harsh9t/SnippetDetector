BACKGROUND: To enhance the acknowledgement of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Retrospective case analysis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer in our hospital. RESULTS: The characteristics of electromyography for Lambert-Eaton syndrome was reduction in action potential amplitude after repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation at low frequency and increased amplitude at high frequency.There were 10 cases of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in 332 pathologically diagnosed small cell lung cancer,9 male and 1 female with an average age of 57.6Â±4.9.Nine of 10 cases were among 50 to 69.All patients except one experienced myasthenia,mainly in lower extremities,2 to 36 months (median:6 months) before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.Treatment of small cell lung cancer may improve the symptoms of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Improving the recognition of Lambert-Eaton syndrome may be helpful to identify early small cell lung cancer and improve the prognosis,as the symptom of muscular weakness usually appears early before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.
