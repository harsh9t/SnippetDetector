Plasma and IgG obtained from 10 Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LES) patients (5 with carcinoma, 5 without associated cancer), 6 healthy subjects, and 1 patient with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) were examined in their ability to recognize chromaffin cell antigens on Western blots. The pattern of antigen recognition was compared with the magnitude of inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium and sodium currents recorded with the patch-clamp technique from chromaffin cells. Eight of the 11 patients with LES and/or SCLC recognized plasma membrane proteins and 9 of the patients' IgG interacted with cytoplasmic antigens with no apparent pattern of antigen recognition between patients. Also, there was no obvious band pattern distinguishing patients with LES from those with LES and concurrent SCLC. Eighty percent of the LES patients' antibodies were capable of reducing the calcium current (ICa) in chromaffin cells. One of the novel findings of this study is that 30% of the patients had produced antibodies which were able to inhibit both calcium and sodium currents (INa). The heterogeneous response of the IgG on the Western blots does not appear to correlate with the efficacy of reducing the inward currents.
