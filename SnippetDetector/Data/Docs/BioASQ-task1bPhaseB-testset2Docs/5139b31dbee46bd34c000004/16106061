Abnormal immunoglobulin synthesis within the central nervous system is a common finding in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) that is often used for diagnosis. However, it is not clear whether antibodies, or the B-cells and plasma cells that make them, are critical to the pathogenesis of MS. Here we review the descriptive data that suggest a role for antibody in the pathogenesis of MS. The results of B-cell and antibody depletion studies in the animal model for MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, are summarized, as well as early data using a chimeric monoclonal antibody to deplete B-cells in patients with MS.
