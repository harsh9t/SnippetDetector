To assess neurological impairments quantitatively in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), we have used a targeted model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which leads to the formation of anatomically defined lesions in the spinal cord. Deficits in the hindlimb locomotion are therefore well defined and highly reproducible, in contrast to the situation in generalized EAE with disseminated lesions. Behavioral tests for hindlimb sensorimotor functions, originally established for traumatic spinal cord injury, revealed temporary or persistent deficits in open field locomotion, the grid walk, the narrow beam and the measurement of the foot exorotation angle. Such refined behavioral testing in EAE will be crucial for the analysis of new therapeutic approaches for MS that seek to improve or prevent neurological impairment.
