OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between intra-amniotic bleeding and fetal echogenic bowel. METHODS: Comprehensive fetal ultrasound examinations were done before and 12 hours after fetal transfusions. Follow-up ultrasound examinations were done weekly in 28 fetuses with intra-amniotic bleeding. Hyperechogenic bowel was diagnosed when the echogenicity of fetal bowel was similar to that of bone. Postpuncture bleeding was identified when a stream of echogenic material from the cord into the amniotic space was seen, lasting at least 60 seconds. RESULTS: None of the fetuses had echogenic bowel before initial transfusions. Intra-amniotic bleeding was followed by bowel echogenicity in seven of 28 fetuses within the first 12 hours after bleeding episodes. Echogenic bowel remained in five fetuses 2 weeks after the bleeding episodes. In three fetuses, echogenic bowel was still seen 4 weeks later. CONCLUSION: Intra-amniotic bleeding can lead to echogenic bowel.
