OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of certain etiologies in fetal echogenic bowel and the related pregnancy outcome. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study including 215 cases. Ultrasound findings included bowel abnormality, malformations, growth retardation and Doppler abnormalities. Amniocentesis was performed in 196 cases to screen for abnormalities in karyotype, cystic fibrosis gene and infection. The color of amniotic fluid and a history of first-trimester bleeding were also noted. Outcome according to different etiologies was reported. RESULTS: 112 cases (57%) had a known etiology, which included chromosomal abnormality (7%), infection (4%), cystic fibrosis (1.5%), bowel abnormality (3%), bleeding or stained amniotic fluid (11%), Doppler abnormality (14%), malformation (16%) and miscellaneous (0.5%). Pregnancy was terminated in 39 cases and fetal demise complicated one third of the cases (13) of severe growth retardation. CONCLUSION: Fetal echogenic bowel should be investigated and a careful follow-up is necessary if there is associated Doppler perturbation or growth retardation.
