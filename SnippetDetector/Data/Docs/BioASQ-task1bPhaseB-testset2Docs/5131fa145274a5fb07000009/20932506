OBJECTIVE: Pregnancies medical follow-up and ultrasonography development have enabled detection of fetal echogenic bowel, a sign associated with various pathologies, including cystic fibrosis. Based on the long experience of a region where cystic fibrosis is frequent (Brittany, France), we describe disorders diagnosed in fetal echogenic bowel fetuses and assess ultrasonography ability in detecting cystic fibrosis in utero. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the cases of fetal echogenic bowel diagnosed in pregnant women living in Brittany and referred for CFTR gene analysis over the 1992-2007 period (n = 289). RESULTS: A disorder was diagnosed in 32.2% of the fetuses, cystic fibrosis being the most commonly identified (7.6%). We also found digestive malformations (7.0%), chromosomal abnormalities (3.7%), and maternofetal infections (3.7%). Combining these data with our ongoing newborn screening program since 1989 showed that ultrasonography enabled diagnosis of 10.7% of the cystic fibrosis cases. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of pregnancy ultrasound examinations and their efficiency in detecting cystic fibrosis.
