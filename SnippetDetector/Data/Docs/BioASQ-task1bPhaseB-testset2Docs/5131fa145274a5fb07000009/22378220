INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the association between fetal echogenic bowel (FEB) diagnosed during the second trimester and adverse perinatal outcomes in an Australian antenatal population. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of ultrasound scans was performed between March 1, 2004 and March 1, 2009 at The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Vic., Australia. Cases reported as having FEB on second trimester ultrasound were included. Medical records of each case were reviewed and information concerning additional investigations and perinatal outcomes were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 66 cases were identified in our database. Three patients (5%) were excluded from further analysis as they were lost to follow-up, leaving 63 (95%) cases in this series. Thirty-two fetuses (52%) underwent karyotyping via amniocentesis, 5 (16%) of which were found to have chromosomal defects. Maternal serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was performed in 49 (78%) cases. Investigations indicated a total of 5 women who had CMV infection during their pregnancy. Thirty-three pregnancies (53%) were tested for cystic fibrosis (CF) and 1 baby was confirmed to have CF postnatally. Among the 50 liveborn infants, 3 cases of fetal growth restriction were apparent. Overall, 42 of the 50 liveborn infants (84%) and 67% of the entire cohort of 63 patients with a midtrimester diagnosis of FEB had a normal short-term neonatal outcome. CONCLUSION: This study reiterates the increased prevalence of aneuploidy, CMV, CF and fetal growth restriction in pregnancies complicated by the midtrimester sonographic finding of FEB. However, reassuringly, 67% of cases with ultrasound-detected echogenic bowel in the second trimester had a normal short-term neonatal outcome in this multiethnic Australian population.
