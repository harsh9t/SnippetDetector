We previously reported that prostate derived Ets transcription factor (PDEF) is a breast tumor-associated molecule. To obtain further insights into PDEF expression in other human tumor types, a cDNA library database from human adult normal and tumor tissues was compiled and searched for PDEF distribution. The results showed that PDEF is present at relative higher frequencies in the cDNA libraries from brain, breast, lung and ovarian tumors in comparison to those from the corresponding normal tissues. RT/PCR analysis of PDEF expression in ovarian tumors confirmed that PDEF is expressed in 36 out of 51 (71%) ovarian tumors. Further comparison of the distribution of PDEF with other widely recognized cancer-associated molecules showed that PDEF has more restricted distributions than Her-2/neu, Bcl-2, survivin or telomerase in cDNA libraries from normal human tissues and more increased distribution than Her-2/neu, CA-125, Bcl-2, survivin and telomerase in cDNA libraries from brain (except survivin), breast, lung and ovarian tumors. These data together show a better tumor-association for PDEF and suggest that PDEF is a more suitable target for developing specific cancer therapies.
