Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It is widely used as an antidote in comatose patients suspected of having ingested a benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is known to induce cardiac arythmias and seizures, in part because of drug interactions. We present a 75-year-old woman, who was brought to the Emergency Department with a drug overdose following a suicide attempt. She developed generalized seizures shortly after the administration of flumazenil.
