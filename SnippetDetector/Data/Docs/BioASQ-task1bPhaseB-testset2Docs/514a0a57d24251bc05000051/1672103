Flumazenil, a potent benzodiazepine antagonist, is a newly synthetic imidazo-benzodiazepine, which blocks the neurological effects of benzodiazepines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of this agent in reversal of benzodiazepine overdose and differentiation of comatous patients with drug overdose. Fifteen comatous patients with suspected sedatives/hypnotics overdose were included in this study and flumazenil 0.25 mg per dose was administrated intravenously. The average score of Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 7.13 +/- 2.92 to 10.93 +/- 3.67 after one dose of flumazenil. Clear consciousness was restored after multiple doses of flumazenil administration. Three cases with different drug history and variant response after flumazenil treatment were also illustrated and discussed. The dosage of flumazenil used in this study ranged from 0.25 mg to 3 mg (average 0.87 +/- 0.74 mg). We concluded that flumazenil is an excellent antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and valuable for differentiating the patients in comatose.
