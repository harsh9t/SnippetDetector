CpG islands are stretches of DNA sequence that are enriched in the (CpG)n repeat and are present in close association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome. Methylation of CpG islands strongly influences both structural organization and function of chromatin. The presence of a CpG island in a given chromosomal domain can, by itself, give rise to relatively open and active chromatin. Recently, several histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and chromatin remodeling factors have been found to be part of the transcription machinery. It is becoming increasingly clear that CpG islands and their methylation status may influence the function or recruitment of these newly discovered chromatin remodeling factors, especially the histone deacetylases. In addition, CpG islands may also play a significant role in the reorganization of chromatin during mammalian spermiogenesis.
