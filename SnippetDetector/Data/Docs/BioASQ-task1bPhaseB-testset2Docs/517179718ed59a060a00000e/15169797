PURPOSE: To determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum-tolerated dose of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib administered intravenously weekly for 4 every 5 weeks; to determine the bortezomib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using plasma levels and an assay for 20S proteasome inhibition (PI) in whole blood; to correlate toxicity with bortezomib dose and degree of 20S PI; and to conduct a preliminary determination of the antitumor activity of bortezomib in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients (48 with AIPCa) received 128 cycles of bortezomib in doses ranging from 0.13 to 2.0 mg/m(2)/dose, utilizing a careful escalation scheme with a continuous reassessment method. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed in 24 patients (at 1.45 to 2.0 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: A dose-related 20S PI was seen, with dose-limiting toxicity at 2.0 mg/m(2) (diarrhea, hypotension) occurring at an average 1-hour post-dose of >/= 75% 20S PI. Other side effects were fatigue, hypertension, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. No relationship was seen between body-surface area and bortezomib clearance over the narrow dose range tested. There was evidence of biologic activity (decline in serum prostate-specific antigen and interleukin-6 levels) at >/= 50% 20S PI. Two patients with AIPCa had prostate-specific antigen response and two patients had partial response in lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in this schedule is 1.6 mg/m(2). Biologic activity (inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B-related markers) and antitumor activity is seen in AIPCa at tolerated doses of bortezomib. This agent should be further explored with chemotherapy agents in advanced prostate cancer.
