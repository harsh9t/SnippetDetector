PURPOSE: We performed a phase I study of a day (D) 1 and D4 bortezomib administration once every 2 weeks to determine the recommended phase II dose and toxicity profile, and the extent of 20S proteasome inhibition obtained. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with solid tumors or lymphomas were treated with bortezomib at 0.25 to 1.9 mg/m2 on D1 and D4, every 2 weeks. 20S proteasome levels in blood were assayed at baseline and at 1, 4, and 24 hours postdose in cycle 1. RESULTS: On this D1 and D4 every 2 weeks' schedule, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evident at the 1.75 and 1.9 mg/m2 dose levels, most commonly in patients receiving individual total doses > or = 3.0 mg. The main DLT was peripheral neuropathy evident at the higher doses and in patients previously exposed to neurotoxic agents. Other DLTs included diarrhea and fatigue; grade 3 thrombocytopenia was also noted. Reversible inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was dose dependent and best fit a total dose (mg) per fraction rather than mg/m2; 70% of baseline activity was inhibited by a dose of 3.0 to 3.5 mg given on D1 and on D4 every other week. Antitumor effects short of confirmed partial responses were observed in patients with melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Bortezomib (PS-341) is a novel antineoplastic agent that is well tolerated at doses not exceeding 3.0 mg (equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2), repeated on D1 and D4 every other week. This dose correlates with 70% inhibition of 20S proteasome activity. DLTs include neuropathy, fatigue, and diarrhea.
