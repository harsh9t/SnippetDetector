Even though there are many drugs for the treatment of gastric ulcers, these drugs sometimes cannot succeed. Since the 1950s, antidepressant drugs have been used for several non-psychiatric indications. A lot of antidepressant drugs have been shown experimentally to produce antiulcer activity in various ulcer models. This study aimed to investigate the antiulcer effects of mirtazapine and to determine its relationship with antioxidant mechanisms. The antiulcer activities of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg mirtazapine have been investigated on indomethacin-induced ulcers in rats, and the results have been compared with that of the control group. Mirtazapine decreased the indomethacin-induced ulcers significantly at all doses used. Mirtazapine significantly increased the glutathione (GSH) level, which decreased in the control group given only indomethacin. All doses of mirtazapine significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) level in stomach tissue compared to the control. Additionally, all doses of mirtazapine reversed the decrease in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in the stomach tissue of control rats. And finally, all doses of mirtazapine decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels significantly compared to the control. In conclusion, the activation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms and the inhibition of some toxic oxidant mechanisms play a role in the antiulcer effect mechanism of mirtazapine. This new indication of mirtazapine will make it the first-choice drug in depressive patients with gastric ulcers.
