A considerable number of new drugs were introduced over the last few years. In this report we analyze to what extent they have come to be used in clinical practice and what changes in drug use have resulted from the availability of the new compounds. For this purpose, data on drug use in 1995 and 2001 assessed at two reference days per year and per hospital within the drug safety program AMSP were compared for 10 hospitals that had been participating in both years. Atypical neuroleptics (NL) were used in 59.9 % of patients on NLs in 2001 (16.7 % in 1995), most frequently olanzapine, risperidone, clozapine, and quetiapine, in this order. Thirty-nine percent of patients still received typical NLs in antipsychotic indication (77.1 % in 1995), and 30.8 % received typical hypnosedative NLs (38.1 % in 1995). SSRIs, other new ADs, and TCAs were used in similar rates in 2001, i. e., in 40.5 %, 37.9 %, and 34.8 % of AD patients, respectively (1995 : 24.2 %, 6.2 %, and 72.3 %, respectively). Mirtazapine was the most common AD in 2001, followed by citalopram, sertraline, and doxepin. Hypnotics were prescribed more frequently in 2001 (17.6 % vs. 11.7 %), mostly BZD agonists at that time, whereas overall anxiolytic use (in approximately 30 %) hardly changed over time. Mood stabilizers and anti-dementia drugs were given comparatively rarely, even in pertinent diagnoses. Polypharmacy was observed in about three-quarters of patients on psychotropic drugs, with a trend towards increasing use over time. Combinations of two NLs, of NL + AD, and of NLs + anxiolytic were most common in both years. Twenty percent of patients on atypical NLs received typical antipsychotic NLs additionally; typical hypnosedative NLs were used along with typical antipsychotics and atypical NLs in 20 % and 22 % of patients, respectively. TCAs and either SSRIs or other new ADs were still the most common AD combinations in 2001. Data were also analyzed according to the main diagnostic categories.
