Major depression is a serious disease with various systemic effects, including dysfunction of the immune response. Taurine has been known to be related to certain modifications of the immune system. The aim of this study was to determine the taurine concentration in lymphocytes of patients with major depression and to evaluate the influence of the antidepressant treatment with mirtazapine for six weeks on the levels of taurine. Gamma-aminobutyric acid, aspartate, glutamate and glutamine were also determined. Taurine, aspartate and glutamine levels were increased in the lymphocytes of depressed patients before mirtazapine treatment compared to the control group, and were normalized after treatment. Gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate did not differ between patients and controls. There was a significant and positive correlation between the severity of the disorder, measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale, and the concentration of taurine in the lymphocytes of depressed patients before treatment. This correlation was not observed after treatment and neither was there a correlation observed for the other amino acids. The present observations could be an indication of the relevance of taurine as a protective agent in the lymphocytes of patients with severe depression, and could be the result of modifications of taurine transport or efflux processes.
