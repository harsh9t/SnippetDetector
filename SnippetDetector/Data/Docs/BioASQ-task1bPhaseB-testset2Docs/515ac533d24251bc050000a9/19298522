3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) is a novel endogenous relative of thyroid hormone, able to interact with trace amine-associated receptors, a class of plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors, and to produce a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect. In the isolated rat heart 20-25 microM T(1)AM decreased cardiac contractility, but oxygen consumption and glucose uptake were either unchanged or disproportionately high when compared to mechanical work. In adult rat cardiomyocytes acute exposure to 20 microM T(1)AM decreased the amplitude and duration of the calcium transient. In patch clamped cardiomyocytes sarcolemmal calcium current density was unchanged while current facilitation by membrane depolarization was abolished consistent with reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release. In addition, T(1)AM decreased transient outward current (I(to)) and I(K1) background current. SR studies involving 20 microM T(1)AM revealed a significant decrease in ryanodine binding due to reduced B(max), no significant change in the rate constant of calcium-induced calcium release, a significant increase in calcium leak measured under conditions promoting channel closure, and no effect on oxalate-supported calcium uptake. Based on these observations we conclude T(1)AM affects calcium and potassium homeostasis and suggest its negative inotropic action is due to a diminished pool of SR calcium as a result of increased diastolic leak through the ryanodine receptor, while increased action potential duration is accounted for by inhibition of I(to) and I(K1) currents.
