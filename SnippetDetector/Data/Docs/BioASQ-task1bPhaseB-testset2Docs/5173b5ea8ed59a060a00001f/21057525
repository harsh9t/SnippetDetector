Introduction
ucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin structure, are marked by numerous post-translational modifications and compositional variants that influence  and  metabolism1-3. or example, transcription by  polymerase  is associated with particular modifications and variants at promoters, including histone 3 lysine 4 methylations, numerous acetylations, 2., and 3.3 (refs. 4,5). f these, 34me3 acts as a binding determinant for the 1 subunit of , mechanistically linking this modification to transcription initiation6.
y analogy to chromatin marks at promoters, marks positioned within genes physically coincide with various co-transcriptional processes and may influence or be influenced by  processing7,8. or example, depletion of human 1/20, which is required to catalyze 2 lysine 120 ubiquitylation (2ub), results in decreased chromatin association of the transcription elongation and splicing factor /1 (ref. 9). imilarly, 336me3 is catalyzed by a methyltransferase associated with elongating, hyperphosphorylated  polymerase 10 and depletion of the human enzyme, 2//3, leads to a defect in m. RNA export and changes in alternative splicing11,12.
Most provocatively, bioinformatic analyses of data from diverse animals indicate that certain histone modifications, particularly H3K36me3, are not only elevated within genes, but specifically at exons13-19. It has been suggested, though, that H3K36me3 levels simply reflect higher nucleosome occupancy at exons in Metazoa17,19. In any case, how the bulk of chromatin within genes compares to the one or few nucleosomes at each exon has not been fully elucidated.
To explore more broadly the relationships between chromatin and gene architecture, we began by analyzing published human epigenomic data. We detected regions located after active transcription start sites and extending through 5β€² introns of variable length and the first few internal exons, enriched in H2Bub, H3K23ac, and eight different methylations including H3K79me2/3. Regions in the 3β€² portions of active genes displayed H3K36me3 peaking at internal exons with elevated levels extending into each downstream intron. Intriguingly, regulated alternative splicing failed to change these histone modification profiles.

Results
hromatin marks in 5β€² introns. To discover new epigenomic features related to gene expression, we analyzed published sequencing surveys of human mononucleosomes prepared by native micrococcal nuclease digestion (MNase-seq), mononucleosome ChIP (ChIP-seq) for 20 histone methylations, 18 histone acetylations, and the histone variants H2A.Z and H3.3, as well as cross-linked sonicated ChIP-seq of H2B lysine 120 ubiquitylation20-24. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of this large data set, producing a smaller number of dimensions, or principal components, that retain much of the variance in the original data set (see Methods). Thus, we aimed to identify subsets of the 41 chromatin marks that occurred at similar regions of the genome.To identify relationships specific to genes, we applied PCA to data from 10 kb upstream to 10 kb downstream of transcription start sites (TSSs) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The first principal component corresponded to the 17 marks previously characterized as a β€�backboneβ€� at active promoters23 (H2A.Z, H2BK5ac, H2BK12ac, H2BK20ac, H2BK120ac, H3K4ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me1, H3K18ac, H3K27ac, H3K36ac, H4K5ac, H4K8ac, and H4K91ac). We also identified four more acetylations at active promoters (H2AK9ac, H3K23ac, H4K12ac, and H4K16ac). The second principal component included nucleosomes and marks that were generally depleted near active promoters, but had elevated occupancy within genes. The third principal component included high levels of H2BK5me1, H2Bub, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K9me1, H3K23ac, H3K79me1, H3K79me2, H3K79me3, and H4K20me1.Intriguingly, we noticed that several marks, particularly those enriched in the third principal component, were enriched in the 5β€² regions of actives genes. This was reminiscent of their spatial distribution in yeast10, but in humans these marks extended downstream into 5β€² introns of varying length, decreasing in the vicinity of exons (Fig. 2a). To assess if this were a genome-wide phenomenon, we aligned thousands of genes by TSSs and sorted them by distances from the TSSs to the first 3β€² splice sites, plotting each gene as a row with sequencing read density as a heatmap. Thus, this perspective simultaneously displayed three different aspects of gene architecture: TSS positions, first introns, and first internal exons. In this view, principal component three, and to a lesser extent component two, displayed a 5β€² bias that decreased near internal exons, with enrichment more apparent at genes with higher expression (Supplementary Fig. 1).Analyzing individual chromatin marks in this way revealed specific relationships with features of gene architectureΒ (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). As expected, promoter marks high in principal component one, such as H3K4me3, surrounded TSSs. Nucleosomes, high in component two, appeared slightly higher near TSSs and internal exons than within neighboring introns13,16-19. H3K79me2, representative of the 10 marks high in component three, showed enrichment that extended downstream of TSSs into first introns until reaching internal exons. In contrast, H3K36me3 exhibited a spatially reciprocal relationship with H3K79me2, clearly peaking at internal exons. As a control, H3K27me1 was present within active genes20, but exhibited little if any change with respect to exons (Supplementary Fig. 2).Histone modifications separable from nucleosome occupancyInterpreting the distribution of histone modifications from MNase- and ChIP-seq data is complicated by potential technical artifacts25-27 and nucleosome occupancy biases13,16-19,27. Therefore, we independently assessed intronic and exonic marks by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) at the STIM1 gene, as it has internal exons separated by large 5β€² introns (Supplementary Fig. 3). Validating the ChIP-seq profiles, we observed enrichment for H3K79me2 in the first three long introns and H3K36me3 near exons. H3 displayed some heterogeneity along STIM1, which may reflect differential nucleosome occupancy or positioning, especially at exons13,16-19. However, H3K36me3 near the exons of STIM1 remained enriched after normalization to H3, although reduced in dynamic range.Across the genome, normalizing ChIP-seq data by MNase-seq data largely removed exon-centered enrichment for most marks (e.g. H3K79me2), but H3K36me3 remained enriched after normalization, peaking near exons and extending on average a few kilobases downstream (Supplementary Fig. 4). Also, performing PCA and heatmap analyses after normalizing each ChIP-seq dataset by MNase-seq (Supplementary Fig. 4) supported similar conclusions as the analyses without normalization above (Figs. 1 and 2).Histone modifications transitioning near bona fide exonsWe considered the possibility that nucleosome occupancy at internal exons could function as the signal delineating intronic and exonic regions. Bona fide internal exons are annotations of spliced RNAs, minimally including 3β€² and 5β€² splice sites with additional sequence constraints to encode proteins and include splicing enhancer and silencer sites. Spies et al. identified intronic exon-like sequence composition regions (ECRs) that are not spliced, but which have high nucleosome occupancy like that at bona fide exons18.We compared ECRs to bona fide exons to determine if the general sequence composition sufficient to direct high nucleosome occupancy18 were also sufficient to pattern histone modifications. To control for biases in number and position of ECRs relative to all exons, we compared each intronic ECR (12,687 total) to its nearest bona fide exon. Similar to genome-wide averages of H3K36me3 at exons (Supplementary Fig. 4), H3K36me3 peaked at ECR-matched exons (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, H3K36me3 did not peak at ECR positions. On average, marks in the third principal component were higher upstream of exons than downstream and a similar pattern was found near ECRs, although the marks variably displayed decreased spatial response to ECRs compared to exons (e.g. H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K9me1, and H3K23ac). As a control for comparison, H3K27me1 showed little difference up- and downstream of exons or ECRs (Supplementary Fig. 5).Histone modifications stable despite changes in splicingFinding that nucleosome occupancy could not fully account for the spatial dynamics of histone modifications that change near exons, we considered a model in which RNA splicing events are mechanistically linked to co-transcriptional histone modification, thus coupling exon positions to chromatin states. Splicing is a complex, multistep process that involves recognition of splice sites and progression of spliceosome assembly, ultimately resulting in intron excision28. Both splice site recognition and spliceosome assembly can be regulated to produce alternative RNA splicing outcomes29. To test if RNA splicing itself could direct histone modification profiles, we examined two cases of alternative splicing in which the frequency of exon inclusion was experimentally manipulable without altering the DNA/RNA sequence.In our first example, YPEL5 exon 2 inclusion increases when cells are treated with caffeine30. To assess both YPEL5 expression and alternative splicing, we measured total mRNA by qPCR and the ratio of mRNA isoforms by RT-PCR in various concentrations of caffeine. After 7 hours exposure, mRNA levels were similar between 6 mM and 18 mM caffeine (Supplementary Fig. 6), while exon 2 inclusion increased from 1% inclusion to 66% inclusion (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6). We verified that our ChIP-qPCR at YPEL5 spatially recapitulated the profiles of H3K79me2, H3K36me3, and nucleosomes in the ChIP-seq and MNase-seq data (Supplementary Fig. 6). Notably, H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 profiles were similar at the low and high caffeine concentrations (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the dramatic change in splicing of YPEL5 RNA was not sufficient to direct changes in these histone modifications.As with many alternative splicing events, little is known about the mechanism of YPEL5 exon 2 inclusion. Moreover, we were constrained to short treatment periods in the experiments, as high levels of caffeine are toxic. Hence, we sought a second example of regulated alternative splicing, in which changes in alternative splicing could be maintained over many cell divisions. In lymphocytes, the RNA-binding protein hnRNPLL binds to CD45 pre-mRNA to promote cell-type specific exon-skipping of multiple CD45 exons31-33. Although B cells typically express long isoforms of CD45, the B cell lymphoma lines BJAB and BL41 express different levels of hnRNPLL, and consequently, maintain different CD45 isoforms31.We obtained a set of matched BJAB and BL41 cell lines in which hnRNPLL levels are stably decreased by short hairpin RNA interference or increased by hnRNPLL over-expression, respectively31. BJAB and BL41 cells incidentally expressed 100-fold different levels of CD45 mRNA, so we compared matched lines to control for variable CD45 expression (Fig. 4a). RT-PCR analysis to assay variable inclusion of exons 4-6 confirmed that depletion of hnRNPLL in BJAB cells increased inclusion, whereas overexpression of hnRNPLL in BL41 cells decreased inclusion (Fig. 4b). H3K36me3, H3K79me2, and nucleosome levels at CD45Β measured by ChIP-qPCR were generally similar to published ChIP-seq and MNase-seq data in T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7). If RNA splicing were sufficient to change histone modifications, increased exon inclusion at exons 4-6 should decrease H3K79me2 and/or increase H3K36me3 levels. However, we observed no significant differences in histone modifications between matched pairs of BJAB or BL41 cells expressing different CD45 isoforms (Fig. 4c,d).

Discussion
e used  to help identify groups of histone marks (ig. 1) that displayed distinct profiles within active genes (upplementary ig. 1). mong these, we identified a group of 10 marks biased for 5β€² introns and roughly reciprocal with 336me3 near exons (ig. 2 and upplementary ig. 2). equence-related nucleosome occupancy alone was not sufficient to explain transitions between intronic and exonic histone modification regions (upplementary ig. 5). he genome-wide phenomenon of intronic and exonic marks suggests that a general mechanism associated with splicing influences histone marking, as speculated previously15. hus, we tested if levels of  splicing influenced the profiles of these histone modifications. either inducible changes in exon inclusion in 5 after several hours (ig. 3), nor changes in inclusion of multiple exons in 45 over numerous cell divisions (ig. 4) resulted in significant differences in 379me2 or 336me3. his contrasts starkly with transcriptional induction, in which 379me2 and 336me3 levels can increase within one hour34.
ur results rule out a simple correlation between the extent of  splicing and histone modification levels. ntriguingly, regulated skipping of 45 exon 4 is achieved by stalling spliceosome assembly at an early step following exon definition35; therefore, spliceosome assembly may be sufficient to pattern histone modifications at 45 exon 4, regardless of splicing outcomes. s it is now recognized that promoter marks are relatively stable36,37 and may reflect transcription initiation38 rather than productive transcription, we suggest by analogy that intronic and exonic marks are relatively stable and may reflect an aspect of the splicing process, such as exon definition, rather than productive splicing per se.
f a feature related to splicing were required to influence histone modifications, we would expect a decrease in 5β€² intron marks and an increase in 336me3 specifically at bona fide exons, but not at s, which have similar sequence composition, but are not spliced. ndeed, s do not direct increased levels of 336me3 as at exons or decreased levels of certain 5β€² intronic marks (i.e. 34me1, 34me2, 39me1, 323ac) (upplementary ig. 5). n contrast, some 5β€² intronic marks (e.g. 3 lysine 79 methylations) have nearly equivalent decreases near exons and s, suggesting that the local sequence composition of exons (and s) may be sufficient to influence these histone modification profiles. hus, cis-acting sequences, functioning as  or , could signal to change histone modifications. or example,  protein binding sites at exons could affect chromatin marking through β€�reverseβ€� coupling8. dditionally, elevated nucleosome occupancy at exons13,16-19 may play a role, independently or in conjunction with cis-acting sequences. xtensive mutagenesis will be essential to distinguish between these possibilities and identify necessary sequences.
ow distinct histone modification patterns are determined remains largely unknown. n agreement with pies et al.18, we find that histone modification patterns do not merely reflect nucleosome enrichment at exons, indicating the need for additional steps of regulation beyond nucleosome occupancy such as chromatin modifying enzyme action. patial similarities among the intronic marks could reflect cross-regulation between histone modifications39. or example, the extensive overlap between 2ub and 379me2/3 (upplementary ig. 2) is consistent with direct stimulation by 2ub of 3 lysine 79 methyltransferase activity by 1 and a 1-containing protein complex40,41. lso, 2ub can directly stimulate human 1-mediated methylation of 3 lysine 4 in vitro, so 2ub within 5β€² introns may help to increase 34me1 and 34me2 (refs. 42,43).
e propose that promoter, intronic, and exonic intragenic histone modification regions constitute three distinct chromatin zones at active human genes4,23, analogous to those found in yeast10,44: i) the β€�backboneβ€� or promoter zone contains 34me3, ii) a 5β€² zone includes 34me2 (and 9 other marks in humans, including 379me2), and iii) a 3β€² zone contains 336me3 (ig. 2a). owever, most yeast genes are short and intronless, in contrast to human genes, which frequently contain large first introns. lso, we found occasionally that these different zones may interdigitate, e.g. there was switching back and forth between 379me2 and 336me3 within 1 (upplementary ig. 3). his implies that these zones are not strictly 5β€² and 3β€² with respect to genic positioning, but rather that introns and exons act to organize intragenic histone modifications.
ntronic and exonic histone modifications can, in principle, affect many aspects of gene expression7. or example, 336me3-modified nucleosomes could directly influence splicing12. urthermore, 336me3 levels on average are slightly lower at alternatively spliced exons compared to nearby constitutive exons14,15,17. n open question for future studies remains: how are these marks established and maintained at particular introns and exons within the same transcribed unit?  working knowledge of such localization mechanisms will be paramount to understanding temporal and spatial regulation of chromatin marks in humans.Discussion

The genome-wide phenomenon of intronic and exonic marks suggests that a general mechanism associated with splicing influences histone marking, as speculated previously15. Thus, we tested if levels of RNA splicing influenced the profiles of these histone modifications. Neither inducible changes in exon inclusion in YPEL5 after several hours (Fig. 3), nor changes in inclusion of multiple exons in CD45 over numerous cell divisions (Fig. 4) resulted in significant differences in H3K79me2 or H3K36me3.

If a feature related to splicing were required to influence histone modifications, we would expect a decrease in 5β€² intron marks and an increase in H3K36me3 specifically at bona fide exons, but not at ECRs, which have similar sequence composition, but are not spliced. Indeed, ECRs do not direct increased levels of H3K36me3 as at exons or decreased levels of certain 5β€² intronic marks (i.e. H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K9me1, H3K23ac) (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast, some 5β€² intronic marks (e.g. H3 lysine 79 methylations) have nearly equivalent decreases near exons and ECRs, suggesting that the local sequence composition of exons (and ECRs) may be sufficient to influence these histone modification profiles. Thus, cis-acting sequences, functioning as DNA or RNA, could signal to change histone modifications. For example, SR protein binding sites at exons could affect chromatin marking through β€�reverseβ€� coupling8. Additionally, elevated nucleosome occupancy at exons13,16-19 may play a role, independently or in conjunction with cis-acting sequences. Extensive mutagenesis will be essential to distinguish between these possibilities and identify necessary sequences.

Spatial similarities among the intronic marks could reflect cross-regulation between histone modifications39. For example, the extensive overlap between H2Bub and H3K79me2/3 (Supplementary Fig. 2) is consistent with direct stimulation by H2Bub of H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase activity by DOT1L and a DOT1L-containing protein complex40,41. Also, H2Bub can directly stimulate human SET1-mediated methylation of H3 lysine 4 in vitro, so H2Bub within 5β€² introns may help to increase H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 (refs. 42,43).
We propose that promoter, intronic, and exonic intragenic histone modification regions constitute three distinct chromatin zones at active human genes4,23, analogous to those found in yeast10,44: i) the β€�backboneβ€� or promoter zone contains H3K4me3, ii) a 5β€² zone includes H3K4me2 (and 9 other marks in humans, including H3K79me2), and iii) a 3β€² zone contains H3K36me3 (Fig. 2a). However, most yeast genes are short and intronless, in contrast to human genes, which frequently contain large first introns. Also, we found occasionally that these different zones may interdigitate, e.g. there was switching back and forth between H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 within STIM1 (Supplementary Fig. 3). This implies that these zones are not strictly 5β€² and 3β€² with respect to genic positioning, but rather that introns and exons act to organize intragenic histone modifications.
Intronic and exonic histone modifications can, in principle, affect many aspects of gene expression7. For example, H3K36me3-modified nucleosomes could directly influence splicing12. Furthermore, H3K36me3 levels on average are slightly lower at alternatively spliced exons compared to nearby constitutive exons14,15,17. An open question for future studies remains: how are these marks established and maintained at particular introns and exons within the same transcribed unit? A working knowledge of such localization mechanisms will be paramount to understanding temporal and spatial regulation of chromatin marks in humans.

Methods
pigenomic analyses. Analyses were performed and plots were generated with custom R scripts (http://www.r-project.org). Human gene models were obtained from the UCSC genome browser RefSeq (hg18) annotations (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). We offset sequencing read end-positions by 73 bases (half the width of the canonical nucleosome) to approximate the position of nucleosomal centers. MNase- and ChIP-seq reads were aggregated in non-overlapping 1-kb windows from 10 kb upstream to 10 kb downstream of TSSs and data across these genomic segments were subjected to PCA. PCA was performed by singular value decomposition with the data centered and scaled using the R function prcomp(). Figure 1 was rendered in PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/). For all plots only one gene model was shown for genes with multiple models. For Figure 2a and Supplementary Figures 6 and 7, a Gaussian kernel density estimator was used with both the kernel width and bin size set to 146 bp (size of one canonical nucleosome). The kernel density scale was adjusted so that uniform density would be equal to 1 at all positions. We did not precisely map the positions of individual nucleosomes, because our analysis was generally on the scale of tens to hundreds of nucleosomes. However, we verified that the plots were robust to changes in nucleosome phasing and average width in the kernel density estimator.Cell culture and regulated alternative splicingSW620 human colon cancer cells (ATCC CCL-227) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v), Pen-Strep, and Normocin (Amaxa). They were grown to near confluence for the experiments in Supplementary Figure 3 and were seeded at a density of 1 Γ— 105 cells per cm2 24 hours prior to treatment with media supplemented with the indicated concentration of caffeine for 7 hours in Figure 3. BJAB and BL41 B cell lines31 were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v), glutamine, Pen-Strep, and Normocin (and 5 ΞΌg ml-1 puromycin for the BJAB lines) to a density of about 1 Γ— 106 cells ml-1. The earliest passages available for the B cell experiments were used, because the effect on CD45 alternative splicing decreased over continual passaging.Cross-linked mononucleosome ChIPChIP was performed as described34 with the following modifications. Nuclei from 1 Γ— 107 crosslinked cells were digested with 100 units of MNase (Worthington) in 500 ΞΌl of Buffer N supplemented with 3 mM CaCl2 for 10 min at 37Β°C. We previously determined the concentration of MNase to be optimal for digestion to mostly mononucleosomes by agarose gel electrophoresis of the cross-link reversed input chromatin. Chromatin extract equivalent to 2 Γ— 106 cells in 500 ΞΌl of RIPA was incubated with 4 ΞΌg of one of the following antibodies for 2 hours at 4Β°C: H3K79me2, H3K36me3, or H3 (Abcam ab3594, ab9050, or ab1791). Instead of Protein A/G agarose beads, 50 ΞΌl of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were added to each tube and incubated overnight at 4Β°C. After the chromatin elution step, DNA was purified with QIAquick PCR columns (QIAGEN) and quantified by qPCR as described below.To analyze ChIP-qPCR data, we used MNase-digested input material as a quantitative standard, thereby measuring the efficiency of immunoprecipitation, and internally controlling for digestion biases. In addition, we normalized H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 ChIP to an H3 ChIP to control for differences in nucleosome occupancy (Supplementary Fig. 3). It should be noted that ChIP-qPCR is subject to particular caveats, most notably the dependence on fixed primer positions. As such, MNase digestion of DNA around strongly positioned nucleosomes can negatively affect the amplification efficiency of partially overlapping amplicons. Similarly, histone modifications or variants may differentially influence the extent of MNase digestion and, consequently, bias amplification efficiency. We attempted to minimize these effects by tiling genes with primer sets designed to amplify small segments of DNA (62 bp median amplicon size, Supplementary Table 1).Quantitative PCRPCR primers (Supplementary Table 1) were designed with BatchPrimer3 v1.0 (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/BatchPrimer3/) from human repeat-masked sequence obtained from the UCSC genome browser (hg18). Serial dilutions of DNA ranging from 50% to 0.4% of the input chromatin were used to obtain calibration curves, measure primer efficiencies, and ensure that quantification was in a linear dynamic range. Primer sets yielding multiple amplification products or calibration curves with R-squared values of < 0.96 were excluded. For each qPCR sample, 0.5 ΞΌl of 50 ΞΌl eluted ChIP DNA was amplified in 25 ΞΌl volume reactions containing 250 ΞΌM dNTPs, 1 Γ— (NH4)2SO4 buffer (Fermentas), 0.5 ΞΌM primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 units Dynazyme II (Finnzymes), and Sybr Green I fluorescent dye (Sigma). Fluorescence was measured on a BioRad CFX-96 machine using standard cycling conditions (3 min at 95Β°C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95Β°C, 30 s at 55Β°C, and 15 s at 72Β°C). Each ChIP value was calculated as the median of 2-4 technical qPCR replicates. For each biological replicate consisting of qPCR replicates, median ChIP values for H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 were then divided by median H3 ChIP values.
