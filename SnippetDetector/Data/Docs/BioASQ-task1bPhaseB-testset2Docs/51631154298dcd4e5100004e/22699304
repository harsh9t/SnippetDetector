PURPOSE: Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor drug very effective against multiple myeloma, may induce the so-called bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN), hardly manageable with common analgesic drugs. This study assessed the effectiveness of controlled-release (CR) oral oxycodone in controlling pain and its interference on daily functions of patients with hematologic malignancies affected by BIPN. METHODS: Forty-six patients (median age, 62 years) affected by myeloma and lymphoma, complaining of BIPN-related pain of moderate-to-severe intensity and unresponsive to previous analgesic treatments, were treated with CR oxycodone. The intensity of continuous and brief pain (BP) along with interference of pain with the common daily dimensions of feeling and function were evaluated by using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS); a global patient evaluation of efficacy was also performed. RESULTS: The daily average dose of CR oxycodone administered was 28.46 mg (range, 20-80 mg). The pain intensity decreased from a mean NRS value of 7.6 at baseline to 1.3 on day 14. The frequency of BP was reduced from 61 to 47% of patients and its intensity from 7.4 to 3.1 NRS score. A similar trend to decreasing values was observed for all the daily life functions. Slight- or mild-intensity side effects were observed in 23 patients (51%). At the end of the study, 75% of patients found the treatment effective or very effective. CONCLUSION: CR oxycodone for relief of BIPN-related pain was effective and well tolerated. The pain control significantly improved also the quality of the daily life functions, which are usually compromised in these suffering patients.
