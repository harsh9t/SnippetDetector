Targeted drug delivery systems aim to improve the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of potent therapeutics in treatments for a variety of diseases. or example, chemotherapy is one of the major systemic treatments for cancer, but it is linked to serious side effects because of its toxicity to normal proliferating cells. ancer-targeting delivery systems have been developed to alter the biodistribution of drugs, aiming to achieve drug accumulation in cancer tissue through the enhanced permeability and retention () effect and/or targeting of the cancer cell surface.(1) dvanced delivery systems for anticancer drugs often utilize environmentally triggered mechanisms.2β�’4 or example, the extracellular p. H in tumor tissue is slightly lower than that in normal tissue, and this has been exploited to accomplish pH-triggered drug release in tumor tissue.(5) In addition, the significantly increased acidity in subcellular compartments such as the endosome also offers a complementary route to increases in the efficacy of anticancer drug delivery via pH-initiated release of drugs from endocytosed drug carriers.5,6

Here we describe a novel polymer conjugate of the anticancer drug bortezomib () that can be used for p. H-sensitive delivery to specific cancer cells. BTZ is a dipeptide boronic acid analogue that inhibits cancer cell proteasome through direct binding between its boronic acid group and threonine residues in the active sites of several proteases.7,8 This drug is currently marketed as Velcade (Millenium Pharmaceuticals) and has been approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma treatment; however, BTZ is less active against many solid tumors and has significant dose-limiting toxicity.9,10 In addition to the possibility that different cancer cells may have distinct proteasome sensitivity to BTZ,11,12 the unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of BTZ, including nonspecific binding to proteins and rapid hepatic clearance from blood, may also contribute to its limited efficacy against solid tumors.13,14 This suggests that polymeric delivery vehicles capable of enhancing the pharmacokinetic properties of BTZ may improve its activity against solid tumors. Moreover, strategies to direct BTZ to cancer cells by specific cell surface recognition epitopes and/or trigger pH-regulated drug release may facilitate drug delivery and release in tumors, thereby potentially increasing the efficacy and reducing the toxicity of BTZ.

It has been previously reported that polyphenols can chemically block the proteasome-inhibiting activity of  through conjugation to the boronic acid active site and that the formed conjugates cannot permeate freely through the cell membrane.15β�’18 ur design takes advantage of the facile conjugation of  to the 1,2-benzenediol (catechol) moiety to form a membrane-impermeable compound in order to reduce nonselective cellular uptake of the drug. n important characteristic of the boronic acidβ€“catechol conjugate is that it is formed through dynamic covalent chemistry that is reversible in a p. H-sensitive manner:(19) at neutral or alkaline pH, BTZ and catechol form a stable boronate ester, which deactivates the cytotoxicity of BTZ; in a low-pH environment, the BTZβ€“catechol ester conjugate readily dissociates to release free BTZ and catechol groups. This mechanism has the potential to be exploited in two contexts: (1) extracellularly for localized drug release within the mildly acidic tumor interstitium and (2) intracellularly in the more acidic endosomes following cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis. In both cases, the acidic environment would result in dissociation of BTZ from the polymer-bound catechol groups, activating its proteasome-inhibiting function (Figure 1).

We first characterized the p. H-dependent reversible binding between BTZ and catechol compounds using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2A). At pH 5.5, a mixture of BTZ and dopamine (DA) produced a spectrum similar to that of the two individual compounds superimposed upon each other, indicating the presence of uncomplexed BTZ and DA. However, the same mixture at pH 7.4 gave a spectrum with striking changes in chemical shifts and peak splittings, revealing the formation of a BTZβ€“DA conjugate. To investigate further the pH sensitivity of BTZβ€“catechol dissociation, preformed BTZβ€“DA conjugate [0.1 M in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6)] was diluted to 1 mM in deuterated phosphate buffer at pH 5.5β€“8.5 and then analyzed by NMR spectroscopy (Figure SI 1 in the Supporting Information). The peak integrals in the ranges 7.0β€“7.2, 6.6β€“6.8, and 5.5β€“6.5 ppm, corresponding to the H atoms on the phenyl ring of BTZ, the benzene ring of free DA, and the benzene of the BTZβ€“DA complex, respectively, were used to estimate the degree of BTZβ€“DA complexation. As shown in Figure 2B, dissociation of the BTZβ€“DA complex increased as the pH decreased from 8.5 to 6.5, and the BTZβ€“DA complex was undetectable at pH 5.5.

The p. H dependence of the BTZβ€“catechol complex suggested that polymer constructs containing catechols may be useful for pH-triggered release of BTZ. We therefore synthesized several BTZβ€“polymer constructs as pH-responsive carriers of BTZ to cancer cells (Scheme 1). We employed a modular heterobifunctional polymer design consisting of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer derivatized with one or more catechols and a cell-targeting moiety. PEG is well-known to reduce nonspecific interactions of therapeutic molecules with proteins and cells and therefore has been widely applied in the form of drugβ€“PEG conjugates that exhibit reduced drug degradation and extended drug circulation time.(20) Here we used biotin as a cell-targeting ligand because previous reports have shown that biotinylated polymers can be selectively taken up by cancer cells.21,22 Although the biotin receptors/transporters on cancer cell surfaces have not been well-characterized, biotin has a relatively simple structure and thus can also be used as a tag for cellular tracking of polymer drug carriers, making this molecule an attractive choice for demonstrating cancer cell targeting. We used fluorescence microscopy to examine the uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled biotinylated PEG (biotinβ€“PEGβ€“FITC) into two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-10A-H-RasV12 cells, as well as the nontransformed or noncancerous breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A-Vector.(23) Figure 3 shows that biotinβ€“PEGβ€“FITC was rapidly taken up by cells, whereas the cellular uptake of PEGβ€“FITC without the biotin moiety was minimal. The uptake of biotinlylated polymers was inhibited by free biotin in a dose-dependent manner (Figure SI 3), demonstrating that polymer uptake by cells is mediated by the cell surface receptor for biotin. Notably, the inhibition of uptake of biotinylated polymer by free biotin was less robust in cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A-H-RasV12) than in noncancer MCF-10A-Vector cells, suggesting greater expression levels of biotin receptors in cancer cells than in noncancer cells.

After confirming the cancer-targeting function of the biotin ligand, we synthesized  polymers containing four catechol groups each ( and ; cheme 1) in order to take advantage of multiple catechol moieties to increase the drug-loading capacity of the polymeric carrier. ime-dependent release of  from these catechol polymers was carried out in buffered solutions at p. H 7.4, 6.5, and 5.0, mimicking the physiological pH in normal tissue and blood, the tumor extracellular environment, and subcellular endosome, respectively. Figure 4 shows that at pH 7.4, β�Ό30% of the BTZ was released from both BPC and PC over a 12 h period, while >80% of the BTZ was released from these catechol polymers at pH 5.0. This further confirmed the pH-dependent BTZ dissociation from the catechol-presenting polymeric delivery vehicles, which could render BTZ non-cell-permeable and inactive in normal tissues but allow the BTZ activity to be recovered in cancer tissue, where the acidity increases.

The effects of polymerβ€“ conjugates on proteasome inhibition and cell viability were first evaluated using --231 breast cancer cells (igure 5 ,). he untargeted (no biotin ligand) β€“ conjugate exhibited dramatically decreased proteasome inhibition in comparison to free , indicating deactivation of  due to formation of the β€“catechol polymer conjugate. his result is consistent with the previously reported inhibition of  activity by polyphenols,15,16,18 which we speculate may be due to the inability of β€“catechol complexes to enter cells. n stark contrast, the biotinylated conjugate β€“ retained high proteasome-inhibiting activity. ell viability assays 48 h after treatment of cells with the polymerβ€“ conjugates demonstrated a similar pattern: the biotin-receptor-targeting β€“ conjugate maintained fairly high cytotoxicity of , whereas catechol-containing polymers ( and ) without loaded drug exhibited little proteasome inhibition activity or cytotoxicity. hese results suggest that cellular uptake of the polymerβ€“ conjugate through biotin-receptor-mediated transport can restore the  activity within the cells, possibly via internalization of the polymerβ€“ conjugate followed by low-p. H-triggered intracellular dissociation of BTZ from the polymer in the endosomes. A detailed investigation of the intracellular events responsible for this effect is in progress. Some preliminary evidence for self-assembly of the polymerβ€“BTZ construct into nanostructures was observed by cryogenic transmission election microscopy (cryo-TEM) (Figure SI 2). However, the significance of these structures in relation to the observed cytotoxic effects requires further study.

To evaluate further the selectivity of the polymerβ€“drug conjugates for cancer cells over normal cells, we treated immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (-10-ector cells, a noncancer control) and transformed -10--as. V12 cells with BPCβ€“BTZ (0, 10, and 25 nM). We found that BPC loaded with BTZ at 25 nM concentration induced 1.7-fold increased cell death in the cancer cell line relative to the control cells (Figure SI 5). Calculated IC50 values for cell growth inhibition by BPCβ€“BTZ and free BTZ revealed that cancer cells were 2.2-fold more sensitive to BPCβ€“BTZ than noncancer cells, while both cell types were equally sensitive to free BTZ (Figure 5C). This result suggests that cancer cells are more susceptible to BPCβ€“BTZ toxicity than noncancer cells, a major potential therapeutic advantage of our targeted polymeric carrier platform.

This work has demonstrated targeted delivery of an anticancer drug to cancer cells using catechol-presenting polymers. hese polymeric drug carriers have a chemically defined mechanism for drug loading and release through the p. H-sensitive catecholβ€“boronic acid interaction. With the use of biotin to target cancer cells, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib delivered by such polymeric carriers showed enhanced cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells compared to noncancer cells in vitro. Variation of the catechol polymer architecture and composition and the choice of boronic acid-containing therapeutic can potentially provide great tailorability of catechol polymerβ€“boronic acid complexes for a variety of drug delivery applications. For instance, alternative targeting ligands can be exploited to alter the tissue biodistribution, and modifications of the chemical structure of the catechol (or, more generally, diol groups) can be exploited to fine-tune the pH sensitivity of the diolβ€“boronic acid complex for drug release in different tissue environments.24,25 Since the boronic acid structure exisits in many potent therapeutics,26β�’28 this pH-sensitive strategy may provide a versatile, chemoselective approach for targeted drug delivery to diseased tissues resulting from a broad spectrum of disorders.
