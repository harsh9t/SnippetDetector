OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects and safety of the regimen of bortezomib combined with dexamethasone (VD) in the treatment of primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis. METHODS: Five newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis patients confirmed by renal biopsy with a median of 3 organs involved (3 to 5 organs) were treated by VD regimen for 3 (1-4) cycles. RESULTS: Among 3 evaluable patients, 1 was in stable condition and 2 had hematologic response (partial remission and complete remission) and organ function improvement. Hematologic responses were rapid (median 1.5 cycles) and median time to organ response was 2 cycles. Three cases were survived and the periods of follow up were 5, 4 and 4 months respectively. The other 2 died 2 and 14 months after diagnosis. The side effects were asthenia, diarrhea, constipation, edema aggravation and fever, all of which were in I grade. No treatment associating death was found. CONCLUSION: VD regimen might be an efficient, rapid effective and safe regimen in the treatment of AL amyloidosis.
