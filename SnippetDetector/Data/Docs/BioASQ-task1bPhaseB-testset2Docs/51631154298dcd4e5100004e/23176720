Many patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are elderly (aged >65 years) or unfit, and therefore ineligible for stem-cell transplantation. The novel agents thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide have shown improved outcomes in these patients. This article discusses the role of continuous therapy in improving patient outcomes and how novel agents with better tolerability profiles could lead to a change in the treatment paradigm. According to the proposed concept, treatment of transplant-ineligible patients with MM should include achievement of high-quality responses with effective induction combination regimens, as well as maintenance of the response with long-term therapy for optimal sustained efficacy.
