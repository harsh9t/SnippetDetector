BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe cutaneous reactions caused by certain drugs, including antiepileptic carbamazepine. A strong association has been reported between human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Han Chinese patients. European studies suggested that HLA-B*1502 is not a universal marker but is ethnicity-specific for Asians. AIM: To study the association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Indian patients. METHODS: Eight individuals who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of SJS induced by carbamazepine were identified and HLA-B molecular typing was performed. HLA-B genotyping was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers. RESULTS: Out of eight patients studied for genotype, six patients were found to have the HLA-B*1502 allele. CONCLUSION: This study suggests an association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Indian patients.
