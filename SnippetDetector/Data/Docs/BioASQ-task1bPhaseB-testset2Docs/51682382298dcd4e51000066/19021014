Thyroid hormones modulate the immune system and metabolism, influence insulin secretion, and cause decreased glucose tolerance. Thyroid hormones have been described to change the incidence of spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis in Bio-Breeding/Worcester (BB) rats but it is unknown how these hormones affect the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The aim was to investigate the influence of changes in thyroid function during postnatal development on the prevalence of T1DM in BB rats and the influence of T3 on the beta cell mass in non-diabetic Wistar rats. BB rats were treated with sodium iodine (NaI) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) neonatally or with tri-iodo-thyronine (T3) during adolescence. At the age of 19 weeks the incidence of T1DM and the degree of insulitis were evaluated. The influence of T3 treatment on the beta cell mass was evaluated in Wistar rats by unbiased stereological methods. The incidence of T1DM in control BB rats was 68% at the age of 19 weeks. NaI and T3 reduced the incidence, whereas TSH had no effect. In Wistar rats T3 treatment increased the beta cell mass per bodyweight. The modulation of thyroid function during postnatal development may thus affect the precipitation of T1DM in genetically susceptible individuals.
