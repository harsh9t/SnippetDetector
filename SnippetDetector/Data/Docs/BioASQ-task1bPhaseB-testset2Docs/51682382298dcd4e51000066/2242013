To elucidate the mechanism of thyroid hormone-induced hyperinsulinemia, the acute and direct effect of thyroid hormone administration on insulin secretion was investigated in rats in vivo and in vitro. In the perfused rat pancreas, the addition of thyroxine (10 micrograms/dL) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (150 ng/dL) to the perfusing medium did not affect insulin secretion. The administration of thyroxine (40 micrograms/kg, s.c.) in vivo increased the plasma insulin level from 11 +/- 2 microUnits/mL (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 7 microUnits/mL, while blood glucose and plasma glucagon were unchanged. This phenomenon was inhibited completely by the preadministration of oxprenolol hydrochloride (2 mg/kg, s.c.), and inhibited partly by the preadministration of metoprolol tartrate (35 mg/kg, s.c.). These results suggest that thyroid hormone induces hyperinsulinemia via beta-adrenergic stimulation in the rat.
