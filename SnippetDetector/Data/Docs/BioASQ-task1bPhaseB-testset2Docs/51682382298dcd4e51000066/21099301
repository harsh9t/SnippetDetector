Ex vivo islet cell culture in the presence of stimulating factors prior to transplantation is considered a good strategy in contrast to the short conclusion of islets transplantation. Previously, we demonstrated how T3 can increase b-cell function via specific activation of Akt; therefore we hypothesized that thyroid hormone T3 can be considered a promising candidate for the in vitro expansion of islet cell mass. Rat pancreatic islets have been isolated by the collagenase digestion and cultured in the presence or not of the thyroid hormone T3 10⁻⁷ M. Islets viability has been evaluated by the use of two different dyes, one cell-permeable green fluorescent dye and propidium iodide, and by the analysis of core cell damage upcoming. Moreover, islets function has been evaluated by insulin secretion. The ability of b-cells to counteract apoptosis induced by streptozotocin has been analyzed by TUNEL assay. We demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat pancreatic islets with T3 results in augmented β-cell vitality with an increase of their functional properties. In addition, a sensible reduction of the core cell damage has been observed in the T3 treated islets, suggesting the preservation of the β-cells integrity during the culture period. Nonetheless, the insulin secretion is sensibly augmented after T3 stimulation. The strong increment shown in Akt activation suggests the involvement of this pathway in the observed phenomena. In conclusion we indicate T3 as a good factor to improve ex vivo islets cell culture.
