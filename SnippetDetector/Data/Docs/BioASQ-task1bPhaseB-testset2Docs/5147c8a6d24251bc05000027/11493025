Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is deficient in all tissues from human patients and animal models with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease. The deficiency results in decreased lysosomal catabolism of certain galactolipids including galactosylceramide and psychosine that are synthesized maximally during myelination. According to current theories, the accumulation of psychosine in humans and animals with GLD induces oligodendrocyte degeneration and myelination ceases. Transduction of oligodendrocytes from twitcher mice with a retroviral vector containing the GALC cDNA can correct the enzyme deficiency in these cells. Our data show that twitcher astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can internalize exogenous GALC, as well as donate the enzyme to the mutant glial cells. Antibodies against human GALC localized the GALC antigen in retrovirally transduced cells and cells receiving enzyme via cell to cell secretion and uptake to the lysosomal fraction. In fact immunocytochemical studies in transduced oligodendrocytes revealed that the GALC colocalizes in vesicles lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) (+). Moreover, labeling cells with anti-GALC and a marker for oligodendrocytes demonstrated that, upon differentiation, transduced, twitcher oligodendrocytes attained the normal branched process configuration, while untransduced cells show only abnormal morphology. Phenotype correction in mutant oligodendrocytes has also been observed after enzyme transfer. These studies indicate that GALC activity supplied to cultured oligodendrocytes from twitcher mice by different methods can correct the pathological phenotype of these cells.
