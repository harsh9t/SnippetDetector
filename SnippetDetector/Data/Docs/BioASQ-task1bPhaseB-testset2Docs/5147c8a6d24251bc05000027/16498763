Krabbe disease is an extremely rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 1,00,000 live births. It is caused by deficient activity of the Iysosomal hydrolase galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase. A 6 years old male weighing 12 kg, was brought to Rajah Muthiah Medical College and Hospital with complaints of convulsions. The full-term child was delivered by lower segment caesarean section to second-degree consanguineous parents. The baby cried immediately after birth.
