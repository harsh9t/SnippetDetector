Galactocerebrosidase (GALC, EC 3.2.1.46) was purified from human urine by a series of hydrophobic affinity column chromatography steps. The activity was enriched 176,000-fold from concentrated urine by only four columns, including octyl Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, butyl Sepharose and ethyl-agarose. The overall recovery was about 20% but only low amounts were obtained due to its low abundance. The estimated final specific activities of several batches were between 1 and 2 mmol/h per mg protein. The final purified fractions were essentially free of other lysosomal enzyme activities. The most pure fractions showed a series of bands between 50 and 53 kDa on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which were determined to have identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. In addition, gel filtration of partially purified GALC after disassociation showed one peak of activity estimated to have a molecular mass near 50 kDa. GALC was also purified from human brain and human placenta using the same methods demonstrating the usefulness of this procedure in obtaining GALC from solid human tissues. In addition to the bands migrating near 50 kDa from urine, there were also bands at 80 kDa and 30 kDa in some preparations. By N-terminal sequencing and the use of antipeptide antibodies, the 80 kDa band was demonstrated to have the same N-terminal amino acids as the 50-53 kDa bands. The 30 kDa band had a unique sequence. The relationship between the different molecular weight species remains to be determined. The purification of GALC and the securing of amino acid sequence information will aid in the cloning of the GALC gene. This enzyme is deficient in human patients with Krabbe disease and several animal species.
