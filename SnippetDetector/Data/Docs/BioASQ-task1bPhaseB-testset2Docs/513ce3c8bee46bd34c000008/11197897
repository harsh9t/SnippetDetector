Recently, the substitution of proline 250 by arginine in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, has been identified in patients with craniosynostosis and defines a new syndrome on a molecular basis. We report a 1-year-1-month-old female with bilateral coronal craniosynostosis who had the P250R mutation in FGFR3 gene detected by DNA sequencing. She had brachycephaly, temporal bossing, high and flat forehead, hypertelorism, mild proptosis, low set ears and no digital abnormalities. She underwent surgical repair at 7 months and her cosmetic problems were improved. Her development was normal up to 13 months of age. DNA analysis from her parents showed that her father had the same mutation. The phenotypes of the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 syndrome are variable even within the same family, but main characteristic clinical features are follows, 1) lateral or bilateral coronal craniosynostosis, 2) mild hand and foot anomalies, and 3) sensory deafness. In FGFR3 syndrome the diagnosis of P250R mutation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is very easy and important for early diagnosis and genetic counseling.
