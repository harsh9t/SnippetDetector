UNLABELLED: We studied the cellular function of Nell-1, a craniosynostosis-related gene, in craniofacial development. Nell-1 modulates calvarial osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis pathways. Nell-1 overexpression disrupts these pathways resulting in craniofacial anomalies such as premature suture closure. INTRODUCTION: Craniosynostosis (CS), one of the most common congenital craniofacial deformities, is the premature closure of cranial sutures. Previously, we reported NELL-1 as a novel molecule overexpressed during premature cranial suture closure in patients with CS. Nell-1 overexpression induced calvarial overgrowth and resulted in premature suture closure in a rodent model. On a cellular level, Nell-1 is suggested to promote osteoblast differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different levels of Nell-1 were introduced into osteoblastic cells by viral infection and recombinant protein. Apoptosis and gene expression assays were performed. Mice overexpressing Nell-1 were examined for apoptosis. RESULTS: In this report, we further showed that overexpression of Nell-1 induced apoptosis along with modulation of apoptosis-related genes. The induction of apoptosis by Nell-1 was observed only in osteoblastic cells and not in NIH3T3 or primary fibroblasts. The CS mouse model overexpressing Nell-1 showed increased levels of apoptosis in the calvaria. CONCLUSION: We show that Nell-1 expression modulates calvarial osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis pathways. Nell-1 overexpression disrupts these pathways resulting in craniofacial anomalies such as premature suture closure.
