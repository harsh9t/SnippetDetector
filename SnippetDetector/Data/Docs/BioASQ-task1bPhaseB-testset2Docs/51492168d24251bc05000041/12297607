Most instruments used to assess poststroke depression have never been specifically validated in stroke patients. This study evaluated the depression screening abilities of three questionnaires and one observer-rated scale in 202 consecutive patients 1 month after they experienced their first-ever ischemic stroke. At their respective optimum cutoff values, the sensitivity of the self-rated scales varied between 80% and 90%, while the specificity was about 60%. For the observer-rated scale (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), sensitivity was 78.1%, and specificity was 74.6%. The instruments clearly performed better in men than in women. Despite this difference, it was concluded that all scales were acceptable screening instruments for poststroke depression.
