The literature suggests the hypothesis that nonpsychiatrists will underrecognize depression in evaluations of stroke patients. On a medical rehabilitation ward, 15 stroke patients were evaluated for depression by psychiatric interview and self-report. Charts were examined for detection of depression by the rehabilitation team. The hypothesis was supported: in contrast to psychiatric interview (68% depressed) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory, 50% depressed), none of the patients were described as depressed in chart notes by the rehabilitation team (excluding the psychiatrists). Psychiatrists should develop ongoing interactions with primary care physicians to improve detection of poststroke depression and other depressions on medical wards.
