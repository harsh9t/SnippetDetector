OBJECTIVE: To determine which screening instrument is most suitable for detecting depression in Chinese stroke patients. METHOD: A random sample of 60 Chinese subjects recruited from consecutively admitted patients with first-ever stroke to a rehabilitation facility were assessed using the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Psychiatric diagnoses, which served as a benchmark for the comparison of screening instruments, were made using the SCID-DSM-III-R. Rating instruments were compared with respect to response rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The VAMS was not useful in screening for depression in Chinese stroke patients while both the HADS and the GDS demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in detecting depression in Chinese stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Screening instruments for poststroke depression are culture-specific and even scales well established in other cultures should be tested before being used in clinical practice and research.
