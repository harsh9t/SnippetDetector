OBJECTIVE: To compare the tolerability of two different dose-initiation regimens of gabapentin for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures. BACKGROUND: Patient compliance is a key feature of successful outpatient pharmacologic therapy for epilepsy, and one aspect of compliance is simplicity of initiation. By using a rapid titration rate, leading to a rapid therapeutic gabapentin dose, perhaps there could be an improvement with compliance. METHODS: Male or female patients, at least 12 years old, with a recent history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, were randomized to receive gabapentin (following a blinded placebo period of an undisclosed number of days) as either a Slow initiation (300 mg day 1, 600 mg day 2, then 900 mg/day) or a Rapid initiation (900 mg/day immediately following the placebo lead-in). RESULTS: Starting gabapentin therapy at an initial therapeutic dosage of 900 mg/day is well tolerated by patients with epilepsy and is as safe as initiating with a titration schedule over 3 days. Of the four most common adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue), only one, dizziness, occurred more often in the nontitrated (Rapid initiation) group than in the titrated (Slow initiation) group. CONCLUSION: Initiation of gabapentin at 900 mg/day is as well tolerated as is a 3-day titration, except for a higher incidence of dizziness.
