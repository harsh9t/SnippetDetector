OBJECTIVE: To review the information available regarding the safety and tolerability of gabapentin (GBP) in the treatment of epilepsy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the reports in the literature on the safety, adverse effects and tolerance of GBP as treatment, used as monotherapy or associated with other drugs, in epilepsies in patients of all age groups, including children, adults and the elderly. RESULTS: All published studies confirm that GBP is a well tolerated drug when used for monotherapy or associated with other antiepileptic drugs. The commonest adverse effects seen were somnolence, fainting, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor and headache. However, their incidence was low and intensity mild. There was no clear relationship between the dose given and appearance of side effects, except for fainting and somnolence. CONCLUSIONS: GBP is a drug which is free of unwanted side effects. Its safety and tolerability profile is excellent for treatment of simple and complex partial crises, with or without generalization in epileptic patients of all ages.
