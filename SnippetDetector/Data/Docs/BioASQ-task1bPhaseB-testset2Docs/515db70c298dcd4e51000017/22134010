OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of gabapentin as an add-on therapy in children presenting with overactive bladder (OAB) not responding to conventional anticholinergics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with refractory OAB were included prospectively from March 2009 to February 2010. The inclusion criterion was persistence of symptoms while on conventional anticholinergics for 6 months. Gabapentin was prescribed as an add-on therapy. The patients were followed 4 weekly with bladder diary and urodynamic study was repeated at 3 months. RESULTS: There were 31 children, 26 of neurogenic OAB and 5 of non-neurogenic origin. Mean ± SD age was 8.5 ± 5.3 years. Data were analyzed in 30 patients as treatment was terminated in 1 due to adverse effects. Continence improved in 16 (53.3%) patients. Voiding volume improved from 175 ± 90 to 320 ± 110 ml (p<0.03). Objective assessment of OAB symptom relief showed marked improvement (p<0.05). Mean maximum cystometric bladder capacity improved from 210 ± 94 to 360 ± 110 ml (p<0.02). The maximal detrusor contraction decreased from 75 ± 35 to 25 ± 15 cmH(2)O (p<0.02). Fourteen patients (46.7%) failed to respond to gabapentin therapy. These patients had baseline maximum cystometric bladder capacity <60% for age and maximum detrusor contractions >50 cm of water (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin gives moderate results in children with OAB refractory to conventional anticholinergics. In general, the drug is well tolerated with fewer adverse effects.
