<abstract>
Gabapentin (GBP) is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) approved for adjunctive treatment of complex partial seizures with or without seizures secondarily generalization in adults. We report 2 children who received GBP for intractable seizures and who developed intolerable aggressive behavior requiring dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Behavioral changes should be recognized as a possible side effect of GBP, especially in mentally retarded children.
