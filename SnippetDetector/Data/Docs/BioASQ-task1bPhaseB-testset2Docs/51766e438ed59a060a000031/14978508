Selenoprotein synthesis is conserved from bacteria to man. It involves the differential decoding of the UGA stop codon as selenocysteine. The proteomes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with the exception of yeast, contain only few selenoproteins. This low number is explained by a counterselection of readily oxidized selenocysteine after the introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere and the need to conserve selenoenzymes that control redox homeostasis of cells. Lack of selenoprotein synthesis in vertebrates impairs the oxidative stress defence and causes lethality. Here we show that Drosophila mutants that lack the translation elongation factor SelB/eEFsec fail to decode the UGA codon as selenocysteine, but they are viable and fertile. Oxidative stress responses and the lifespan of these flies are not affected. Protecting cells from oxidative stress can therefore not account for the selection pressure that conserves selenoprotein biosynthesis during the course of evolution.
