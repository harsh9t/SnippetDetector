AIM: Over 30% of patients with major depression do not respond well to first-line treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Using genome-wide expression profiling of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) CHL1 was identified as a tentative SSRI sensitivity biomarker. This study reports on miRNAs implicated in SSRI sensitivity of LCLs. METHODS: Eighty LCLs were screened from healthy adult female individuals for growth inhibition by paroxetine. Eight LCLs exhibiting high or low sensitivities to paroxetine were chosen for genome-wide expression profiling with miRNA microarrays. RESULTS: The miRNA miR-151-3p had 6.7-fold higher basal expression in paroxetine-sensitive LCLs. This corresponds with lower expression of CHL1, a target of miR-151-3p. The additional miRNAs miR-212, miR-132, miR-30b*, let-7b and let-7c also differed by >1.5-fold (p < 0.05) between the two LCL groups. CONCLUSION: The potential value of these miRNAs as tentative SSRI response biomarkers awaits validation with lymphocyte samples of major depression patients.
