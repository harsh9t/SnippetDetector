DNA methylation and histone acetylation are major epigenetic modifications in gene silencing. In our previous research, we found that the methylated oligonucleotide (SurKex) complementary to a region of promoter of survivin could induce DNA methylation in a site-specific manner leading to survivin silencing. Here, we further studied the role of histone acetylation in survivin silencing and the relationship between histone acetylation and DNA methylation. First we observed the levels of histone H4 and H4K16 acetylation that were decreased after SurKex treatment by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Next, we investigated the roles of histone acetylation and DNA methylation in survivin silencing after blockade of histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A (TSA). We assessed survivin mRNA expression by RT-PCR, measured survivin promoter methylation by bisulfite sequencing and examined the level of histone acetylation by the ChIP assay. The results showed that histone deacetylation blocked by TSA reversed the effects of SurKex on inhibiting the expression of survivin mRNA, inducing a site-specific methylation on survivin promoter and decreasing the level of histone acetylation. Finally, we examined the role of histone acetylation in the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) mRNA. The results showed that histone deacetylation blocked by TSA reversed the increasing effect of histone deacetylation on the expression of survivin mRNA. This study suggests that histone deacetylation guides SurKex-induced DNA methylation in survivin silencing possibly through increasing the expression of DNMT1 mRNA.
