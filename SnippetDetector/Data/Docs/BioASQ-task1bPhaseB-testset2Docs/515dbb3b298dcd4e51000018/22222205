Relatively little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of the Drosha/DGCR8 complex, which processes miRNAs at the initial step of biogenesis. We found that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) increases the expression levels of mature miRNAs despite repressing the transcription of host genes. HDAC1 is an integral component of the Drosha/DGCR8 complex and enhances miRNA processing by increasing the affinity of DGCR8 to primary miRNA transcripts via deacetylation of critical lysine residues in the RNA-binding domains of DGCR8. This finding suggests that HDACs have two arms for gene silencing: transcriptional repression by promoter histone deacetylation and post-transcriptional inhibition by increasing miRNA abundance.
