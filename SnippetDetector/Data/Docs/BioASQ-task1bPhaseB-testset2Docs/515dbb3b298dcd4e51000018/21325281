The etiology of a variety of chronic inflammatory disorders has been attributed to the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Herein, we identified a link between epigenetic regulation and IL-13-driven eotaxin-3 in the pathogenesis of chronic allergic inflammation. We first demonstrated that the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) site in the eotaxin-3 promoter affects IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 promoter activity. Furthermore, the CRE-binding protein-binding protein (CBP), a histone acetyltransferase, induced base-line and IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 promoter activity. Additionally, IL-13 treatment promoted global histone 3 acetylation as well as the formation of a complex containing CBP and STAT6 and the subsequent acetylation of histone 3 at the eotaxin-3 promoter. CBP gene silencing decreased IL-13-induced transcription of eotaxin-3. Conversely, inhibition of histone deacetylation increased IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 production. Clinical studies demonstrated markedly increased global acetylation of histone 3 in the inflamed tissue of patients with allergic inflammation. Collectively, these results identify an epigenetic mechanism involving CBP and chromatin remodeling in regulating IL-13-induced chemokine transcription.
