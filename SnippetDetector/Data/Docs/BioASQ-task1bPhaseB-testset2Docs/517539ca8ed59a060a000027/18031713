An altered thyroid hormone profile has been reported in patients with congestive heart failure. However, information regarding the status of thyroid hormone receptors in human failing cardiomyocytes is lacking. Therefore the expression of thyroid hormone and beta-adrenergic receptors was investigated in human ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from patients with end-stage heart failure (FM, n=12), or from tentative donors (C, n=4). The expression of thyroid (TRalpha1, and TRbeta1) and beta-adrenergic receptors (ARB1 and ARB2) was measured at both the gene, and at the protein level. In FM the reduced mRNA expression of ARB1 (p<0.05, -37%) and ARB2 (p<0.05, -42%) was associated with a reduction of the messenger for TRalpha1 (p<0.05, -85%) and TRalpha2 (p<0.05, -73%). These findings were confirmed at the protein level for ARB1, ARB2 and TRalpha1. These data reveal that in human heart failure the reduction of beta-adrenergic receptors is associated with reduced expression of both TRalpha1 and TRalpha2 isoforms of thyroid hormone receptors.
