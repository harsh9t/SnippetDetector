The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 loss-of-function allele has been associated with impaired clopidogrel response and worse prognosis in clopidogrel-treated patients. The benefit of tailored therapy according to platelet function test results remains unclear, and the potential effect of genotypes on this benefit has not been addressed in unstable patients. The present study was designed to evaluate the benefit of tailored therapy with a higher maintenance dose according to CYP2C19 genotypes in patients identified as nonresponders who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. Three hundred forty-six consecutive patients were enrolled and received a loading dose of 600 mg, including 86 *2 carriers (13 homozygotes and 73 heterozygotes) and 260 *2 noncarriers. Clopidogrel response, assessed with platelet reactivity index vasoactive-stimulated phosphoprotein, was significantly affected by genotype, with lower clopidogrel response in CYP2C19*2 allele carriers (p = 0.01). Accordingly, the rate of clopidogrel nonresponse was higher in CYP2C19*2 allele carriers (53% vs 41%, p = 0.04). All clopidogrel nonresponders (n = 151), including 105 *2 noncarriers and 46 *2 carriers, received high 150-mg clopidogrel maintenance doses at discharge to overcome initial low response. After 1 month, high maintenance doses overcame clopidogrel low response in only 44% of the whole population and significantly less frequently in *2 carriers than in noncarriers (28% vs 50%, p = 0.01). In conclusion, higher clopidogrel maintenance doses were able to overcome clopidogrel low response in fewer than half of clopidogrel low responders who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. The benefit of this tailored therapy was significantly reduced in CYP2C19*2 carriers. Therefore, these patients might require alternative strategies with new P2Y₁₂ blockers.
