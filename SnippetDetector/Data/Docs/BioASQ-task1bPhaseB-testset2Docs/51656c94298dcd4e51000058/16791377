The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that frequently presents early contractures and cardiac conduction defects, caused by emerin deficiency in the inner nuclear membrane of the muscular fibers. A 19-years-old man it presented muscle weakness and hypotrophy in the proximal upper and lower limbs, dysphagia and early contractures in elbows and ankles, with familiar history compatible with X-linked inheritance form. The investigation showed increased serum creatinekinase levels electrocardiogram had a first degree atrioventricular block and right bundle branch block normal electromyography and nerve conduction study muscle biopsy disclosed myopathic characteristics and nuclear protein immunohystochemical analysis showed deficiency of emerin. The clinical and genetics manifestations, laboratorial and electromyography changes, as well as, the study of the pattern of inheritance for genetic counseling are discussed.
