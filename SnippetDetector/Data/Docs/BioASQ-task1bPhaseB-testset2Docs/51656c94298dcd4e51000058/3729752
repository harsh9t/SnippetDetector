<abstract>
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a syndrome with five salient features: early and unusual contractures; humeroperoneal muscle wasting; the slow progression of weakness, beginning in childhood; cardiac conduction defects; and X-linked inheritance. We present two cases and detail other reports with a similar constellation of findings with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance. We postulate separate genetic disorders with similar phenotypic expression.
