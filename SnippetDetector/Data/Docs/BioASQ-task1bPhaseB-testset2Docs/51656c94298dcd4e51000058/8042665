Two familial and 2 sporadic cases of Emery-Dreifuss syndrome are reported. One family presented a rare autosomal dominant variant of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, another with X-linked recessive inheritance showed unusual intrafamilial variability. One of sporadic cases closely resembled rigid spine syndrome, the other was clinically intermediate between Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and rigid spine syndrome, showing that they are not distinct disorders.
