OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histopathologic picture of a childhood-onset, severe variant of scapuloperoneal MD with rigidity of the spine. BACKGROUND: Rigidity of the spine is a feature of numerous syndromes, including X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD, Bethlem myopathy, and the rigid spine syndrome. These are, however, relatively static or very slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders, usually associated with preserved ambulation into adult life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five unrelated children (three boys and two girls) presented in the first 2 years of life with poor neck control, waddling gait, and frequent falls. Early wasting of the distal leg muscles, biceps, triceps, and neck muscles was noted in all patients, and all had contractures and severe rigidity of the spine. The condition progressed rapidly, and all patients lost ambulation before the age of 8 years. Cardiac function was normal in all. RESULTS: Creatine kinase was moderately elevated in all, and muscle biopsy specimens showed nonspecific dystrophic changes with normal expression of dystrophin, the sarcoglycans, and laminin alpha2, alpha5, beta1, and gamma1 chains. Emerin expression was normal in two of the boys whose tissue was available for study. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of weakness, wasting, and contractures of the patients described resembled Emery-Dreifuss MD, but the rapid progression of weakness and contractures and the involvement of both sexes together with normal emerin expression suggest that this form is not X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD. We suggest that these patients represent a severe MD characterized by early onset distal wasting and severe rigidity of the spine, with probable autosomal recessive inheritance.
