We reviewed therapeutic effects and harmful side effects in 33 patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer who underwent treatment with Anastrozole 1 mg/day in our department. The patients ranged in age from 40 to 83 years old (median, 59). The Performance Status was 0-2, and there was 1 case of advanced breast cancer and 32 cases of recurrent breast cancer. The duration of disease was from 5 to 233 months (median, 50 months). The estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive rate was 72.7%. Metastatic sites were in multiple organs in 9 cases, in the lung only in 1 case, in bone only in 12 cases, and in soft tissue only in 10 cases. First-line therapy was used in 10 cases, second-line therapy in 6 cases, and above third-line therapy in 17 cases. There was a complete response in 3 cases, partial response in 5 cases, no long change in 13 cases, no change in 9 cases, and progressive disease in 3 cases. The response rate was 24.3%, The response period ranged from 2 to 22 months (median, 8 months), and clinical benefit was achieved in 63.7%. The clinical benefit rates for first-line were 60%, second-line 83.3% and above third-line therapy 58.8%. The response rate for patients with breast cancer resistant to Anthracyclines and/or Taxanes was 20%. Time-to-progression ranged from 2 to 28 months (median, 11 months), and overall survival ranged from 7 to 30 months (median, 15 months). The most frequent harmful side effects were rise in total cholesterol, general fatigue, hot flashes and arthralgia (9.1%). In this study, we confirmed the availability and safety of Anastrozole, which was suggested to be a useful drug in salvage therapy for patients having resistance to Anthracyclines and/or Taxanes, not only but also useful as a first- or second-line therapy.
