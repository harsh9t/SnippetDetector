Less than 1% of breast cancers occur in males, and the optimal hormonal therapy in this setting is unknown. Tamoxifen is effective in this entity, but unfortunately there is little information on aromatase inhibitors (AI) or fulvestrant. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). In this report we report 11 months of progression-free survival, without any adverse events, in a patient who received trastuzumab and anastrozole therapy. We conclude that this combination is a reasonable option in men with ER+ and Her2+ advanced breast cancer.
