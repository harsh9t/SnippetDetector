We report a 67-year-old man presenting with abdominal pain of acute onset, pallor, jaundice and behavioral changes after ingestion of fava beans. In the initial evaluation he appeared acutely ill and had resting dyspnea, edema and jaundice. His initial laboratory assessment disclosed azotemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, a low hemoglobin concentration (4.9 /dL) and a high corrected reticulocyte count (4,7%) with negative direct and indirect Coombs' test. The patient was transferred to the ICU, where he received support therapy with hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs and transfusions of packed red cells. The evolution after 1 month was favorable and he was discharged without anemia and with normal renal function. Three months after discharge, the glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase screening study did not demonstrate detectable enzymatic activity.
