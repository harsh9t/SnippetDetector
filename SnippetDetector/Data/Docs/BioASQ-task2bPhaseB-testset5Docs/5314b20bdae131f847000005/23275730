We performed a study to evaluate the role of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), factor V Leiden G1691A (FVL), prothrombin gene mutation G20210A (PRT or FII-G20210A) and methylenotetrahydrofolate reductase variant C677T (MTHFRC677T), as risk factors for G6PD in Saudi populations. Our results did not show any association with the three Thrombophilic genes with FVL gene, no statistical analysis have shown any association with either allele or genotype frequencies OR=0.566, p=.0.667, (95% CI=0.014-22.48) and OR=0.569, p=0.251¸ (95% CI=0.014-22.96).In PRT gene G20210A for G Vs A, p=0.774; OR=0.566 (95%CI; 0.011-29.6); AA+GA Vs GG; p=0.502; OR=0.569 (95%CI=0.010-2969). G and A allele frequencies were similar between cases and controls with no statistical significance. In the MTHFR gene none of the genotypes or allele frequency cannot show any association OR=1.281, p=.0.667, (95% CI=0.414-3.958) and OR=1.1.172, p=0.800¸ (95% CI=0.343-4.008). Similarly, the difference of T allele frequencies between patients and controls was not found any association. In conclusion, our finding indicates that the prevalence of G1691A, G20210A and C677T mutations in G6PD deficient individuals is not statistically different compared to normal subjects and G6PD is not associated with these thrombophilic mutations in Saudi population.
