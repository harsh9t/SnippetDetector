Protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification where peptidylarginine is enzymatically deiminated to form peptidylcitrulline. Although the role of protein citrullination in both health and disease is being increasingly recognised, techniques available to identify citrullinated proteins and to map their citrullination site(s) are rare and often show poor sensitivity. Here, we present a sensitive technique for specific modification and selective enrichment of citrullinated peptides from complex biological samples. The technique is based on highly specific in-solution biotinylation of citrulline residues followed by selective enrichment of modified peptides using streptavidin beads. We demonstrate that a synthetic citrulline-containing peptide can be selectively enriched when less than 0.5 pmol is spiked into a highly heterogeneous peptide mixture. After enrichment, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of an aliquot of the streptavidin eluate corresponding to theoretically 50 fmol of the spiked-in peptide showed a prominent signal. We further demonstrate the sensitivity of our technique by enrichment of citrullinated peptides from enzymatically deiminated myelin basic protein (MBP), when 10 pmol was spiked into a heterogeneous biological digest. In MALDI-TOF MS analysis, six MBP-derived citrullinated peptides were observed, showing the efficiency of this enrichment strategy. The high sensitivity combined with the remarkable specificity of the described technique makes it a valuable tool for elucidating citrullination in various biological processes.
