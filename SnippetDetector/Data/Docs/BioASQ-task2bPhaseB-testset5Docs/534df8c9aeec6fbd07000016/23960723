The aim of the present work was to study the effect of tobacco smoking on disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis patients and its relation to anti-cyclical citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. The study included 54 patients; 20 non-smokers, 9 ex-smokers, 14 mild to moderate smokers and 11 heavy smokers. Fifteen normal volunteers were also studied as controls. Disease stage was clinically and radiologically determined, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies were measured in serum. Higher percentage of severe disease (stage III) was seen in heavy smoker patients than mild to moderate smokers (54.6% versus 35.7%) and in moderate smokers than ex-smokers (35.7% versus 33.6%). Lowest percentage of severe disease was seen in non-smokers (15%). RF and anti-CCP were significantly higher in smoker than non-smoker and in heavy than mild to moderate smoker patients (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). In smoker patients, both RF and anti-CCP antibodies correlated significantly and positively with smoking index (r = 0.581, p < 0.001; r = 0.661, p < 0.001). Also, smoking index and anti-CCP correlated significantly and positively with disease stage (r = 0.424, p < 0.05; r = 0.523, p < 0.01). It appears from our results that, tobacco smoking mostly play a role in progression of rheumatoid arthritis through tissue protein citrullination. So all rheumatoid arthritis patients must quit completely to achieve a good control.
