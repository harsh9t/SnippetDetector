Haspin is an atypical protein kinase that in several organisms phosphorylates histone H3Thr3 and is involved in chromosome segregation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H3Thr3 phosphorylation has never been observed and the function of haspin is unknown. We show that deletion of ALK1 and ALK2 haspin paralogs causes the mislocalization of polarisome components. Following a transient mitotic arrest, this leads to an overly polarized actin distribution in the bud where the mitotic spindle is pulled. Here it elongates, generating anucleated mothers and binucleated daughters. Reducing the intensity of the bud-directed pulling forces partially restores proper cell division. We propose that haspin controls the localization of polarity cues to preserve the coordination between polarization and the cell cycle and to tolerate transient mitotic arrests. The evolutionary conservation of haspin and of the polarization mechanisms suggests that this function of haspin is likely shared with other eukaryotes, in which haspin may regulate asymmetric cell division.
