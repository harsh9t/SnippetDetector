Aurora B localization to mitotic centromeres, which is required for proper chromosome alignment during mitosis, relies on Haspin-dependent histone H3 phosphorylation and on Bub1-dependent histone H2A phosphorylation--which interacts with Borealin through a Shugoshin (Sgo) intermediate. We demonstrate that Mps1 stimulates the latter recruitment axis. Mps1 activity enhances H2A-T120ph and is critical for Sgo1 recruitment to centromeres, thereby promoting Aurora B centromere recruitment in early mitosis. Importantly, chromosome biorientation defects caused by Mps1 inhibition are improved by restoring Aurora B centromere recruitment. As Mps1 kinetochore localization reciprocally depends on Aurora B, we propose that this Aurora B-Mps1 recruitment circuitry cooperates with the Aurora B-Haspin feedback loop to ensure rapid centromere accumulation of Aurora B at the onset of mitosis.
