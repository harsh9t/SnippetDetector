Although the association between alopecia areata (AA), psoriasis, and other autoimmune diseases has been well reported in the literature, an association with metabolic syndrome has not been reported. We present two young women with the combination of severe psoriasis, androgen excess, metabolic syndrome, thyroiditis, and AA. Both women ultimately progressed to treatment-resistant alopecia universalis. This constellation of autoimmunity and metabolic syndrome presents a therapeutic challenge while highlighting the need for full laboratory assessment of AA patients. Careful selection of biological treatment regimens may offer therapeutic benefit for both their psoriasis and AA while giving us experience with the newer biologics in AA.
