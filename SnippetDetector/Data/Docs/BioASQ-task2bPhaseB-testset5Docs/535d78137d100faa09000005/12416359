Smoking is one of the main causes of poor health and early death. In line with the 1999 law which aims at reducing smoking, we have tested auriculotherapy as an aid for giving up smoking. We tried this treatment on 39 people who wanted to give up smoking. After two months of treatment, 15 people (38.5%) had given up completely and 24 people had reduced their smoking by more than half. Auriculotherapy is an useful aid for giving up smoking. It is easy and painless, has no secondary effects and it is economic.
