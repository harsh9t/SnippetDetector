<abstract>
Microinjection has a long and distinguished history in Xenopus and has been used to introduce a surprisingly diverse array of agents into embryos by both intra- and intercellular means. In addition to nuclei, investigators have variously injected peptides, antibodies, biologically active chemicals, lineage markers, mRNA, DNA, morpholinos, and enzymes. While enumerating many of the different microinjection approaches that can be taken, we will focus upon the mechanical operations and options available to introduce mRNA, DNA, and morpholinos intracellularly into early stage embryos for the study of neurogenesis.
