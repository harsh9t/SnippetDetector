Nonviral delivery is a promising strategy for cellular reprogramming to produce desired cell types from undifferentiated stem cells or terminally differentiated somatic cells. Nonviral delivery of genes (DNA, RNA), proteins, or peptides has the potential to reprogram somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells or other lineage cells, and to promote the differentiation of stem cells to specific lineages. Various delivery carriers (cationic polymers, lipids, scaffolds, transposons, cell-penetrating peptides), cargos (episomal plasmids, minicircle DNA, small interfering RNAs, microRNAs, proteins, peptides), and method (electroporation) have been reported. In this article, we review recent advances in nonviral delivery approaches for reprogramming cells to pluripotency or lineage specification.
