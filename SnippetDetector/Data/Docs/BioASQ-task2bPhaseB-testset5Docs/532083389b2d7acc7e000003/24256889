For the last 60 years, only a few cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) have been detected in Bulgaria. Considering the remarkable increase in TBE morbidity in Europe over the past two decades, we conducted a study of TBE among patients with acute viral meningitis who were hospitalised in Bulgaria during 2009 to 2012. A total of 86 patients with viral meningitis of unknown aetiology during this period were tested. Acute TBE was confirmed in three of these patients. The last TBE case was detected in October 2012; the other two were diagnosed in 2009. To the best of our knowledge, these three patients are the first confirmed TBE cases reported in Bulgaria. The risk of TBE is underestimated in Bulgaria due to the low awareness of medical doctors.
