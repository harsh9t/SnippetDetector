Conventional medical thought several decades ago was to restrict the amount of calcium intake in individuals with a history of calcium oxalate stones. In the past decade, several studies have suggested that increasing the intake of calcium may actually reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. The largest randomized trial of diet and stone recurrence was recently completed. Interestingly, individuals that had normal calcium intakes and lower intakes of protein and salt had a significantly reduced rate of calcium oxalate stone recurrence. This recent trial along with several past epidemiologic studies should be discussed with patients at high risk of stone recurrence. Currently, health professionals have a wealth of information that can be distributed to individuals at high risk of nephrolithiasis, and simple dietary recommendations may be one of the best ways to reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stones.
