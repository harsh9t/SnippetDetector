<abstract>
Childhood urolithiasis is an evolving condition with an increasing incidence and prevalence over the last 2 decades. Over that time the underlying cause has shifted from predominantly infectious to metabolic in nature. This review describes the pathophysiology, underlying metabolic abnormalities, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of childhood urolithiasis. A comprehensive metabolic evaluation is essential for all children with renal calculi, given the high rate of recurrence and the importance of excluding inherited progressive conditions.
