Bladder cancer is a common cancer in the Western world. The current prognosticators such as tumor grade, stage, size, and multifocality do not accurately reflect the clinical outcome. It is of clinical interest to identify biomarkers that could improve diagnostic and/or prognostic predictions. The objectives of this study were to identify deregulated miRNAs in bladder cancer samples and evaluate their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. We screened 723 miRNAs by microarray and selected a subset of 15 distinctively deregulated miRNAs for further validation by real-time quantitative RT-(q)PCR. Seven miRNAs (miR-20a, miR-106b, miR-130b, miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200a*, and miR-205) were found to be up-regulated and eight miRNAs (miR-100, miR-125b, miR-130a, miR-139-5p, miR-145*, miR-199a-3p, miR-214, and miR-222) were found to be down-regulated in malignant bladder tissue samples compared to healthy tissue. Four miRNAs that have already been described in the literature (miR-141, miR-199a-3p, miR-205, and miR-214) were significantly differentially expressed between nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Furthermore, real-time RT-qPCR of all miRNAs provided high overall correct classification (>75%) of bladder cancer diagnosis. Two miRNAs (miR-141 and miR-205) were associated with overall survival time. The verification of tumor-specific miRNA expression profile, together with the observed association of miR-141 and miR-205 expression with overall survival, underline the potential of miRNAs to function as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers of bladder cancer.
