INTRODUCTION: Ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been developed for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in postmenopausal women. AIM: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug for treating dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ospemifene for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. The search included the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six publications involving a total of 1,772 patients were used in the analysis, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were short-term (12 weeks) comparisons of ospemifene with placebo and three RCTs that were long-term (1 year) comparisons of ospemifene with placebo. RESULTS: For the comparison of short-term ospemifene with placebo, parabasal cells (the standardized mean difference [SMD] = -37.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI = 7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001) indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo. For the comparison of long-term ospemifene with placebo, endometrial thickness (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.58 to 1.23, P = 0.00001), treatment emergent adverse event, discontinuations due to adverse event, and serious adverse event indicated that ospemifene was generally safe. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that ospemifene to be an effective and safe treatment for dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy.
