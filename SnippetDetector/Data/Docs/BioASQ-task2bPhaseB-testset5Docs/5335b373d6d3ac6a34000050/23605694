Ospemifene (Osphenaâ„¢) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), with tissue-specific estrogenic agonist/antagonist effects. QuatRx Pharmaceuticals conducted the global development of the agent before licensing it to Shionogi for regulatory filing and commercialization worldwide. Ospemifene is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The drug is approved in the USA, and application for EU regulatory approval is underway. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy.
