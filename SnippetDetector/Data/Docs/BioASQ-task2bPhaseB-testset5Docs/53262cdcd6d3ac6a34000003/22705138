<abstract>
Low pressure headache typically occurs as a complication of dural puncture. "Spontaneous" low pressure headache is a relatively rare but under-recognised cause of intractable headache. Clinical suspicion of this condition warrants imaging of the brain to confirm the diagnosis; spinal imaging may be needed to identify the site of the leak. Epidural blood patching may be necessary to seal the leak - CT fluoroscopy may be helpful in delivering the patch directly to the site of the leak. Surgical intervention may be required in intractable cases. We describe a patient with spontaneous intracranial hypotension and review the clinical and radiological features of this syndrome.
