<abstract>
Headaches complicating lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement have been attributed to shunt failure with resultant high intracranial pressure or to overdrainage with resultant low intracranial pressure. In this case, a 17-yr-old girl had symptoms of a low-pressure headache after LP shunt placement alleviated by an epidural blood patch. The success of this therapy suggests postdural puncture as a possible cause for low-pressure headache after LP shunt placement. Epidural blood patch may be an alternative initial therapy for some low-pressure headaches after LP shunt placement.
