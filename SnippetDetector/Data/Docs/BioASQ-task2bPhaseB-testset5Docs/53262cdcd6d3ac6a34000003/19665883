Women presenting with low pressure post-partum headache following neuraxial techniques are frequently offered an epidural blood patch, despite its inherent risks. We present two parturients with classical symptoms of low-pressure headache, who each received neuraxial labour analgesia without a documented dural puncture with a Tuohy needle. Both parturients were successfully managed using acupuncture rather than an epidural blood patch.
