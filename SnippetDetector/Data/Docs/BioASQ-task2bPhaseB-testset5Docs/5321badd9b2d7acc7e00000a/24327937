UNLABELLED: CD4(+) T cells promote cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anticancer immune responses. We have recently identified ideal tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-derived long peptides (LPs) that elicit not only TAA-specific TH1 response, but also CTLs, through cross-presentation. The LP-specific TH1 cell responses were augmented in cancer patients vaccinated with CTL epitopes. Our findings support the clinical application of LP-based immunotherapy.
