BACKGROUND: Post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) consolidation and maintenance therapies in multiple myeloma (MM) have recently been the central focus of studies. However, there have been no reports of Japanese patients with MM treated with post-ASCT consolidation/maintenance therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated eight Japanese patients with newly-diagnosed symptomatic MM who received ASCT after high-dose melphalan, and three to four courses of bortezomib-plus-dexamethasone and two courses of lenalidomide-plus-dexamethasone followed by maintenance lenalidomide for 6-24 months. RESULTS: Four patients achieved complete response (CR) after ASCT, and five patients (63%) achieved stringent CR after the consolidation and maintenance therapy; two out of these five were in molecular CR. At the median follow-up of 38 months, all patients were alive and only one patient had disease progression following post-ASCT therapy. CONCLUSION: Post-ASCT consolidation and maintenance therapy using lenalidomide may be effective in the treatment of Japanese patients with MM.
