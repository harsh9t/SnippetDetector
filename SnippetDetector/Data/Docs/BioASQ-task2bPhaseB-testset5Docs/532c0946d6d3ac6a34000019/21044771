Databases which are useful for proteomic analysis of human kidney tissue and urine have been discussed in this article. Integration of the gene-centric and protein-centric general databases with those of human kidney tissue and urine proteomes may open a new window for research in nephrology. Proteins present in the kidney and urine provide basic tools for investigation of kidney function and disease. By comparing such databases between the healthy and diseased populations, we may be able to identify the following: proteins involved in the development of renal disease, proteins involved in progression of CKD, or new biomarker candidate proteins for either the development of renal disease or the progression of CKD.
