The endocytosis of E-cadherin has recently emerged as an important determinant of cadherin function with the potential to participate in remodeling adhesive contacts. In this study we focused on the initial fate of E-cadherin when it predominantly exists free on the cell surface prior to adhesive binding or incorporation into junctions. Surface-labeling techniques were used to define the endocytic itinerary of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells and in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human E-cadherin. We found that in this experimental system E-cadherin entered a transferrin-negative compartment before transport to the early endosomal compartment, where it merged with classical clathrin-mediated uptake pathways. E-cadherin endocytosis was inhibited by mutant dynamin, but not by an Eps15 mutant that effectively blocked transferrin internalization. Furthermore, sustained signaling by the ARF6 GTPase appeared to trap endocytosed E-cadherin in large peripheral structures. We conclude that in isolated cells unbound E-cadherin on the cell surface is predominantly endocytosed by a clathrin-independent pathway resembling macropinocytotic internalization, which then fuses with the early endosomal system. Taken with earlier reports, this suggests the possibility that multiple pathways exist for E-cadherin entry into cells that are likely to reflect cell context and regulation.
