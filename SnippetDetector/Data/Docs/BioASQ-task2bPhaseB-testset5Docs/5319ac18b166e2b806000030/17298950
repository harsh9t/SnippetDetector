E-cadherin is a member of the cadherin family of Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules. E-cadherin associates with beta-catenin at the membrane-distal region of its cytosolic domain and with p120 at the membrane-proximal region of its cytoplasmic domain. It has been shown that a pool of cell surface E-cadherin is constitutively internalized and recycled back to the surface. Further, p120 knockdown by small interference RNA resulted in dose-dependent elimination of cell surface E-cadherin. Consistent with these observations, we found that selective uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin by introduction of amino acid substitutions in the p120-binding site increased the level of E-cadherin endocytosis. The increased endocytosis was clathrin-dependent, because it was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin or by hypertonic shock. A dileucine motif in the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain is required for E-cadherin endocytosis, because substitution of these residues to alanine resulted in impaired internalization of the protein. The alanine substitutions in the p120-uncoupled construct reduced endocytosis of the protein, indicating that this motif was dominant to p120 binding in the control of E-cadherin endocytosis. Therefore, these results are consistent with the idea that p120 regulates E-cadherin endocytosis by masking the dileucine motif and preventing interactions with adaptor proteins required for internalization.
