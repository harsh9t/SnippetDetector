OBJECTIVE: Human selenoprotein P (HSelP) is unique protein that contains 10 selenocysteines encoded by 10 inframe UGA, which typically function as stop codon. The function of HSelP remains unclear, in part due to the inability to express it by gene recombinant technique. This study is to investigate expression and purification of recombinant HSelP in prokaryotic expression system, and its activity to induce apoptosis in vitro. METHODS: The shorter HSelP isoform was cloned. After the selenocysteine (SeCys) at 40th position from N terminus of the HSelP shorter isoform was mutated into cysteine by PCR, it was expressed in E. coli. The expressed product was purified with DEAE column and identified by Western blot. Subsequently, its function on induction of mitochondrial apoptotic activity was studied. RESULTS: The mutant HSelP shorter isoform expressed in prokaryotic system was purified by DEAE column to 90% homogeneity. The purified product, HSelP280m, induced the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) and decreased the transmembrane potential in a dose-dependent manner. These events could be abolished by PTP specific inhibitors. CONCLUSION: HSelP280m can induce the opening of mitochondrial PTP, which provides a basis for investigating the structure and function of recombinant HSelP.
