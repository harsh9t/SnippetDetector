Selenoprotein P (SeP) is an extracellular glycoprotein with 8-10 selenocysteines per molecule, containing approximately 50% of total selenium in human serum. An antioxidant function of SeP has been postulated. In the present study, we show that SeP protects low-density lipoproteins (LDL) against oxidation in a cell-free in-vitro system. LDL were isolated from human blood plasma and oxidized with CuCl2, 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) (AAPH) or peroxynitrite in the presence or absence of SeP, using the formation of conjugated dienes as parameter for lipid peroxidation. SeP delayed the CuCl2- and AAPH-induced LDL oxidation significantly and more efficiently than bovine serum albumin used as control. In contrast, SeP was not capable of inhibiting peroxynitrite-induced LDL oxidation. The protection of LDL against CuCl2- and AAPH-induced oxidation provides evidence for the antioxidant capacity of SeP. Because SeP associates with endothelial membranes, it may act in vivo as a protective factor inhibiting the oxidation of LDL by reactive oxygen species.
