Cellular movement is mainly orchestrated by actin-dependent cytoskeleton in which Rho GTPase Rac1 or vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) closely collaborates. In the present in vitro study, we investigated the inhibitory effect and underlying molecular mechanism of icariin, a pure extract of the traditional Chinese medicine Herba epimedii, on the invasive and migration properties of human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823. At 50% growth-inhibiting concentration, icariin significantly suppressed tumor cells migration and invasion, which were traceable to down-regulation of Rac1 and VASP. Together with icariin, the selected siRNA targeting Rac1 or VASP reinforced these inhibitory effects. Rac1-siRNA-dependent down-regulation of Rac1 led to a large drop in VASP expression, whereas VASP-siRNA led to a slight fall in Rac1 expression, implying that the amount of Rac1 may influence VASP expression level. Moreover, transfection with Rac1 plasmids pcDNA3-EGFP-Rac1-Q61L led to the enhancement in expression level of both Rac1 and VASP. These results indicate that icariin exerts negative effects on tumor cell invasion and migration via the Rac1-dependent VASP pathway and may be a potential anti-cancer drug.
