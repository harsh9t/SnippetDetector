<abstract>
Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension. We investigated the effect of cyclosporine (Cs) and rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its metabolites ACT-132577 and ACT-373898 in healthy male subjects. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to investigate interactions between macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 with human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). The clinical study (AC-055-111) was conducted as a two-part, one-sequence, crossover study. Ten subjects in each part received multiple-dose macitentan followed by multiple-dose co-administration of Cs (part A) or rifampin (part B). In the presence of Cs, steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time profiles during a dose interval (AUC(τ)) for macitentan and ACT-373898 increased 10% and 7%, respectively, and decreased 3% for ACT-132577. Steady-state AUC(τ) of macitentan and ACT-373898 in the presence of rifampin decreased 79% and 64%, respectively. For ACT-132577, no relevant difference in AUC(τ) between the two treatments was observed. Macitentan co-administered with Cs or rifampin was well tolerated. The complementary in vitro studies demonstrated no marked differences in uptake rates of macitentan and ACT-132577 between the wild-type and OATP over-expressing cells over the concentration range tested. Concomitant treatment with Cs did not have any clinically relevant effect on the exposure to macitentan or its metabolites, at steady-state. Concomitant treatment with rifampin reduced significantly the exposure to macitentan and its metabolite ACT-373898 at steady-state but did not affect the exposure to the active metabolite ACT-132577 to a clinically relevant extent.

Macitentan (ACT-064992) is an orally active, tissue-targeting dual endothelin ETA and ETB receptor antagonist (ERA) under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension (1, 2). In humans, macitentan shows a slow absorption; maximum plasma concentrations are achieved approximately 8Β h after administration. In addition to macitentan, two metabolites, ACT-132577 (depropylated metabolite) and ACT-373898 (carboxylic acid metabolite), have been identified in plasma with ACT-132577 being pharmacologically active. While the elimination half-life (t1/2) is approximately 16Β h for macitentan, ACT-132577 has a t1/2 of approximately 48Β h. ACT-373898 has a similar pharmacokinetic (PK) profile to macitentan. There are no notable differences in PK parameters of macitentan and its active metabolite between males and females and/or between Caucasian and Japanese subjects (3). In addition, macitentan can be given to subjects irrespective of food intake.
Early phase studies have shown macitentan to have a good safety and tolerability profile. The most frequently reported adverse event (AE) is headache (2,4).
Cyclosporine (Cs) and rifampin were used to investigate the role of metabolism and drug transport in the disposition of macitentan. The immunosuppressant Cs is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) (5), and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (6). Rifampin, an antibiotic mainly used for the treatment of tuberculosis, is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and an effective inhibitor of OATP (7β€“9). As the metabolism of macitentan mainly relies on CYP3A4, the influence of these two drugs on the PK of macitentan is of particular interest (10). In addition, drugβ€“drug interactions (DDIs) at the level of hepatic OATPs have been documented following co-administration of other structurally related ERAs and Cs (11,12). As Cs and rifampin may be used concomitantly with macitentan in clinical practice, we investigated in a two-part, one-sequence, crossover study the effect of multiple-dose Cs (part A) and rifampin (part B) on the PK of macitentan and its metabolites. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to investigate interactions between macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 with human OATP transporters.

ubjects. It was planned to enroll a total of 20 subjects, 10 in part A and 10 in part B. Healthy male subjects (based on medical history and screening examination) aged between 18 and 45Β years, with body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 28Β kg/m2, were eligible for this study. In addition, eligible subjects had to have hematology and clinical chemistry results within the normal range and negative results for drug and alcohol use at screening. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had received any drug with immunosuppressive potential within 6Β months preceding the screening examination or if they were administered any metabolic enzyme-inducing or enzyme-inhibiting drugs within the last 4Β weeks prior to the screening examination.The ethics committee, ComitΓ© de Protection des Personnes Ouest VI, located in Brest (France), approved the study protocol (study number AC-055-111), and all subjects gave written informed consent before any screening procedures were performed. The study was conducted in full conformity with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the EMEA Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95), and International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002).Clinical Study DesignThis phase 1, single-center, open-label, two-part, one-sequence crossover study consisted of two parts. Each part comprised two periods: period 1, multiple-dose treatment with macitentan, and period 2, multiple-dose treatment with macitentan and Cs (part A) or multiple-dose treatment with macitentan and rifampin (part B).An oral dose of 10Β mg macitentan once daily was assessed in this study, which corresponds to the maximum dose used in the ongoing phase 3 program. The use of a 30-mg loading dose on dayΒ 1 reduced the time to reach steady-state conditions of ACT-132577 (dayΒ 4 instead of dayΒ 7). In the single-ascending dose study, doses of up to 300Β mg had been well tolerated (2). In part A, after 5Β days administration of macitentan, subjects were co-administered oral doses of 100Β mg of Cs (1β€‰Γ—β€‰100Β mg capsule of NeoralΒ®) every 12Β h on daysΒ 6 through 17. The dose of 2β€‰Γ—β€‰100Β mg/day of Cs used in this study corresponds to approximately 2.9Β mg/kg/day for a 70-kg man. This is within the recommended range for transplantation indications, i.e., 2 to 6Β mg/kg/day, and is below the dose level of 5Β mg/kg/day known to potentially increase creatinine and hypertension side effects (13). Both drugs were administered after food.In part B, after 5Β days administration of macitentan, oral doses of 600Β mg rifampin (two capsules of 300Β mg RifadinΒ®) were co-administered once daily for 7Β days, on daysΒ 6 through 12. This dosing regimen is approved for the treatment of tuberculosis and is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for assessment of its enzyme-inducing effect (14,15). Since food intake has a significant effect on the PK of rifampin, drugs were administered under fasted conditions (1Β h before a meal).An End of Study examination, including vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests, took place 2Β weeks after the last PK blood sampling, i.e., on dayΒ 32 (Β±2Β days) of part A and on dayΒ 27 (Β±2Β days) of part B. A telephone safety follow-up for serious adverse events (SAEs) took place 30Β days after the last study drug administration.Trough concentrations of macitentan and its metabolites were determined in blood samples taken from daysΒ 1 to 17 (part A) and from daysΒ 1 to 12 (part B) prior to daily macitentan administration. Twenty-four-hour concentrationβ€“time profiles of macitentan and its metabolites on dayΒ 5 (96β€“120Β h) and dayΒ 17 (384β€“408Β h) (part A) or dayΒ 12 (264β€“288Β h) (part B) were determined in blood samples drawn immediately before and at 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 24Β h after macitentan administration.For each time point, approximately 3Β mL of blood was collected from the subject in tubes containing ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid. Within 30Β min after collection, the tubes were centrifuged at approximately 1,500Γ—g for 10Β min at 2Β°C to 8Β°C. The plasma was stored at β�’20Β°C until analysis.Bioanalytical Methods and PK AssessmentsQuantification of macitentan, ACT-132577, and ACT-373898 in plasma was performed by a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) method. Analytes were extracted from plasma by protein precipitation with ethanol (EtOH)/acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) containing the internal standards (polydeuterated analogs of macitentan, ACT-132577, and ACT-373898) and filtered through a protein precipitation plate (0.2Β ΞΌm pore size), before injection into the high performance liquid chromatography system. The samples were subsequently analyzed by triple-stage quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The concentrations of the analytes were determined using the internal standardization method. The square of the correlation coefficient (R2) was at least 0.9985 for macitentan, 0.9863 for ACT-132577, and 0.9932 for ACT-373898 in all runs. For macitentan, the inter-day precision (coefficient of variation) of control samples was β‰¤8.6%, and inter-day inaccuracy ranged from β�’4.3% to 5.3%. For ACT-132577, inter-day precision was β‰¤7.0%, and inter-day inaccuracy ranged from β�’5.7% to β�’2.0%. For ACT-373898, inter-day precision was β‰¤10.1%, and inter-day inaccuracy was in the range of β�’9.3% to 1.8%. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1Β ng/mL for macitentan and ACT-132577, and 0.5Β ng/mL for ACT-373898.The measured individual plasma concentrations of macitentan, ACT-132577, and ACT-373898 were used to calculate PK parameters by model-independent analysis, using the WinNonlin 6.1 or Phoenix software packages (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). The measured individual plasma concentrations immediately before the morning dose of macitentan were used to directly obtain trough concentrations (Ctr). The area under the plasma concentrationβ€“time curve (AUC) was calculated according to the linear trapezoidal rule, using the measured concentrationβ€“time values above the LLOQ.Safety AssessmentsTolerability and safety were evaluated by recording SAEs, AEs, clinical laboratory variables, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG during the study.Statistical AnalysisThe effect of Cs and rifampin on the steady-state area under the plasma concentration time curve during a dose interval (AUCΟ„) and Ctr of macitentan and its metabolites were explored using the ratio of geometric means and its 90% confidence intervals of macitentan + Cs (or macitentan + rifampin) versus macitentan. Tolerability and safety endpoints were analyzed descriptively.In Vitro ExperimentsChinese Hamster Ovary Cell CultureWild-type and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells over-expressing OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100Β IU/mL), and l-proline (0.05Β mg/mL) at 37Β°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The culture medium for transfected cells also contained geneticin (500Β ΞΌg/mL). For transport experiments, cells were seeded 1:10 or 1:20 on 8-cm2 tissue culture dishes (Vitaris, Zug, Switzerland) 3 to 4Β days before assaying. One day before the experiments, 5Β ΞΌM sodium butyrate (Sigmaβ€“Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) was also added.Transport ExperimentsTransport experiments with wild-type and transfected CHO cells were performed in parallel using two to three 8-cm2 tissue culture dishes for each concentration. After washing the cells three times with a pre-warmed (37Β°C) buffer (5.3Β mM KCl, 1Β mM NaH2PO4, 0.8Β mM MgSO4, 5.5Β mM d-glucose, 20Β mM HEPES, 116.4Β mM NaCl, pHΒ 7.4 at room temperature), uptake of a test compound was initiated by adding 1Β mL of the same buffer containing the test compound at desired concentration (as 14C-labeled alone or as a mixture with non-labeled test compound). The final concentration of organic solvent was 1% (v/v). Uptake of a test compound was stopped after incubation at 37Β°C for the desired duration by twice adding 2-mL aliquots of ice-cold buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland). Cells were then rapidly washed four times with approximately 2Β mL of ice-cold buffer and solubilized by the addition of 1Β mL of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. After incubation for at least 20Β min, cell lysate (0.5Β mL) was mixed with 5Β mL of scintillation cocktail IRGA Safe Plus (PerkinElmer, Zurich, Switzerland), and radioactivity was determined using a Tri-Carb 2300 TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Bioscience, Zurich, Switzerland). Aliquots of cell lysates (25Β ΞΌL) were used to determine the protein content of each sample using the Pierce BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay (Pierce Science, Lausanne, Switzerland) according to the supplier's protocol. BSA was used as standard.The inhibitory potential of macitentan and ACT-132577 on the cellular uptake of prototypical OATP substrates was investigated at a single substrate concentration (β‰¤Km) of 1Β ΞΌM atorvastatin for OATP1B1 and 5Β ΞΌM estrone-3-sulfate for OATP1B3. After incubation at 37Β°C for 40Β s (OATP1B1) and 90Β s (OATP1B3), the uptake was terminated by twice adding 2Β mL of ice-cold buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA. Afterwards, sample preparation and analysis were performed as outlined above.Data EvaluationIn order to determine uptake rates, cellular uptakes were normalized to total protein content and incubation time. Net OATP-mediated uptake rates were calculated as the difference in the uptake rates of the transfected and wild-type cells for each individual concentration. Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for uptake inhibition were determined by plotting the inhibitor concentration (logarithmic scale) against the net uptake rates and nonlinear regression using the equation:\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

All subjects were Caucasian. All completed the study as per protocol. None of the subjects (in parts A and B) were exposed to any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (including herbal medicines) for 3Β months prior to screening.PharmacokineticsPart AMean concentrationβ€“time profiles of macitentan, ACT-132577, and ACT-373898 in period 1 (multiple-dose macitentan treatment) followed by period 2 (multiple-dose co-administration of Cs) are shown in Fig.Β 1. In period 1, plasma concentrations of macitentan, ACT-132577, and ACT-373898 approached steady-state on dayΒ 5 (96Β h) of dosing. In the presence of Cs (period 2), no relevant changes in Ctr of macitentan and its metabolites were observed compared to macitentan treatment alone. The mean 24-h plasma concentrationβ€“time profiles at steady-state in the two periods, i.e., on dayΒ 5 (period 1) and dayΒ 17 (period 2), for macitentan and its metabolites were similar (Fig.Β 2).Fig. 1

Steady-state conditions were approximately attained on dayΒ 5 (96Β h) of dosing in the absence of rifampin. In the presence of rifampin treatment, Ctr of macitentan decreased from daysΒ 6 to 12, and new steady-state conditions were approached on dayΒ 12 (264Β h). A similar situation was observed for ACT-373898. The start of concomitant treatment of rifampin on dayΒ 6 caused an initial increase in Ctr of ACT-132577, which gradually decreased with continued dosing and approached steady-state concentrations on dayΒ 12 (264Β h) which were similar to the original steady-state concentrations. The comparison of 24-h plasma concentrationβ€“time profiles at steady-state in the two periods, i.e., on daysΒ 5 and 12, showed that concentrations of macitentan and ACT-373898 on dayΒ 12 were considerably lower than those on dayΒ 5 (Fig.Β 4). The differences in concentrations of ACT-132577 between daysΒ 5 and 12 were much smaller compared to those of macitentan and ACT-373898.Fig. 3

The ratio of geometric means and their 90% confidence limits of AUCΟ„ for ACT-132577 fell entirely within the FDA-recommended bioequivalence range of 0.80β€“1.25, whereas for macitentan and ACT-373898, they were completely outside of this range (TableΒ II).Tolerability and SafetyThere were no deaths, SAEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. None of the AEs led to a withdrawal or any change in the conduct of the study. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity and were resolved at the end of the study with no sequelae.In part A of the study, a total of 12 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred, of which three occurred during period 1, affecting three subjects (30%), and nine affecting six subjects (60%) occurred during period 2. The most frequently reported TEAE was headache, which affected one subject in period 1 and three subjects in period 2.In part B of the study, a total of eight TEAEs occurred, of which six occurred during period 1, affecting six subjects (60%), and two affecting two subjects (20%) occurred during period 2. The most frequently reported TEAE was headache, which affected five subjects in period 1 and two subjects in period 2.No clinically relevant treatment-related effects on vital signs, ECG variables, or clinical laboratory variables were detected in either part of the study.In Vitro ExperimentsTo assess whether macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 are substrates of human OATPs, time- and concentration-dependence assessments were performed in vitro. Rapid and comparable uptake of macitentan and ACT-132577 was observed in wild-type and OATP1B1 as well as OATP1B3 over-expressing CHO cells (Fig.Β 5). The uptake of macitentan into the wild-type, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 over-expressing cells after incubation for 40Β s was (mean Β± SD) 346β€‰Β±β€‰3, 362β€‰Β±β€‰6, and 387β€‰Β±β€‰11Β pmol/mg, respectively, and the uptake of ACT-132577 was 214β€‰Β±β€‰11, 237β€‰Β±β€‰7, and 288β€‰Β±β€‰10Β pmol/mg, respectively. No marked difference in uptake rate of macitentan and ACT-132577 between wild-type and OATP over-expressing cells was observed when the effect of different concentrations was tested (Fig.Β 6).Fig. 5Time course of cellular uptake of 3Β ΞΌM macitentan (a) and 3Β ΞΌM ACT-132577 (b) in wild-type (circles) and human OATP1B1 (squares) and OATP1B3 (triangles) over-expressing CHO cells.

he clinical study was conducted in two parts. n both parts, tr of macitentan and its metabolites were comparable in the absence of s or rifampin, and they were consistent with previous results (16).
art t has been shown that s may affect the  of numerous compounds through its inhibitory effect on 34 or  transporters (11,12,17β€“19). he results of a previously performed study investigating the interaction between macitentan and ketoconazole, a strong 34 inhibitor, showed a small effect of ketoconazole on the exposure to macitentan (approximately two-fold increase of the area under the plasma concentrationβ€“time curve from zero to infinity [0β€“β��]), which was not considered clinically relevant (10). ince s is a weaker 34 inhibitor than ketoconazole, a large effect of s on the exposure to macitentan through 34 inhibition was not expected. owever, in this study, the investigation of a potential increase in exposure to macitentan through inhibition of  transporters by s was of greater interest. he results showed that in the presence of s, the exposure to macitentan and its metabolites did not change to a clinically relevant extent, which indicates no significant interaction between these two drugs at the level of metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters such as .his finding is different from that reported for other s, such as ambrisentan or bosentan, which showed  involvement in the interaction of those s with s (11,12,19). he significant initial increase in exposure to bosentan seen in the presence of s in humans (a 30-fold increase after the first day of co-administration of s) was attributed not only to the inhibition of metabolizing enzymes but mainly to the inhibition of  by s and consequently reduced hepatic uptake (17). s may be used concomitantly with pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, particularly in those patients with connective tissue disease. n addition, calcineurin inhibitors, including s, are used to prevent host organ rejection during solid organ transplantation procedures. owever, calcineurin inhibitors can limit the success of kidney transplantation due to calcineurin inhibitor-mediated nephrotoxicity. ata from previous studies suggest that some s may attenuate s toxicity and may be useful in solid organ transplantation studies (20β€“22); in contrast to other s, macitentan does not show any interaction with s either at the level of  enzymes or at the level of  transporters. herefore, macitentan in combination with s has potential to be successful in organ transplantation without the need for macitentan dose adjustment.art n the presence of rifampin, exposure to macitentan decreased markedly. his indicates that the metabolism of macitentan is induced in the presence of rifampin, a strong inducer of 34. omplex interactions have been observed between rifampin and a number of drugs, including s, which are subject to both 34-mediated oxidation and -mediated hepatic uptake. hese studies have typically revealed a biphasic response characterized by an initial, transient increase in  plasma concentration with acute rifampin administration, presumably due to  inhibition, followed by reduction in exposure attributed to 34 induction (23β€“26). uch biphasic effects of rifampin are not observed with macitentan, which further demonstrates the absence of a contribution from  to the disposition of macitentan. he initial increase seen in trough concentrations of -132577 after the first doses of rifampin could be explained by an increase in macitentan metabolism at the level of 34, resulting in an increased transformation rate to -132577. ifampin has also been reported to be an inducer of conjugation enzymes, which render drugs more polar and facilitate their excretion (7). n humans, conjugation enzymes are involved in the elimination of -132577, which could in turn be induced by rifampin, accelerating the elimination of -132577. his hypothesis is supported by the observation that the exposure to -132577 after continued dosing (day. Β 12) was very similar to that without rifampin. OATP is unlikely to be involved in the initial increase of exposure to ACT-132577 based on the fact that concomitant treatment with Cs, also a major inhibitor of OATP, did not show the same effect. Since both rifampin and macitentan would be administered on a multiple-dose basis if used together, the exposure at steady-state (dayΒ 5 compared to dayΒ 12) is considered to be the most relevant comparison between the two treatment conditions.Macitentan and its metabolite ACT-132577 are both potent dual ERAs, and both contribute to the overall pharmacological effect of macitentan in vivo. ACT-132577 is approximately five-fold less potent than macitentan in vitro. However, systemic exposure in humans to ACT-132577 is 2.5-fold higher than to macitentan. Although the exposure to ACT-132577 at steady-state was not affected by concomitant treatment with rifampin, the approximately four-fold reduction in exposure to macitentan in the presence of rifampin might affect the overall pharmacological effect of the drug. Thus, reduced efficacy of macitentan in the presence of concomitant treatment with rifampin should be considered.The results from in vitro OATP studies support the observations from the clinical study. High cellular uptake rates of macitentan and ACT-132577 in wild-type cells as well as OATP over-expressing CHO cells suggest that their cellular uptake does not depend on human OATP transporters but is likely to be driven by passive diffusion. A small contribution from active uptake could not be totally excluded, however, although compared to the high passive component, it is considered not to be relevant. The present in vitro data give a possible mechanistic explanation why the concomitant administration of the potent OATP inhibitor Cs did not increase the exposure to macitentan and ACT-132577 to a clinically relevant extent and explain why Ctr of macitentan did not show any immediate increase in the presence of rifampin.The question whether macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 could act as a perpetrator in DDIs was also assessed in in vitro studies. Macitentan and ACT-132577 exhibited an inhibitory potency on OATP1B1-mediated uptake of atorvastatin, as well as OATP1B3-mediated uptake of estrone-3-sulfate. Comparing the IC50 values and total plasma concentrations of macitentan and ACT-132577 at steady-state in healthy subjects (approximately 0.63 and 1.5Β ΞΌM, respectively) during a 10-mg once-daily regimen and binding of macitentan and ACT-132577 to human plasma proteins in vitro (99.6% and 99.5%, respectively) indicates that the free steady-state concentration of macitentan and ACT-132577 is around 2.5 and 7.3Β nM, respectively. Since free steady-state macitentan and ACT-132577 plasma concentrations are around 2,490-fold lower than the lowest IC50 determined, it appears unlikely that treatment with macitentan will affect the PK of co-administered OATP substrates.Based on the guidance for industry issued in 2008 by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, ACT-373898, identified in the human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study, was considered as a second major circulating metabolite of macitentan (27,28) and, therefore, was also analyzed in the present study. However, in view of the more recently issued guidance by the International Conference on Harmonization in 2010 (29), ACT-373898 is no longer considered a major metabolite.Similar to previous phase 1 studies with macitentan, the most frequent TEAE was headache (2,4,10). In part A, no hypertension or AEs relating to renal function, which are associated with Cs treatment, were reported (13). Similarly in part B, no AEs associated with rifampin treatment were reported (14). Overall, tolerability of macitentan when administered concomitantly with Cs or rifampin was good. However, the small number of subjects limits the interpretation of safety data in both parts of the study, and more data in a larger patient population are necessary to evaluate adequately the safety of macitentan in combination with Cs and rifampin.
