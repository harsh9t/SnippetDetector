We report on a 12-year-old patient with Turcot Syndrome (Glioma polyposis). This patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis coli. Possible etiology and neurosurgical, clinically important characteristics of this rare syndrome, such as the young age of the patient and the relatively long survival time, will be discussed.
