A 45-year-old woman with anaplastic astrocytoma was clinically diagnosed with Turcot syndrome, and subsequently developed simultaneous neurocysticercosis and malignant transformation to glioblastoma. The parasitic cysts and glioblastoma were microsurgically removed. Histological examination of surgical specimens revealed neurocysticercosis between the normal brain tissue and glioblastoma. The clinical course and histological findings suggest that the parasitic infection and/or genetic changes contributed to the malignant transformation of the astrocytic tumour.
