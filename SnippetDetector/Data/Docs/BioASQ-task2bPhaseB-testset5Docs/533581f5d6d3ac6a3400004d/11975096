Turcot's syndrome, clinically characterized by the coincident occurrence of primary tumors of the colon and the central nervous system, can genetically be divided into two syndromes: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colon carcinoma (HNPCC). In the present case, a 60-year-old patient with glioblastoma multiforme and a history of hereditary malignomas is described as an example of a HNPCC-associated Turcot's syndrome. New molecular biological methods and results give deeper insight into clinical syndromes, and the better understanding improves diagnostics, therapy, and outcome estimations, even in rare diseases. In the present case, a new germinal mutation could be identified.
