We reported a case of Turcot Syndrome (glioma polyposis) in a 19-year-old woman with nonfamilial polyposis coli and adenocarcinoma of the colon, and grade 3 astrocytoma in the right parietal lobe. The patient was admitted with the complaint of general convulsion after colostomy for polyposis and adenocarcinoma of the colon. CT scans on admission showed a large parietal tumor in the right side. Total removal was performed successfully and histological examination showed astrocytoma grade 3. One year after the operation, the tumor recurred. Conservative treatment failed to improve her condition and she died one year later. Turcot Syndrome (glioma polyposis) is very rare and only 10 cases have been reported in Japan. In this report, the clinical characteristics of this syndrome were discussed.
