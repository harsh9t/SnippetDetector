A 67-year-old woman presented with hematochezia and an episode of transient expressive dysphasia. She was found to have multiple colonic polyps with adenocarcinomatous changes. Computed tomography brain scan and computed tomography-guided biopsy revealed a left frontoparietal glioblastoma multiforme. This case illustrates the rare presentation of Turcot syndrome-a hereditary colorectal polyposis syndrome-in an older adult.
