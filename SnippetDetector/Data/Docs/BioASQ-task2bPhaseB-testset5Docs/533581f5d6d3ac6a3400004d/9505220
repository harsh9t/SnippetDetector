<abstract>
The Turcot syndrome has been defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple polyposis of the colon and a malignant brain tumor. This association is supposed to be genetically transmitted, even though we still do not exactly know whether this occurs in a dominant or recessive way. The case of a 47-year-old man submitted to a right hemicolectomy for cancer and polyposis, following a series of endoscopic polypectomies and, finally, removal of left temporal glioma is here presented.
