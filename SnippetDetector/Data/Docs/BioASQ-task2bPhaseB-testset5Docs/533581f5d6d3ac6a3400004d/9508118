BACKGROUND: Turcot syndrome (TS) or the glioma-polyposis syndrome, is a rare, heritable disorder thought by some authors to be a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms and gastrointestinal polyposis. METHODS: We present a case report of a patient who developed a medulloblastoma at age 5 years. Ten years later, she developed adenocarcinoma of the colon. Seven months after resection of this Dukes' C2 adenocarcinoma, she presented with a second primary CNS tumor, a glioblastoma multiforme. The patient's colonic adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma were evaluated histologically and cytogenetically. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of chromosomal instability in both tumors. This unusual case of two primary CNS neoplasms in a patient with TS is presented with a review of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of the cytogenetic analysis are discussed in conjunction with the present knowledge of the molecular biology of TS.
