BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: EphrinB2 is a novel angiogenic factor. EphrinB2 and its receptor EphB4 express in several kinds of tumor cells,and correlate with tumorigenesis and neoangiogenesis. This study was designed to explore the characteristics of EphB4 and EphrinB2 protein expression in astrocytomas. METHODS: Double labelling immunofluorescence was used to detect co-expression of EphB4/EphrinB2 with glial fibrilary acid protein (GFAP)or CD34 protein in 35 fresh glioma specimens, and 2 kinds of human glioma cell lines (CHG-5,and SHG-44). RESULTS: EphB4/EphrinB2 and CD34 proteins co-expressed in some tumor stromal microvessels, and mainly localizing in endothelial cells. Co-expression of EphB4/EphrinB2 and GFAP proteins was also noticed in tumor cells,and 2 glioma cell lines. In poorly-differentiated SHG-44 cells, the average fluorescence intensity of EphB4 was 72.48+/-33.78,and that of EphrinB2 was 96.80+/-36.98, both higher than those in well-differentiated CHG-5 cells (56.7+/-21.7, and 53.6+/-18.8). But the green fluorescence intensity of GFAP in SHG-44 cells was 22.3+/-15.3, while in CHG-5 cells was 47.5+/-16.7. CONCLUSION: Expressions of EphB4 and EphrinB2 proteins may be related to differentiation degree of tumor cells.
