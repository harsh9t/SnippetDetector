Since the first report of amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), special attention has been given to the individuals who, though cognitively normal by testing, have substantial amounts of fibrillar amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology in their brain.(1) This state, previously predicted by several postmortem studies,(2) is also the focus of research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD).(3) With these criteria, the pathophysiologic spectrum of AD was stretched past the earliest clinically detectable stages such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI)(4) to include cognitively normal individuals who show evidence of brain amyloid deposition by CSF analysis or amyloid PET. This concept of preclinical AD currently forms the foundation of a trial aimed at preventing the emergence of AD in amyloid-positive individuals-the Anti-Amyloid Treatment of Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) trial.(5) Clearly, it is important to understand this state of asymptomatic β-amyloidosis as fully as possible.
