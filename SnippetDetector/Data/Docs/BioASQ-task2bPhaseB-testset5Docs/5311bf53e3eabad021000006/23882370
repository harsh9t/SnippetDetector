BACKGROUND: Early onset Alzheimer's type dementia (EOAD) is usually familial and associated with mutations in the Presenilin-1 (PSEN1), Presenilin-2 (PSEN2) or amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. It is rarely reported in patients of Hispanic descent. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old Hispanic male developed significant cognitive impairment over a 4-year period. PET scan showed diminished metabolic activity in the posterior parietal/temporal lobes. Genetic testing revealed the presence of a PSEN1 gene mutation. CONCLUSION: Disparities in health care may account for an under-recognition of EOAD in the Hispanic population. Clinicians should test for EOAD in all patients with appropriate symptomatology, regardless of ethnicity. Early recognition and enrollment in clinical trials is vital to enhancing our understanding of the natural history and treatment of this condition.
