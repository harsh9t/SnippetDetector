It has been shown that Wallerian degeneration, an anterograde degeneration of transected axons, is markedly delayed in a mutant mouse called slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(S)). These mice also show resistance to axonal degeneration caused by microtubule depolymerizing drugs, suggesting that axonal microtubules are stabilized. Here, we have focused on tubulin acetylation, a post-translational modification associated with microtubule stability. We found that the basal level of microtubule acetylation was increased in cultured cerebellar granule cells from Wld(S) mice. Nicotinamide but not 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin deacetylase, could modulate resistance to axonal degeneration. Indeed, the levels of NAD and SIRT2 were decreased in the cytoplasm from Wld(S) granule cells. Moreover, SIRT2 overexpression abrogated microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in these cells. Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown by using a lentiviral vector expressing small interfering RNA, enhanced microtubule acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in WT granule cells. Taken together, these results suggest that SIRT2-mediated tubulin deacetylation is involved in both microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in Wld(S) granule cells.
