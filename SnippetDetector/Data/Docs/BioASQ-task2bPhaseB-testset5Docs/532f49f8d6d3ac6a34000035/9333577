The demands made on prenatal care in terms of fetal anomaly recognition and full and early counseling have become more and more sophisticated over the last few years. Today, a range of non-invasive and invasive procedures are now available for the detection of fetal anomalies, genetic disorders and e.g. infection. The most important of the former are ultrasound and triple test (determination of alpha feto-protein, HCG and unconjugated estriol), while amniocentesis remains the major invasive measure. The indications, the information they provide, and possible risks of these procedures are discussed.
