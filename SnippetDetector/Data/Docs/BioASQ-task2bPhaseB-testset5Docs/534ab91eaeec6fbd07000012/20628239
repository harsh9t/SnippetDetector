AIM: We aimed to investigate the mechanisms of hepaCAM inactivation in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder through the analysis of hepaCAM exon 2 methylation. METHODS: The methylation of hepaCAM exon 2 and the expression of hepaCAM were determined by methylation-specific restriction PCR assay and RT-PCR in bladder cancer cells (T24, BIU-87) as well as in 55 paired bladder cancer specimens. The methylated bladder cancer cells were treated with 5-Aza- 2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a demethylating agent. MTT was used to detect the proliferation of T24 and BIU-87 cells. RESULTS: The proliferation of T24 and BIU-87 cells was suppressed by treatment with different concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR; the expression of hepaCAM was absent in T24 and BIU-87 cells, and we found that exon 2 of hepaCAM was methylated in the 2 cells. hepaCAM mRNA was re-expressed and the methylation status of hepaCAM exon 2 was reversed after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. The expression of hepaCAM mRNA in bladder cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent tissues. The methylation rate of hepaCAM exon 2 was significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues. The methylation of hepaCAM exon 2 was related to hepaCAM expression in bladder cancer tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of hepaCAM expression plays an important role in the tumorigenesis and development of bladder cancer. DNA methylation may be important for downregulation of hepaCAM expression in bladder cancer.
