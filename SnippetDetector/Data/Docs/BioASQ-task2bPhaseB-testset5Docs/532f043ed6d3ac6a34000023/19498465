<abstract>
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are promising new epi-drugs, but the presence of both class I and class II enzymes in HDAC complexes precludes a detailed elucidation of the individual HDAC functions. By using the class II-specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568, we separated class I- and class II-dependent effects and defined the roles of class II enzymes in muscle differentiation in cultured cells and in vivo. MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D acetylation. In vivo MC1568 shows an apparent tissue-selective HDAC inhibition. In skeletal muscle and heart, MC1568 inhibits the activity of HDAC4 and HDAC5 without affecting HDAC3 activity, thereby leaving MEF2-HDAC complexes in a repressed state. Our results suggest that HDAC class II-selective inhibitors might have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of muscle and heart diseases.

Introduction
rowing evidence supports a therapeutic potential for histone deacetylases (s) against diseases such as cancer (inucci & elicci, 2006), neurodegenerative disorders or cardiac hypertrophy (hang et al, 2002; hang et al, 2004; ega et al, 2004; ejat et al, 2005; ang & regoire, 2005; rivedi et al, 2007). he 18 human s are divided into four subsets: class  (1β€“3,8), class  (4, 5, 7, 9 form the class a, whereas 6, 10 belong to class b), class  that are referred to as sirtuins (1β€“7) and class  ( 11). lass ,  and  s share common features such as the dependence on zinc for their enzymatic activity, whereas class  s are +-dependent. lthough class  s are nuclear and believed to act predominantly at the chromatin level, class  s shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus and target selected physiological programmes. lass a s compete, in a signal-responsive manner, with p300 for direct binding to myocyte enhancer factor 2 (2), inhibiting the expression of 2-responsive genes. 4 and 5 are predominantly expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle and brain, the same tissues that express the highest levels of 2. 2 activates or represses myogenesis, depending on its interactions with s, through the /2 domains, thus revealing a regulating role for chromatin modifiers in muscular gene activation (u et al, 2000a). ene ablation experiments support the organ-specific function of class  s; 5 or 9 knockout leads to cardiac hypertrophy (hang et al, 2004; c. Kinsey & Olson, 2004, 2005) and HDAC4 null mice show skeletal defects possibly linked to altered RUNX2 (runt-related transcription factor 2) action (Vega et al, 2004). HDAC6 inhibition stimulates tubulin acetylation and influences cell motility (Palazzo et al, 2003; Zhang et al, 2003), but the role of HDAC6 in cellular management of misfolded proteins (Kawaguchi et al, 2003) has also been reported. Class II HDACs recruit corepressors and/or protein-modifying enzymes that, in turn, inactivate transcription factors. The diverse HDAC actions provide a strong rationale for analysing their functions by using selective inhibitors. Here we provide a comparative cell-biological analysis of pan (suberoyl anilide hydroxamic acid; SAHA) and class II selective (MC1568) HDAC inhibitors (Mai et al, 2005). We report that MC1568 blocks muscle cell differentiation by a new repressive mechanism. We also show that MC1568 acts in vivo repressing MEF2 function through a non-enzymatic mechanism. These findings are discussed in view of the therapeutic implications of selective HDAC inhibitors.

Results
ancer cells are not affected by  class  inhibition. Although MC1568 (Fig 1A; Mai et al, 2005) blocks the cellular activity of HDAC4 in vitro, no inhibition is seen with MS275, which inhibits class I (1, 2 and, to a lesser extent, 3), with the exception of HDAC8, or with valproic acid (VPA; Fig 1B left). MC1568 was tested using in vitro HDAC assays with HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 recombinant proteins on histone (Fig 1B right, C) and non-histone substrates (Lahm et al, 2007; Fig 1D right). The results show that MC1568 is a specific class II inhibitor. Note that recombinant human HDACs, the purity of which was verified (supplementary Fig 1A online), might still be missing further crucial components or post-translational modifications relevant for their function. Furthermore, the HDAC inhibition was proportional to the incubation time (supplementary Fig 1B online; data not shown). At the cellular level, MC1568 inhibited HDAC6 in both breast (ZR75.1) and haematological (U937) cancer cells, as revealed by hyper-acetylation of Ξ±-tubulin (supplementary Fig 2D,1G online). Although class I inhibitors block cell-cycle progression by inducing p21CIP1/WAF1 and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis (Nebbioso et al, 2005), MC1568 failed to inhibit cell proliferation to any significant extent (supplementary Fig 2Aβ€“C,E,F online and supplementary Fig 3Aβ€“C online). Thus, the anticancer effects of pan-HDAC inhibitors might be related to their class I inhibition. However, synergistic effects owing to simultaneous class I and II inhibition or antiproliferative effects of class II HDAC inhibitors when used at higher concentrations cannot be excluded.MC1568 induces MEF2 repressory complex stabilizationThe observation that class IIa HDACs are active in a ternary complex with HDAC3β€“SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor)β€“NCOR (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1; Fischle et al, 2002) has previously precluded analysis of the individual roles of HDAC3 and class II HDACs; however, MC1568 allowed us to distinguish between the class I and class II effects. MC1568 blocked the induction of myogenin and Ξ±-myosin heavy chain (Ξ±MHC) gene expression 48 h after the addition of differentiation medium (Fig 2A lanes 1β€“3); even when added 24 h after the induction of differentiation, the inhibitor still blocked myogenin (Fig 2A lane 4). MEF2D induction (Lu et al, 2000a) was also repressed. HDAC4 levels were not affected (Fig 2B lane 2, Fig 2C lane 4). Interestingly, analogues of MC1568 (supplementary Fig 4A online and refs therein), reported to be inactive on class II HDACs and clearly inactive on recombinant human HDAC4 (supplementary Fig 4 online), were unable to repress myogenesis as shown by Ξ±MHC gene expression (supplementary Fig 4B online), thus confirming the specificity of the MC1568 effect and the relevance of enzymatic inhibition. Furthermore, MEF2D immunoprecipitation revealed that its acetylation (Fig 2C lanes 1 and 2) was inhibited by MC1568 (Fig 2C lane 4) and the concomitant release of co-precipitated HDAC4 was blocked (Fig 2C lanes 2β€“4; see also Fig 2D). Given that class II HDACs are inhibited in the presence of MC1568 (Fig 1), this deacetylation must be due to the action of HDAC class I. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation experiments corroborated that HDAC3 forms a complex with MEF2D, which is disrupted on differentiation yet stabilized by MC1568 (Fig 2D). Neither HDAC1 nor HDAC2 were found to be associated with MEF2D (data not shown), indicating that MEF2D deacetylation is HDAC3-mediated. Complexes immunoprecipitated with MEF2D retained HDAC activity in the presence of MC1568, whereas co-exposure to VPA abolished this activity (Fig 3A). Thus, HDAC3, present in the MEF2D complex, is responsible for the maintenance of HDAC activity in the presence of MC1568. Furthermore, quantitative PCR chromatin immunoprecipitation (qPCR ChIP) revealed that histone H3 acetylation at the MEF2D target gene myogenin promoter is also inhibited by MC1568 (Fig 3B), consistent with a model in which MEF2 deacetylation and/or stabilization of the HDAC3β€“HDAC4β€“MEF2D complex are a consequence of the treatment with MC1568. Accordingly, MEF2D qPCR ChIP confirmed its presence on myogenin and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoters during differentiation and its absence during MC1568 co-incubation, whereas HDAC3 and HDAC4 were absent in both conditions (Fig 3C and supplementary Fig 5A online). In addition, MyoD recruitment to responsive promoters was altered by MC1568, as well as by its activity on 4REluc and 3xMEF2luc reports (supplementary Fig 5B,C online). Our results reveal that the pharmacological block of class II HDACs unexpectedly results in the deacetylation of MEF2 by HDAC3 and stabilization of the inhibitory HDAC3β€“HDAC4β€“MEF2D complex, thus blocking MEF2 target gene activation.Tissue-selective activity of MC1568 in miceWe tested the HDAC inhibitory potential of MC1568 in CD1 (Crl:CD-1(ICR)) outbred mice. Administration of the 50 mg/kg dose every 2 days for a 10-day period did not result in detectable liver toxicity, weight loss or behavioural abnormalities. Even after a 6-h acute administration of MC1568, tubulin acetylation increased in organs such as the kidney, spleen, muscle and heart. No effects were observed in the stomach, ovary/uterus, lung or brain where tubulin was differently but constantly acetylated (Fig 3D). The observations that the muscle and heart showed different and reciprocal expression of HDAC4 and HDAC5 (Fig 3E), and that in both cases these HDACs formed complexes with HDAC3 and MEF2D (Fig 3E bottom part) suggest that in vivo the MC1568 might act in a similar manner to that in C2C12 cells (Fig 3C). Although immunoprecipitation experiments carried out using HDAC5 reveal a clear dose-dependent HDAC5 inhibition in heart extracts from MC1568-treated mice (Fig 3F), MEF2D immunoprecipitations from identical heart extracts show residual HDAC activity that can be inhibited only by class I HDAC inhibitors, thus revealing that in vivo the MEF2D complex also retains class I HDAC-dependent deacetylase activity in the presence of MC1568. Note that in this respect the myogenin expression levels are altered by MC1568 administration in a dose-dependent manner in vivo (supplementary Fig 4C online), thus strongly suggesting a mechanism for (de)regulation of myogenesis for MC1568.

Discussion
e have shown that 1568 (ai et al, 2005; utler & ozikowski, 2008; toh et al, 2008) acts at three distinct levels to interfere with myogenic signalling (ig 4). irst, it blocks the class   enzymatic activity, concomitantly stabilizing the interaction of 2 with the 4β€“β€“3 complex (ig 2,), without altering 4 acetylation levels (supplementary ig 6 online). his sustains muscle-specific gene suppression. econd, the stabilization of the 4β€“2 complex indirectly stabilizes the association of 3 with 2 (ig 2 lanes 3 and 9), thereby providing an enzymatically active  (ig 3). ur finding is fully compatible with the observation that the  catalytic domain mediates the repression activity of the carboxy-terminal regions of class  s (u et al, 2000b), whereas the amino-terminal extensions seem to repress transcription by recruiting class  s and the corepressor -terminal binding protein (hang et al, 2001). n support of this idea, the -terminal region of class  s (in particular 4) has been reported to be responsible for 2 repression in a deacetylase-independent manner (omonte et al, 2004). hat inhibition of class   enzymatic activity leads to 2 repression reveals that 4 absence (hen et al, 2006; otthoff et al, 2007) can have the opposite effect of blocking its enzymatic activity. hird, inhibition of 4 during differentiation does not block 2 deacetylation (ig 2). ndeed, 4 might not function as a 2 deacetylase (hao et al, 2005). 3, present in the complex, is responsible for 2 deacetylation, as its activity is not blocked by 1568. hat 3 is necessary for cardiac energy metabolism has recently been confirmed in a study on a conditional 3-null allele (ontgomery et al, 2008). he inability to recruit co-activators and the sustained activity of class  s are likely to account for the low histone 3 acetylation on 2 target chromatin (ig 3). inally, 1568 stabilization of 4β€“2 binding might account for the absence of 2 (ig 3) and yo. D (supplementary Fig 5B online) on responsive promoters. The fact that the activatory role of MyoD on myogenesis measured in transfection on two responsive reporters is impaired by MC1568 (supplementary Fig 5C online) strongly supports our hypothesis, not excluding the possibility that additional mechanisms might still occur. In vivo MC1568 showed organ-selective effects. The fact that MC1568 showed inhibitory action on HDAC5 in vitro and in vivo (Fig 1, 3), and the data from the mice heart and skeletal muscles confirm the mechanism described in C2C12 cells (Fig 3; supplementary Fig 4C,5 online). Recent studies have pointed to the possible use of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy (Antos et al, 2003; McKinsey & Olson, 2005; Trivedi et al, 2007). Interestingly, class II HDACs function as signal-responsive repressors of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, presumably through their ability to block MEF2 target genes (Zhang et al, 2002). Therefore, class II-specific HDAC inhibitors, which inhibit HDAC activity and block MEF2-mediated transactivation, might represent new tools. The challenge will be to ensure that sufficient MEF2 activity is maintained for homoeostatic control in the heart, as MEF2 ablation leads to cardiomyopathy and an increased risk of myocardial infarction in humans (Naya et al, 2002; Wang et al, 2003). Our results show new mechanisms by which HDAC class II inhibition blocks myogenesis and demonstrate that HDAC class II inhibition is fundamentally different from the inhibition of HDAC expression. Future work will reveal the potential of class II inhibitors in the treatment of cardiac diseases.
