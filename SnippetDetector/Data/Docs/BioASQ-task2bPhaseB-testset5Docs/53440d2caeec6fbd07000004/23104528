INTRODUCTION: Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the genome and potentially involved in the progress of malignant tumours. The role of lncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (MALAT-1) in human laryngeal squamous cell cancer (LSCC) is not well understood. METHODS: The expression level of MALAT-1 in 72 LSCC and the corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues was examined using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between the expression of MALAT-1 and clinicopathologic factors was determined. A methylthiazol tetrazolium assay was used to detect the proliferation of LSCC cells after MALAT-1 short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) transfection in vitro. The growth of mice xenografts was observed after an intra-tumoral injection of MALAT-1 short interfering ribonucleic acids. Furthermore, apoptosis in the xenografts was determined by terminal uridine nick end labelling stain and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: The level of MALAT-1 in LSCC was significantly higher than that in the corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. Patients with a poor histological grade or an advanced clinical stage have a higher expression of MALAT-1. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited after MALAT-1 siRNA transfection in vitro. The growth of xenografts was significantly suppressed by a repeated injection of a MALAT-1 siRNA lentivirus. Moreover, the apoptosis cells were increased in MALAT-1 siRNA lentivirus-treated LSCC xenografts than the control. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest an important role for MALAT-1 in the progress of LSCC and the potential application of MALAT-1 in laryngeal squamous cell cancer therapy.
