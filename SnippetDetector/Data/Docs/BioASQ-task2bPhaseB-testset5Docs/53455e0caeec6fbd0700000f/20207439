BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver resection includes temporal vascular inflow occlusion resulting in ischemia/reperfusion injury in the remnant liver. Here, we developed a rat model of selective lobe occlusion to isolate reperfusion stress from ischemia and to analyze its effect on liver regeneration. METHODS: Left lateral and median lobes of liver were either mobilized or subjected twice for 10min to ischemia followed by 5min reperfusion prior to resection while the regenerative lobes were only subjected to reperfusion. RESULTS: Although intermittent reperfusion stress induced higher levels of serum transaminases, analysis of cell cycle regulators revealed accelerated regenerative response compared to standard partial hepatectomy. The G0/G1 transition occurred before tissue resection, as evidenced by c-fos, junB, and IL-6 induction. Following hepatectomy, Cyclin D1 up-regulation, G1/S transition, and cell division occurred earlier than normal. Unexpectedly, liver mobilization, a component of the clamping procedure, also resulted in earlier G1/S transition. The shortened G1-phase was driven by the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase pathway and was associated with an oxidative stress response as evidenced by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. CONCLUSION: Intermittent selective clamping of lobes to be resected induced reperfusion stress on remnant liver that was beneficial for liver regeneration, suggesting this procedure could be applied in clinical practice.
