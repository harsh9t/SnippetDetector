CpG dinucleotides provide hotspots for transitional mutations in a variety of genes, some leading to genetic diseases in humans. Although this phenomenon is attributed to cytosine methylation at such sites, direct and specific observations of CpG methylation at the sites of recurrent mutations are lacking. We have used a bisulfite genomic sequencing method to analyze DNA methylation within three representative exons from the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, well recognized for its high frequency of spontaneous mutations. We observed that the cytosine methylation within NF1 exons 28, 29, and 31 is restricted to CpG dinucleotides, including the CpG dinucleotide present at the site of the recurrent NF1 mutation (C5839T; also referred to as R1947X). At several sites, clone-specific methylation differences were also observed. Our results provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that methylatable CpGs in the NF1 gene contribute to spontaneous germline mutations associated with this gene, by showing that DNA methylation does occur at all CpGs contained within these representative NF1 exons. As well, the DNA methylation seen at the common mutation site in exon 31 may explain why this site is frequently mutated. Methylation-dependent mutagenesis may also provide a basis for some somatic (second hit) mutations which disable the normal allele and result in the development of NF1 associated symptoms.
