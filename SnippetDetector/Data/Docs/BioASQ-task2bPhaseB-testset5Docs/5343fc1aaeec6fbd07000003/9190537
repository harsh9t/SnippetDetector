Two forms of neurofibromatosis, type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) are connected with genes localized on chromosomes 17 and 22, respectively. The genes that are inactivated in neurofibromatosis code for the proteins neurofibromine and merline, respectively. Since inactivation leads to neoplasia, they are called tumour suppressor genes. Neurofibromine shows resemblances to proteins that serve to inactivate oncogenes. Merline has a relationship with proteins that connect the cytoskeleton and the cell membrane. The precise function of the proteins is still unknown. The NF1 gene is characterized by extraordinarily high sensitivity to mutation; half the NF1 patients have not inherited the disease. In the familial form of neurofibromatosis, a mutated gene is inherited and the normal allele in the tumour is inactivated, making tumour growth possible. In the sporadic form of neurofibromatosis, both normal alleles are inactivated locally in the tissue so that a tumour develops in that place.
