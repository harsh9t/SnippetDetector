Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas and occasionally spiradenomas. The disease gene was mapped to 16q12-13, and mutations in the CYLD gene were identified in families with BSS. In the present report, we describe a large consanguineous Chinese family with BSS showing an intra-family phenotypic variability. Clinically, some affected individuals only revealed discrete small skin-coloured tumors whereas the proband showed an expansion of multiple large tumors on the back of nose and numerous dome-shaped papules on her scalp. Histologically, both trichoepitheliomas and cylindromas were found in the affected individuals. By sequence analysis, we identified a recurrent mutation 2272C>T (R758X) of the CYLD gene in the affected individuals of this family, which was previously identified in other ethnic families with familial cylindromatosis. Our result provided additional information for phenotype-genotype correlation in BSS.
