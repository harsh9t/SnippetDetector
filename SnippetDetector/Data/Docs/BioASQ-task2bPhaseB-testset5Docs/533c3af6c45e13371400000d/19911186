Multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT, OMIM 601606) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease. It is characterized by numerous skin-colored papules on the central face. Pathogenic mutations in the CYLD gene have been identified. In this report, we identified a novel mutation of CYLD gene in a Chinese family with MFT. It is a novel heterozygous nucleotide G-->A transition at position 2,317 in exon 17 of the CYLD gene. Our study expands the database on the CYLD gene mutations in MFT.
