The pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) gene is activated in a subset of pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland by gene fusion. Germ‑line mutation in cylindromatosis (CYLD), a tumor suppressor gene, causes familial cylindromatosis and Brook‑Spiegler syndrome. In the present study, aberrations in PLAG1 and CYLD were investigated in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the salivary gland. Reverse‑transcription PCR and PCR direct sequencing were performed to detect gene fusion of PLAG1 and mutation of CYLD in 34 ACC tissues. No PLAG1 fusion was detected in ACC. However, silent mutation of CYLD was detected in 2 cases of ACC, but no missense mutation was detected in ACC. These results suggest that PLAG1 and CYLD do not play a role in ACC tumorigenesis.
