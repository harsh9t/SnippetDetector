The authors report a 64-year-old female with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome who presented with multiple cutaneous nodules and tumors mostly involving the scalp. Histopathological examination of one of the lesions located in a periauricular area revealed a typical cylindroma. In some neoplastic nodules ductal differentiation and occasional bilayered glands composed of the dark abluminal basal/myoepithelial cells and luminal mucinous cells might be recognized. Apocrine secretion was focally noted. Molecular biologic study of the CYLD gene performed from the peripheral blood identified a novel splice site c.2041+1 G>T mutation. This new germline mutation in the CYLD gene of a Slovak patient with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome extends the catalogue of known CYLD germline mutations in this condition.
