Survival of the malignant Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is dependent on constitutive activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor. The deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and known to function as a tumor suppressor. To determine whether CYLD mutations play a role in cHL pathogenesis, we sequenced the gene in cHL cell lines and microdissected HRS cells obtained from lymph-node biopsies. A biallelic inactivation by mutations was found in the cHL cell-line KM-H2. However, the other seven cHL cell lines analyzed and HRS cells of 10 primary cHL cases did not show any mutations. By interphase cytogenetics, a (sub)clonal biallelic CYLD deletion was observed by interphase cytogenetics in 1 of 29 primary cHL, whereas signal patterns indicating decreased CYLD copy numbers were observed in a total of 10 of 29 primary cases. Our results suggest that biallelic CYLD mutations are rarely involved in cHL pathogenesis. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that KM-H2 cells, besides the CYLD mutations, also carry inactivating mutations in the genes of two other NF-kappaB inhibitors, that is, NFKBIA and TNFAIP3, exemplifying that multiple lesions in regulators of this signaling pathway can likely cooperatively contribute to the strong NF-kappaB activity of these cells.
