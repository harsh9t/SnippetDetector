The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is an important translation initiation factor that binds to the polyadenylated 3' end of mRNA. We have previously shown that PABP2 interacts with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and VPg-Pro of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) within virus-induced vesicles. At least eight PABP isoforms are produced in Arabidopsis thaliana, three of which (PABP2, PABP4 and PABP8) are highly and broadly expressed and probably constitute the bulk of PABP required for cellular functions. Upon TuMV infection, an increase in protein and mRNA expression from PAB2, PAB4 and PAB8 genes was recorded. In vitro binding assays revealed that RdRp and the viral genome-linked protein (VPg-Pro) interact preferentially with PABP2 but are also capable of interaction with one or both of the other class II PABPs (i.e. PABP4 and PABP8). To assess whether PABP is required for potyvirus replication, A. thaliana single and double pab knockouts were isolated and inoculated with TuMV. All lines showed susceptibility to TuMV. However, when precise monitoring of viral RNA accumulation was performed, it was found to be reduced by 2.2- and 3.5-fold in pab2 pab4 and pab2 pab8 mutants, respectively, when compared with wild-type plants. PABP levels were most significantly reduced in the membrane-associated fraction in both of these mutants. TuMV mRNA levels thus correlated with cellular PABP concentrations in these A. thaliana knockout lines. These data provide further support for a role of PABP in potyvirus replication.
