Spermiogenesis is a postmeiotic process that drives development of round spermatids into fully elongated spermatozoa. Spermatid elongation is largely controlled post-transcriptionally after global silencing of mRNA synthesis from the haploid genome. Here, rats that differentially express EGFP from a lentiviral transgene during early and late steps of spermiogenesis were used to flow sort fractions of round and elongating spermatids. Mass-spectral analysis of 2D gel protein spots enriched >3-fold in each fraction revealed a heterogeneous RNA binding proteome (hnRNPA2/b1, hnRNPA3, hnRPDL, hnRNPK, hnRNPL, hnRNPM, PABPC1, PABPC4, PCBP1, PCBP3, PTBP2, PSIP1, RGSL1, RUVBL2, SARNP2, TDRD6, TDRD7) abundantly expressed in round spermatids prior to their elongation. Notably, each protein within this ontology cluster regulates alternative splicing, sub-cellular transport, degradation and/or translational repression of mRNAs. In contrast, elongating spermatid fractions were enriched with glycolytic enzymes, redox enzymes and protein synthesis factors. Retrogene-encoded proteins were over-represented among the most abundant elongating spermatid factors identified. Consistent with these biochemical activities, plus corresponding histological profiles, the identified RNA processing factors are predicted to collectively drive post-transcriptional expression of an alternative exome that fuels finishing steps of sperm maturation and fitness.
