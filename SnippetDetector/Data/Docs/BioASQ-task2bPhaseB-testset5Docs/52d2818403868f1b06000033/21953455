DNA mismatch repair (MMR) greatly contributes to genome integrity via the correction of mismatched bases that are mainly generated by replication errors. Postreplicative MMR excises a relatively long tract of error-containing single-stranded DNA. MutL is a widely conserved nicking endonuclease that directs the excision reaction to the error-containing strand of the duplex by specifically nicking the daughter strand. Because MutL apparently exhibits nonspecific nicking endonuclease activity in vitro, the regulatory mechanism of MutL has been argued. Recent studies suggest ATP-dependent conformational and functional changes of MutL, indicating that the regulatory mechanism involves the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle. In this study, we investigated the effect of ATP binding on the structure of MutL. First, a cross-linking experiment confirmed that the N-terminal ATPase domain physically interacts with the C-terminal endonuclease domain. Next, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry clarified that the binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain induces local structural changes at the catalytic sites of MutL C-terminal domain. Finally, on the basis of the results of the hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiment, we successfully identified novel regions essential for the endonuclease activity of MutL. The results clearly show that ATP modulates the nicking endonuclease activity of MutL via structural rearrangements of the catalytic site. In addition, several Lynch syndrome-related mutations in human MutL homolog are located in the position corresponding to the newly identified catalytic region. Our data contribute toward understanding the relationship between mutations in MutL homolog and human disease.
