<abstract>
Chromosomes with multiple DNA replication origins are a hallmark of Eukaryotes and some Archaea. All eukaryal nuclear replication origins are defined by the origin recognition complex (ORC) that recruits the replicative helicase MCM(2-7) via Cdc6 and Cdt1. We find that the three origins in the single chromosome of the archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus are specified by distinct initiation factors. While two origins are dependent on archaeal homologs of eukaryal Orc1 and Cdc6, the third origin is instead reliant on an archaeal Cdt1 homolog. We exploit the nonessential nature of the orc1-1 gene to investigate the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in initiator function in vivo and in vitro. We find that the ATP-bound form of Orc1-1 is proficient for replication and implicates hydrolysis of ATP in downregulation of origin activity. Finally, we reveal that ATP and DNA binding by Orc1-1 remodels the protein's structure rather than that of the DNA template.

Introduction
everal archaeal species have multiple origins of replication per chromosome (undgren et. Β al., 2004; Norais etΒ al., 2007; Robinson and Bell, 2007; Robinson etΒ al., 2004, 2007). For example, chromosomes of species in the genus Sulfolobus are replicated from three origins (Lundgren etΒ al., 2004; Robinson etΒ al., 2004, 2007). All three origins fire once per cell cycle in all cells (Duggin etΒ al., 2008a). Two of the origins, oriC1 and oriC2, lie adjacent to the genes for the candidate initiator proteins Orc1-1 and Orc1-3, respectively (She etΒ al., 2001). Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 share 35% amino acid sequence identity and are related to both eukaryotic Orc1 and Cdc6 (Bell and Dutta, 2002; Robinson and Bell, 2007). There is additionally a third Orc1/Cdc6 protein in Sulfolobus, Orc1-2, but it is not encoded adjacent to an origin. The third origin, oriC3, lies beside the gene for a crenarchaeal-specific protein, WhiP. WhiP is predicted to have a tandem winged-helix structure reminiscent of bacterial plasmid Rep proteins and has sequence similarity to the eukaryal replication factor Cdt1 (Robinson and Bell, 2007). Biochemical DNA footprinting studies have revealed that complex interactions among the Sulfolobus solfataricus Orc1/Cdc6 proteins, WhiP, and the replication origins are possible inΒ vitro (Robinson and Bell, 2007; Robinson etΒ al., 2004, 2007). More specifically, Orc1-1, Orc1-2, and WhiP bind to all three origins, and Orc1-3 binds to oriC2 and oriC3. However, the precise requirements for origin function either inΒ vivo or inΒ vitro remain unknown. The Orc1 proteins are AAA+ proteins that undergo a single-turnover hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, but the functional consequences of ATP binding and hydrolysis are not yet known (Singleton etΒ al., 2004). In the current work, we address these fundamental issues. First, we determine the initiator protein requirements for origin function inΒ vivo in the genetically tractable strain Sulfolobus islandicus (Sis) (Guo etΒ al., 2011; Zhang etΒ al., 2010). We find that none of the Orc1/Cdc6 genes are essential for cell viability. Furthermore, we reveal that while oriC1 requires the orc1-1 gene product for function, oriC2 is dependent on Orc1-3. Finally, we find that oriC3 functions independently of all three Orc1/Cdc6 proteins but requires the Cdt1-related protein WhiP.
Next, we exploit the nonessential nature of Orc1-1 to express mutant forms of the protein and assay their phenotype with respect to oriC1 firing inΒ vivo. Our data reveal that expression of a Walker B mutant form of the protein that can bind but not hydrolyze ATP leads to an overreplication phenotype, with elevated levels of initiation at oriC1. We further observe an enhanced ability of the Walker B mutant protein to recruit MCM to origin DNA inΒ vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that the ATP-bound form of the protein, when bound to DNA, does not impinge on the geometry of the DNA but remodels its own conformation.

Results
one of the orc1/cdc6 enes re ssential for iability. To address the roles of the individual Orc1/Cdc6 paralogs, we generated mutant S.Β islandicus cell lines in which the relevant genes were deleted (FigureΒ 1A). The resultant strains were viable and showed growth and flow-cytometry profiles that were essentially indistinguishable from the wild-type (WT) strain (Figures 1B and C). We assayed origin activity using two-dimensional (2D) neutral-neutral agarose gel electrophoresis. As can be seen in FigureΒ 1D, deletion of orc1-1 abrogates firing of oriC1 but does not affect initiation at oriC2 or oriC3. Deletion of orc1-2 does not affect firing at any of the three origins, but deletion of orc1-3 abolishes oriC2 activity.Next, we constructed double mutants lacking pairs of Orc1/Cdc6 proteins (FigureΒ 2A). All three possible double mutants were generated, but attempts to generate a triple mutant were unsuccessful. The growth rates of all three double mutants were lower than WT or single mutants, and flow cytometry suggested an elevated S phase population of cells in the Ξ”orc1-2/Ξ”orc1-3 and Ξ”orc1-1/Ξ”orc1-3 strains (Figures 2B and 2C). The strain lacking both Orc1-2 and Orc1-3 phenocopies the single orc1-3 deletion, with no firing detectable at oriC2 but retaining oriC1 and oriC3 activity (FigureΒ 2D). Similarly, as observed for deletion of orc1-1 alone, deletion of both orc1-1 and orc1-2 inactivated oriC1, but oriC2 and oriC3 still fired. (FigureΒ 2D). Significantly, the Ξ”orc1-1/Ξ”orc1-3 double mutant only showed replication initiation at oriC3; no replication initiation activity was detected at either oriC1 or oriC2 in this strain (FigureΒ 2D).To exclude the possibility that hitherto-undetected cryptic origins might have been activated in the mutant backgrounds, we determined the genome-wide replication profile of the WT and Ξ”orc1-1/Ξ”orc1-3 mutant strains by marker frequency analysis (MFA) in conjunction with next-generation sequencing. In agreement with previous studies, three peaks can be observed in the WT strain, corresponding to origin activity at oriC1, oriC2, and oriC3 (FigureΒ 2E). As previously seen, the peak at oriC2 is of lower amplitude due to the broader temporal window of firing of this origin compared to the other two. Significantly, only a single peak is observed in the Ξ”orc1-1/Ξ”orc1-3 mutant strain, revealing that the chromosome of this strain is replicated from a single origin, oriC3 (FigureΒ 2F). There is a modest shoulder on the slope of the peak coincident with the position of oriC1, but potential firing here is clearly at a very low level, undetectable by 2D gel analyses and independent of Orc1-1 or Orc1-3. We further note that the trough corresponding to replication termination events is repositioned in this strain to 180Β° around the chromosome from oriC3.The whiP Gene Is Required for oriC3 FunctionInterestingly, none of the individual or double Orc1/Cdc6 gene deletions impinged upon firing of oriC3. We therefore speculated that this origin could be functioning independently of Orc1/Cdc6 paralogs. Notably, the Cdt1-related protein WhiP is encoded adjacent to oriC3 (Robinson and Bell, 2007). Further, we have previously shown that this protein binds to sequence motifs in the oriC3 region, immediately downstream of the whiP gene (Robinson and Bell, 2007). We therefore generated a strain lacking WhiP by introducing tandem stop codons following the start codon of the open reading frame (ORF). The absence of WhiP in the resultant line was confirmed by western blotting (FigureΒ 3A). Cell growth and flow cytometry revealed that the mutant cells grew slower than either WT cells or any of the single orc1 deletion mutants and with a 2-fold increase in sub-1C signal in the flow cytometry (Figures 3B and 3C). Significantly, loss of the WhiP protein correlated with loss of firing at oriC3 but had no effect on initiation at oriC1 and oriC2, as adjudged both by 2D neutral-neutral agarose gel electrophoresis analysis and MFA (Figures 3D and 3E). Thus, while oriC3 is independent of individual and pairwise combinations of Orc1/Cdc6 proteins (Figures 1 and 2), WhiP is required for replication initiation at this origin (Figures 3D and 3E).Binding of Initiators to Origins InΒ VivoTo address origin occupancy by the initiator proteins inΒ vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using antisera generated against Orc1-1, Orc1-2, and Orc1-3 and WhiP. In agreement with the lack of requirement for Orc1-2 for firing of any origin, we did not detect binding of Orc1-2 to any of the origins. Also in good agreement with the genetic analyses, we find that oriC1 is bound by Orc1-1, oriC2 shows strongest association with Orc1-3, and while no association of any Orc1/Cdc6 protein is observed at oriC3, the WhiP protein is specifically localized at this origin (Figures 4Aβ€“4D).Archaea are believed to undergo coupled transcription and translation (French etΒ al., 2007). We were, therefore, concerned that the ability to chromatin immunoprecipitate DNA corresponding to the origins located adjacent to the relevant initiatorΒ protein gene could reflect crosslinking of nascent polypeptides to the initiator ORF rather than to the origin itself. We therefore performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of the three Orc1/Cdc6 proteins and WhiP to give a higher-resolution analysis of the proteinsβ€™ DNA occupancy. As can be seen in Figures 4Eβ€“4G and FigureΒ S1, the relevant proteins showed strong association with the origin loci. Notably, the WhiP ChIP recovers most DNA at internal positions within the WhiP ORF. In addition, a broad but shallow peak was observed over the previously described inΒ vitro binding sites (Robinson and Bell, 2007). These lie at the boundaries of the downstream intergenic region, to which initiation at oriC3 has been mapped (Robinson etΒ al., 2007). The whiP ORF contains conserved AT-rich sequence repeats (FigureΒ S1) and footprinting studies reveal that the protein binds to these with nanomolar affinity. We reiterate that the whiP mutation that we employed to inactivate the gene for the genetic studies was by introduction of stop codons at the start of the ORF, rather than by deletion of the ORF (and thus its internal repeats).In agreement with the 2D gel analyses, we detect Orc1-3 binding at oriC2 but do not observe significant binding of Orc1-1 to this locus. This was surprising to us because previous ChIP analyses and biochemical and structural studies of the closely related organism, Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso), had demonstrated that both Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 bind to oriC2 in that species (Dueber etΒ al., 2007, 2011; Robinson etΒ al., 2004). However, examination of the sequence of S.Β islandicus oriC2 reveals that one of the characterized mini origin recognition box (mORB) Orc1-1 binding sites has several base substitutions in conserved positions in the binding site when compared with S.Β solfataricus oriC2 (FigureΒ S2). Additionally, the second mORB element has substitutions immediately adjacent to the core consensus motif. We therefore tested the S.Β islandicus Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 proteinsβ€™ DNA binding preferences inΒ vitro. Remarkably, but in agreement with the ChIP analyses, Sis Orc1-1 binds with at least 10-fold lower affinity than Sso Orc1-1 to either of the mORB-like elements in Sis oriC2. Notably, Sis Orc1-1 has lower affinity for Sso oriC2 than has Sso Orc1-1. As expected from the ChIP studies, Orc1-3 binds to Sis oriC2-derived sequences (FigureΒ S2). Thus, both origin sequence and initiator protein sequence define the differential binding of Orc1-1 to oriC2 between S.Β solfataricus and S.Β islandicus. Remarkably, even between two closely related species within the Sulfolobus genus, we can observe variation within initiator protein specificity and function.Nucleotide Binding and Orc1-1 Function at oriC1 InΒ VivoWe wished to exploit the nonessential nature of Orc1-1 to perform structure-function analyses in living cells. We therefore sought to complement the chromosomal Orc1-1 deletion with a plasmid-encoded copy. Initially, we expressed the gene from its own promoter on a low-copy-number plasmid. We could detect Orc1-1 protein by western blotting (FigureΒ 5A), and the protein localized to oriC1 as adjudged by ChIP experiments (FigureΒ 6B). However, we were unable to detect any replication initiation at oriC1 by neutral-neutral 2D agarose gel electrophoresis (FigureΒ 5B). We therefore expressed Orc1-1 from a strong arabinose-inducible promoter (Albers etΒ al., 2006). Either basal or induced expression of the protein from the araS promoter led to initiation at oriC1 as detected by 2D gels (FigureΒ 5B). Indeed, the intensity of the β€�bubbleβ€� arc initiation structure was reproducibly stronger than the rather weak arc observed in WT cells (FigureΒ 5B). This enhanced intensity prompted us to evaluate the DNA content of these cells. Interestingly, cells that express the Orc1-1 protein from the arabinose promoter in either basal or induced conditions show an aberrant flow-cytometry profile with an elevated population of cells, with between 1C and 2C and greater than 2C genome contents (FigureΒ 5C). Furthermore, fluorescence microcopy of these cells reveals altered cell morphologies, with 14% of cells extruding vesicle-like structures (FigureΒ 5D).Transcription of the orc1-1 gene in S.Β acidocaldarius and S.Β solfataricus is known to be regulated following perturbation of the cell cycle and after a number of cellular stresses (FrΓ¶ls etΒ al., 2007; GΓ¶tz etΒ al., 2007; Lundgren and Bernander, 2007; Ortmann etΒ al., 2008). We therefore wished to determine the profile of expression of this and the other initiator protein genes during a minimally perturbed cell cycle. We employed our previously described β€�Baby machineβ€� method for synchronizing cells (Duggin etΒ al., 2008a). For these studies, we utilized S.Β acidocaldarius cells because they have given the best synchrony in these experiments. We observe a striking cyclic pattern of transcript levels for orc1-1, orc1-3, and whip (FigureΒ 5E), although we have previously demonstrated that Orc1/Cdc6 protein levels remain constant across the cell cycle (Duggin etΒ al., 2008a). Nevertheless, all three transcripts show lowest levels in S phase and peak in or just before G1 phase. Interestingly, orc1-3 mRNA levels peak slightly later than orc1-1, correlating with the broader temporal window of oriC2 firing (Duggin etΒ al., 2008a).The Orc1/Cdc6 proteins possess a AAA+ domain and previous work has shown that this catalyzes a single turnover ATP hydrolysis event, resulting in stable binding of ADP (Singleton etΒ al., 2004). Indeed, Orc1/Cdc6s from a range of archaeal species, when purified as recombinant proteins from bacteria, are isolated exclusively in the ADP-bound form. By analogy with bacterial DnaA, we assumed that the ATP-bound form of Orc1/Cdc6 proteins is the active form (see also below) (Kaguni, 2011; Mott and Berger, 2007). We therefore speculated that the cell-cycle-dependent wave of orc1-1 transcription would result in transiently increased levels of Orc1-1β‹…ATP and that this could create a permissive window for replication initiation. Expressing Orc1-1 constitutively during the cell cycle from the arabinose promoter would result in temporally ectopic Orc1-1β‹…ATP and could thus account for the overreplication phenotype observed. To test this, we created mutant derivatives of Orc1-1 with alterations in the Walker A and Walker B motifs. The Walker A K69A is anticipated to be unable to bind ATP and the Walker B E147A mutant should bind but fail to hydrolyze ATP. These predicted properties were confirmed using purified recombinant proteins (FigureΒ S3). To exclude the possibility of compounding effects due to overexpression, the proteins were then expressed from a plasmid using the native orc1-1 promoter in the Ξ”orc1-1 strain (FigureΒ 6A). Despite being expressed and binding to oriC1 as detected by ChIP, the Walker A mutant failed to support detectable initiation at oriC1 (Figures 6Aβ€“6C). In contrast, the Walker B mutant shows a bubble arc of greater intensity than seen in WT cells (FigureΒ 6C). Furthermore, this strain shows an aberrant flow cytometry profile, with 22% of the population with greater than 2C genome content (FigureΒ 6D). Additionally, microscopy reveals the presence of large cells with elevated DNA content; 13% of Orc1-1 E147A-expressing cells are greater than 1.5Β ΞΌm in diameter, compared with less than 1% of WT (Figures 6E and 6F). Interestingly, microscopy of the population expressing the Orc1-1 Walker A mutant also shows aberrant large cells (3.8%); however, in agreement with the flow-cytometry profiles, there is not a discernable population of cells with elevated DNA content (as adjudged by DAPI staining). Taken together, our data therefore indicate that the ATP-bound form of Orc1-1 is proficient for origin firing and, furthermore, implicates the hydrolysis of ATP in regulating origin activity.Biochemical Consequences of ATP Binding by Orc1-1To investigate the molecular basis of the distinct properties of the proteins, we first performed gel-filtration analyses. These revealed an increase in retention time of the E147A protein compared to WT, suggestive of a conformational alteration (FigureΒ 7A). Next, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) with the WT and E147A proteins (FigureΒ 7B; FigureΒ S3). The AUC revealed that the WT protein migrated in two populations, both corresponding to monomer with distinct conformations. More specifically, 8.3% of the population had a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8Β s and frictional ratio of 1.37, revealing a more extended configuration than the majority of the protein that resolved in a peak at 3.7Β s with a frictional ratio of 1.07 and thus was more globular. Interestingly, very different behavior was observed with E147A. Although 65% of the E147A proteinΒ behaved as globular monomer (frictional ratio of 1.03), thereΒ was no peak corresponding to the extended monomer configuration. However, E147A generated a peak with a mass compatible with the formation of a dimer. Furthermore, the sedimentation coefficient and frictional ratio of the monomeric form of the E147A protein were lower than those of the majority WT species, indicating that it adopted a distinct conformation.Structural studies have revealed that the ADP-bound forms of Orc1/Cdc6 proteins make bidentate interactions with DNA, binding via the C-terminal wH domain and the initiator-specific motif (ISM) in the AAA+ domain. To date, there is no structure available of the ATP-bound form of Orc1/Cdc6 on DNA. However, Wigley and colleagues were successful in denaturing Orc1-2 from Aeropyrum pernix (Ape), removing ADP and refolding in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ADP-NP, prior to crystallization and structure determination (Singleton etΒ al., 2004). The resultant structure revealed a significant alteration in the relative positioning of the wH and AAA+ domain compared to the various conformations adopted by the ADP-bound form (Singleton etΒ al., 2004). Ape Orc1-2 has only 22% sequence identity to S.Β islandicus Orc1-1 and belongs to a distinct clade of Orc1/Cdc6s; nevertheless, our AUC and gel filtration data suggest that the identity of the nucleotide bound by Orc1-1 also modulates the conformation of this protein in solution.Superimposition of the ADP-NP-bound Orc1-2 structure onto the Orc1-1β‹…ADPβ€“DNA structure, aligning via the principal DNA-binding wH domain, suggests three possible consequences of ATP binding (FigureΒ S4). First, the ISM could disengage from the DNA, conceivably allowing the AAA+ domain to be accessible for interaction with another protomer or client protein; second, both wH and ISM could remain engaged with DNA with consequent remodeling of the intervening duplex DNA; third, both domains remain engaged with DNA and the protein undergoes an internal conformational alteration without modulating DNA structure. To test for the first two scenarios, we performed methidium propyl EDTA footprinting with the WT and E147A proteins on an isolated DNA binding site, the ORB2 element. This technique allows clear resolution of the DNA sequences contacted by wH and ISM. As can be seen from FigureΒ 7C, no discernable difference is seen between the protection patterns mediated by the two proteins, indicating no significant disengagement from, or remodeling of, the DNA binding site. Similarly, there was no discernable difference in the protection pattern upon DNaseI digestion. The same result was observed with ORB1 and ORB3 DNA (data not shown). Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis with full-length origin DNA fragments (FigureΒ 7D) reveals no significant changes in the affinity for DNA or pattern of shifted complexes generated by either the Orc1-1β‹…ADP or the Orc1-1 E147Aβ‹…ATP forms of the protein. Additionally, we could not detect melting of origin DNA, by either potassium permanganate or nuclease P1 sensitivity, by either protein in the presence or absence of nucleotide (data not shown). In light of our AUC and gel filtration data revealing altered conformations of the monomeric protein, we therefore speculated that the principal effect of ATP binding was on the conformation of the protein itself rather than on that of the DNA. To investigate this further, we subjected WT and Walker B mutant Orc1-1 to limited proteolysis with trypsin in the presence and absence of saturating levels of ORB2 DNA. Under both conditions, we observe reduced levels of a β�Ό19Β kDa species with the Walker B mutant form. In the presence of DNA, the digest patterns of both forms of the protein are altered, with a novel 23Β kDa species appearing (FigureΒ 7E). This species was also more abundant with the WT protein. We recovered theΒ gel bands, digested them with chymotrypsin, and subjected the resultant peptides to mass spectrometry (FigureΒ 7F). The upper band yielded two peptides that corresponded to the product of trypsin digestion at R193 and chymotrypsin digestion at Y208 or F185. This is in good agreement with the apparent sizeΒ of the species of β�Ό23Β kDa (trypsin cleavage at R193 wouldΒ generate a C-terminal fragment of 22.8Β kDa and a N-terminal fragment of 22.5Β kDa). The β�Ό19Β kDa band also yielded a peptide derived from trypsin cleavage at R193 and chymotrypsin at F185. Thus, the ATP-bound form of Orc1-1, both in DNA-bound and unbound form, displays altered sensitivity of R193 to trypsin digestion. Significantly, R193 corresponds to the arginine finger of the proteinβ€™s AAA+ site. Thus, in the absence of any observable alterations to the affinity, geometry, or stoichiometry of the protein-DNA interaction between Orc1-1 and DNA, we propose that the differential sensitivity to trypsin reflects a conformational alteration of the ATP-bound form of the protein on DNA that renders it permissive to recruitment of the MCM helicase.Finally, we established an inΒ vitro assay for MCM recruitment to oriC1. In this assay, we immobilized origin or nonorigin DNA on paramagnetic beads, preincubated with WT (ADP-bound) or E147A Orc1-1 in the presence or absence of supplemental ATP and then added cell extract prepared from logarithmically growing S.Β islandicus cells. Following incubation at 50Β°C and washing, beads were recovered and bound proteins eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer prior to western blotting. As can be seen in FigureΒ 7G, neither extract alone nor extract supplemented with WT (ADP-bound) Orc1-1 supports significant MCM recruitment in the absence of ATP. Extract with additional ATP supports recruitment, but interestingly this recruitment is lost by the addition of 1Β ΞΌM WT Orc1-1β‹…ADP, presumably as a consequence of competition with endogenous Orc1-1 for the 200 pM template. Importantly, however, the E147A mutant supported robust, ATP-stimulated recruitment of MCM in these assays.

Discussion
aken together, our data yield insight into the evolution, regulation, and mechanism of replication initiation in the chromosome of ulfolobus species. e find that the chromosome is a mosaic of three distinct replicons, each with its own principal initiator protein. n particular, we note that initiation at ori. C3 is not impacted upon by individual or combined Orc1/Cdc6 deletions but is abrogated by loss of expression of the Cdt1 homolog WhiP. Intriguingly, parallels can be drawn with metazoa: in Drosophila, the origin recognition complex (ORC) is dispensable for endoreduplication, whereas Cdt1 is essential for this process (Park and Asano, 2008). We note that it was not possible for us to generate a triple Orc-1 mutation in which all three paralogs were deleted. Given that Orc1-2 does not bind inΒ vivo to any origin, we speculate that this synthetic lethality may reflect nonorigin roles for the Orc1/Cdc6 proteins. Indeed, our ChIP-seq analyses reveal multiple nonorigin genomic binding sites for the Orc1/Cdc6 proteins. Furthermore, the single mutants show significantly altered transcript profiles compared to WT cells (R.Y.S. and S.D.B., unpublished data). Thus, as with DnaA and eukaryal ORC proteins (Scholefield etΒ al., 2011), it appears that archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 proteins play roles in transcriptional regulation.
We speculate that the mosaic nature of the Sulfolobus chromosome has arisen by integration of extrachromosomal elements into an ancestral chromosome that presumably contained a single origin of replication. Given the broad conservation of Orc1-1 orthologs and their DNA binding sites across the archaeal domain of life (Robinson etΒ al., 2004), we suggest that the ancestral chromosome was dependent on Orc1-1 and oriC1. Because WhiP homologs are found in the Desulfurococcales and Sulfolobales and Orc1-3 is restricted to the Sulfolobales, we propose the sequential acquisition of first WhiP/oriC3 prior to the bifurcation of these two lineages, followed by integration of the Orc1-3/oriC2 replicon in the branch leading to the Sulfolobales. Interestingly, the genome replication mode of the bacterium Vibrio cholera also appears to have been sculpted by acquisition of extrachromosomal element replication origins. However, in that organism, the genome is split between two chromosomes, each with a single origin: one dependent on a classic bacterial oriC/DnaA system and the second having an origin with features reminiscent of plasmid origins. Indeed, this partitioning of bacterial genomes into multiple single-origin chromosomes is found in a range of bacterial species (Egan etΒ al., 2005; Egan and Waldor, 2003). In contrast, multiple-origin single-chromosome genomes are found in a number of archaea. Why are archaeal chromosomes permissive in this regard? One explanation may lie in the contrasting mechanisms for replication termination in bacteria versus archaea (Duggin etΒ al., 2008b; Toro and Shapiro, 2010). Whereas termination in bacteria involves polar fork traps, we have recently found that termination in Sulfolobus is by random fork collision (Duggin etΒ al., 2011). In support of this, our MFA data on the mutant strains in which only a single origin fires reveal that termination is repositioned to occur 180Β° across the chromosome from the active origin (FigureΒ 2F). An ectopic origin integrated into one replichore of a bacterial chromosome would result in premature arrival and prolonged stalling of a fork at a termination site. This may impact genome stability. In addition, because of the presence of the fork traps, the time taken to replicate a two-origin bacterial chromosome would still be dependent on the length of time it takes the fork arising from oriC to traverse the longest replichore. In contrast, the absence of active termination sites in Sulfolobus would mean that additional origins would simply result in repositioning of termination events to midway between active origins and a concomitant reduction in the total time spent in S phase, assuming similar timing of firing of the origins. The ability to accommodate and regulate multiple origins will have played a major role in permitting the increase in genome size seen in eukaryotic organisms (Diffley, 2011).
Our data also reveal mechanistic insight into the action of the Orc1-1 initiator. As with bacterial DnaA, we find that the ATP-bound form of the initiator is the active form (Kaguni, 2011; Mott and Berger, 2007). Our expression profiling reveals a wave of transcription of the genes for the Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 initiators immediately prior to the onset of replication. We propose that this imposes a temporal window for initiation in which the newly synthesized proteins bind to ATP and associates with origin DNA before hydrolysis of ATP to ADP inactivates the proteins. It may, therefore, be significant that Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 are encoded in the immediate vicinity of their cognate origins. Furthermore, expression of WT Orc1-1 driven by its native promoter from episomes, while resulting in origin occupancy (as adjudged by ChIP), fails to activate the origin, presumably due to hydrolysis of ATP in the cell prior to origin binding. However, expression of the Walker B ATP hydrolysis-defective mutant to the same level results in an overreplication phenotype.
In bacteria, the ATP-bound form of DnaA facilitates the formation of higher-order structures and is able to mediate localized DNA melting at the origin (Bramhill and Kornberg, 1988; Duderstadt etΒ al., 2011; Erzberger etΒ al., 2006; Katayama etΒ al., 2010; Ozaki etΒ al., 2008). Although we do observe a subpopulation of the Walker B mutant form of the protein existing as dimer in solution, we find that the ADP- and ATP-bound forms of Orc1-1 show equivalent DNA binding properties. Furthermore, we have been unable to observe any localized sensitivity to nuclease P1 or potassium permanganate, indicative of DNA melting, induced by either form of the protein (data not shown). Perhaps unsurprisingly, in this regard Orc1-1 is behaving in a manner more reminiscent of eukaryal ORC. There is no evidence for eukaryal ORC melting origins; rather, the available data support a model whereby MCM(2-7) is recruited to double-stranded DNA with duplex unwinding occurring at a later stage (Evrin etΒ al., 2009; Heller etΒ al., 2011; Remus etΒ al., 2009). We propose that this is an evolutionarily conserved feature of the Orc1/Cdc6 proteins and that these proteins act principally to define loci for MCM recruitment. In light of our protease sensitivity assays, we suggest that ATP acts to modulate the conformation of Orc1/Cdc6 proteins on the DNA binding site such that the protein is able to effectively recruit MCM. Subsequent hydrolysis of ATP to ADP by Orc1/Cdc6 then renders the protein incapable of recruiting further MCM, thereby contributing to the fidelity of replication control. This simple binary switch model of archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 function is supported by our observation of the overreplication phenotype mediated by the Walker B mutant of Orc1-1. We note that in budding yeast, temporally distinct ATP binding and hydrolysis events by both the ORC complex and Cdc6 are required for iterative MCM(2-7) loading at replication origins (Randell etΒ al., 2006). The increased organizational complexity of the eukaryotic origin definition and MCM recruitment system is likely a consequence of the increased regulatory demands imposed by the large number of replication origins found in eukaryotic chromosomes (Diffley, 2011). The simple binary-switch model that we propose for Orc1/Cdc6 function is clearly distinct from the mechanism of action of the bacterial initiator DnaA and provides a paradigm for the function of initiator proteins in archaea and eukaryotes.

Experimental rocedures
trains, edia, and rowth onditions. S.Β islandicus strain E233S (Ξ”pyrEF Ξ”lacS) constructed previously (Deng etΒ al., 2009) was used as the host for genetic manipulations. All archaeal strains used in this work, including the genetic host and its transformants of diverse plasmids as well as the orc1/whip, are summarized in Table S1. These archaeal cell lines were grown in SCVY (0.2% sucrose, 0.2% Casamino acids, 5Β ml vitamin solution, and 0.005% yeast extracts) or TYS (0.1% tryptone, 0.05% yeast extracts, and 0.2% sucrose) medium at 78Β°C. If required, uracil was supplemented to 20Β ΞΌg/ml while 5β€²-fluorooritic acid (5β€²-FOA) was added to 50Β ΞΌg/ml, in SCVY medium. Microscopy was performed as described previously (Samson etΒ al., 2011).Protein Purification and Biochemical AnalysesOrc1/Cdc6 and WhiP proteins were expressed in E.Β coli with C-terminal Hexa-His tags and purified as described previously (Robinson and Bell, 2007; Dueber etΒ al., 2007). EMSAs and footprinting were performed as described previously (Dueber etΒ al., 2007; Robinson etΒ al., 2004). The MCM recruitment assay was based on the approach initially established by Seki and Diffley (2000). A total of 10Β ΞΌg of a 5 kb plasmid (pCR Script containing a 2 kb sequence centered around oriC1 or a control locus, Sire_2328) was linearized by EcoRI and PstI digestion, the EcoRI-generated recessed end was filled in with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) and Biotin-14-dATP and dTTP. The DNA was recovered from the reaction mixture using QiaQuick column (QIAGEN) and immobilized on Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin beads following the manufacturerβ€™s recommendations (Life Technologies). Binding reactions were assembled in LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) and contained 200 pM DNA in 50Β ΞΌl of binding buffer (20Β mM Tris acetate, 50Β mM potassium acetate, 10Β mM magnesium acetate, 1Β mM DTT [pH 7.9] at 25Β°C) plus 20Β ng/ΞΌl poly(dGdC). Reactions were heated to 50Β°C in a water bath and buffer or Orc1-1 protein (1Β ΞΌM final) were added and supplemented with nucleotide to 2Β mM as indicated. Following a 10Β min incubation, 20Β ΞΌl of a 5Β mg/ml whole-cell extract of S.Β islandicus was added (see below). Then, 20Β ΞΌl of water or supplemental ATP to 2mM as indicated was added and the reaction incubated for a further 30Β min at 50Β°C before washing twice by magnet-mediated bead pelleting and resuspension in 100Β ΞΌl of prewarmed binding buffer, followed by one wash in 100Β ΞΌl binding buffer containing 500Β mM potassium acetate. Following this final wash, beads were resuspended in 1xSDS PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS PAGE followed by western blotting. All wash steps employed preheated buffers and were performed in the 50Β°C water bath. We observed a very high background of recombinant Orc1-1 protein bound to both DNA substrates and even to beads alone (data not shown), but MCM was only efficiently recruited to the origin-containing DNA substrate.The S.Β islandicus cell extract was prepared by growing cells to midexponential phase (OD 600Β nmΒ = 0.4) before harvesting and resuspension in 2x binding buffer (40Β mM Tris acetate, 100Β mM potassium acetate, 20Β mM magnesium acetate, 2Β mM DTT [pH 7.9] at 25Β°C). Cells were lysed using a FrenchPress (Thermo) and the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 23,700 g for 15Β min at 4Β°C. Then, 100Β ΞΌl aliquots were prepared in LoBind tubes and snap frozen on dry ice. Total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay to be 5Β mg/ml. Extracts were stored at β�’80Β°C.Flow CytometryFlow cytometry of S.Β islandicus cells was performed essentially as previously described for S.Β acidocaldarius (Duggin etΒ al., 2008a). Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and their DNAs were stained with Mithramycin A and analyzed with A-40 Apogee flow cytometer.Neutral-Neutral 2D Gel ElectrophoresisS.Β islandicus cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with TEN buffer (50Β mM Tris-Cl [pH 8], 50Β mM EDTA [pH 8], 100Β mM NaCl). Cell suspensions were then mixed with low-melting-point agarose and dispensed into Bio-Rad plug molds. Genomic DNA preparation and 2D gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (Robinson etΒ al., 2004). For further details, please refer to Extended Experimental Procedures.Chromatin ImmunoprecipitationChIP was performed as described by Robinson etΒ al. (2004). For further details, please refer to Extended Experimental Procedures.Extended Experimental ProceduresGene Knockout PlasmidsA novel gene deletion method recently developed for Sulfolobus islandicus REY15A (Deng etΒ al., 2009) was employed to construct gene knockouts of this archaeon for the three orc1 genes and the other putative replication initiator gene whip. This method β€�Marker cassette Integration and target gene Deletion (MID)β€� employs three homologous sequence arms, which are target gene arm (G-arm), left sequence arm (L-arm) and right sequence arm (R-arm). The positions of these arms in pLRMG plasmids are illustrated in FigureΒ S5. Primer pairs for each homologous sequence arm were designed to yield a PCR product of ca. 1 kb (Table S2).The marker cassette of pLRMG plasmids contained pyrE/F and lacS genes that code for orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine-5β€²-monophosphate decarboxylase and Ξ²-glycosidase, respectively. Using double markers enabled the transformants obtained on pyrEF selection to be verified by a simple X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-Ξ²-D- galactopyranoside) screening. TheseΒ marker genes were obtained by PCR amplification from the Sulfolobus-E. coli shuttle plasmid pHZ2lacS with the primer pair of pyrEF+lacS Fwd and pyrEF+lacS Rev (Table S2).The E.Β coli vector pUC19 was the vector for all pLRMG plasmids construction. The first plasmid pLRMG-orc1-1 was constructed in three steps: First, L-arm and R-arm PCR products were cleaved with SalIΒ + MluI and MluIΒ +EcoRI, respectively and ligated to pUC19 at SalI and EcoRI sites in a triple ligation, yielding pUC-LR. Second, the marker cassette was inserted into the PstI and SalI sites of pUC-LR, giving pUC-LRM. Last, the G-arm was inserted into pUC-LRM at SphI and PstI sites, generating the knockout plasmid pLRMG-orc1-1.Subsequent construction of other knockout plasmids to be used in this work was based on the pLRMG-orc1-1, following essentially the same strategy. Restriction sites used in pLRMG-orc1-2 and pLRMG-orc1-3 constructions included SphI and PstIΒ (G-arm); SalI and NcoI (L-arm); and NcoI and BamHI (R-arm). During cloning, a DNA fragment containing the marker cassette and the orc1-1 G-arm was cleaved off from pLRMG-orc1-1 with SphI and SalI and the yielded fragment was inserted into the corresponding sites on pUC19, yielding the pUC-M-orc1-1. Then, the orc1-1 G-arm was replaced with orc1-2 or orc1-3, yielding the pUC-M-orc1-2 or the pUC-M-orc1-3. Finally, triple ligations of pUC-M-orc1-2/-orc1-3 with their own L-arm and R-arm yielded pLRMG -orc1-2 and pLRMG-orc1-3, respectively.Construction of the Plasmid to Inactivate Genome Expression of WhIP Protein ExpressionTo study if the whip gene product could function in origin firing, it was essential to generate a mutant with complete whip gene sequence which lacks WhIP protein expression. For this purpose, we aimed to replace the WT whip gene with the mutant gene whipβ�— which carried three tandem stop codons. The oligonucleotide 5β€²-ACGCGTTAATGATAA β�’3β€² containing a Mlu I restriction site and three tandem stop codons was inserted between the first and the second codons of whip gene and expression from this whip mutant could only produce a peptide of three amino acids.Mutant gene whipβ�— was obtained by SOE-PCR with the four primers listed in Table S2 (under whipβ�—). Then, the SOE-PCR product was inserted into pUC19 at SalI and BamHI sites, yielding pUC-whipβ�—. Marker cassette (cleaved off from pLRMG-orc1-1 with PstI and SalI) was inserted to the pUC-whipβ�— to yield whipβ�— replacement plasmid pUC-M-whipβ�— (FigureΒ S5).Construction of orc1/whip Mutants of S.Β islandicusGeneration of pLRMG transformantsAll pLRMG plasmids were linearized by restriction digestion and 0.9-1ΞΌg linearized plasmid DNA was used to transform the genetic host S.Β islandicus E233S by electroporation as described previously (Deng etΒ al., 2009). After incubation at 78Β°C for 7-10Β days, colonies were screened with X-gal. Then, a few blue ones were picked up and inoculated in 6Β ml SCVY liquid medium in test tubes and incubated for 3β€“5Β days. The cultures were harvested and genomic DNA extracted. The target gene alleles of these transformants were analyzed by PCR with verifying primer pairs (Table S3).Isolation of gene deletion mutants by counter-selecting transformants with 5β€²-FOA.Once pLRMG-orc1/whip transformants were purified such that the WT allele of the target gene could not be amplified by PCR in the cultures, the transformant cells were diluted and spread onto plates containing uracil and 5β€²-FOA. Colonies appeared after 7-days incubation. These colonies were first screened with X-gal and a few white colonies were then grown in SCVY medium supplemented with uracil and 5-FOA.Target gene alleles were checked again by PCR and mutant cell lines were confirmed to possess only the deleted target gene allele.Construction of orc1 double mutantsA second orc1 gene was to be deleted from a Ξ”orc1 mutant strain to yield double orc1 knockouts. Ξ”orc1-1 was the host for constructing Ξ”orc1-1 Ξ”orc1-2 and Ξ”orc1-1 Ξ”orc1-3 double mutants whereas Ξ”orc1-2 was the host for constructing Ξ”orc1-2 Ξ”orc1-3 mutant and this was done by following single orc1 mutant construction as described above.Construction of the Translation-Stop Mutant Gene whipβ�—The construction of a whipβ�— mutant with three tandem stop codons was a two-steps process (FigureΒ S6). The first step was to select single crossover transformants of the constructed pUC-M-whipβ�—. 1Β ΞΌg of the plasmid was used to transform the genetic host E233S. Upon entering the cell, homologous recombination between the host genome and the plasmid led to pUC-M-whipβ�— integration either at Up-seq or Dn-seq. Recombination at Dn-seq was exemplified in FigureΒ S6. After purification, the pUC-M-whipβ�— transformants were subjected to counter selection. Cell lines carrying either the WT or mutant whip gene could both grow in the presence of 5-FOA and Uracil. Because a MluI site was introduced into whipβ�—, mutants carrying whipβ�— were readily identified by digesting the PCR product of whip with MluI.Analysis of Protein Levels by Western Blot AnalysisSulfolobus cultures of exponential growth were adjusted to OD600Β = 0.2 with SCVY. 10Β ml of culture was taken and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.2Β ml H2O. After adding 0.2Β ml 2Β Γ— SDS PAGE buffer, the samples were heated at 99Β°C for 10Β min to lyse the cells and denature proteins. Total cellular proteins were then analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis was conducted using antisera against S.Β solfataricus Orc1-1, β�’2, β�’3, WhiP protein or PCNA2 or PCNA3 (the latter proteins serving as loading controls). The signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and recorded with X-ray film.Neutral-Neutral 2D Gel ElectrophoresisS.Β islandicus cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with TEN buffer (50Β mM Tris-Cl, pH 8; 50Β mM EDTA, pH 8; 100Β mM NaCl). Cell suspensions were then mixed with low melting point agarose and dispensed into Bio-Rad plug molds. Genomic DNA preparation and 2D gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (Robinson etΒ al., 2004). Specifically, the agarose plugs were digested in NDS buffer (10Β mM Tris, pH 9.5; 0.5Β M EDTA, pH 8.0; 1% lauroyl sarcosine) containing 1Β mg/ml Proteinase K for 48Β hr at 37Β°C. The plugs were then equilibrated in an appropriate restriction buffer before digesting withΒ 500-1000 units of restriction enzyme for approximately 16Β hr. See FigureΒ S3 for restriction maps of the oriC loci and probe position. A 0.4% agarose gel was poured around the plugs and run for approximately 20Β hr at 1 V/cm at 4Β°C. Lanes containing DNA were excised from the gel, rotated 90Β°, and incorporated into a 1% agarose gel containing 0.3Β ΞΌg/ml ethidium bromide.Β Electrophoresis in the second dimension was carried out at 5 V/cm for 6-7Β hr at 4Β°C. The DNA was depurinated in 0.25Β M HCl, then denatured and transferred in 0.5Β M NaOH, 10X SSC to Hybond-XL membrane (GE Healthcare) by capillary transfer according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions. 32P-labeled probes (FigureΒ S7; Table S4) were prepared according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions using the NEBlot kit (New England Biolabs). Hybridizations were performed in Church-Gilbert buffer (0.5Β M sodium phosphate, 1Β mM EDTA, 1% BSA, 7% SDS) at 65Β°C and washes were performed as described in the Hybond-XL manual. Membranes were exposed to phosphoimager screens which were subsequently scanned on an FLA-5000 phosphoimager (Fujifilm).Chromatin ImmunoprecipitationChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described in (Robinson etΒ al., 2004) Early logarithmic cultures of S.Β islandicus were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 20Β min. After quenching with 125Β mM glycine, the cells were pelleted and washed with 1X PBS. The pellets were resuspended in TBS-TT (20Β mM Tris, 150Β mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5), passed through a French press three times at 20,000 psi, and sonicated using a Diagenode Bioruptor to generate DNA fragments ranging from 200-1000Β bp. The extract was then clarified by centrifugation. 10Β ΞΌg of extract (based on protein concentration) were used in each 100Β ΞΌl ChIP reaction. Samples were rotated for 2-3Β hr with 3Β ΞΌl of antiserum at 4Β°C. 25Β ΞΌl of a 50% slurry of protein A sepharose were then added and the samples were rotated for another hour at 4Β°C. Each ChIP reaction was then washed five times at room temperature with TBS-TT, once with TBS-TT containing 500Β mM NaCl, and once with TBS-TT containing 0.5% Tween-20 and 0.5% Triton X-100. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the protein A sepharose in 20Β mM Tris, 10Β mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.8 at 65Β°C for 30Β min. Crosslinking was reversed and protein was digested by incubating the samples with 10Β ng/ΞΌl Proteinase K for 6Β hr at 65Β°C followed by 10Β hr at 37Β°C. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol first, then chloroform alone and the DNA was precipitated in 100% ethanol containing 20Β ΞΌg of glycogen. After washing with 70% ethanol and air-drying, the DNA was resuspended in 50Β ΞΌl TE buffer. Recovered DNA were either subjected to quantitative PCR or prepared for next generation sequencing on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Source Bioscience, UK). Single end sequence reads were mapped to the S.islandicus genome using Genious (http://www.geneious.com). The resultant data were exported as .bam files and subsequently analyzed using SeqMonk (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/). Read counts were quantified in 20Β bp windows and was normalized to input DNA.For qPCR, SYBR detection assays were performed in triplicate using 1Β ΞΌl of ChIP DNA as template, forward and reverse primers at 125Β nM final concentration (Table S5), and Stratagene 2X Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix according to the manufacturerβ€™s instructions. Standard curves were prepared in duplicate using ChIP input DNA as template. qPCR reactions and melting curves were performed and analyzed using a Mastercycler ep realplex2 machine and included analysis software (Eppendorf).Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analysis of Orc1-1Orc1-1 (WT and Walker B E147A) proteins were analyzed via sedimentation velocity using a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge. In each experiment, 450Β ΞΌl of a 20Β ΞΌM protein solution were loaded into a sector shaped graphite centrifugation cell. The protein was centrifuged at 50,000Β rpm for eight hours while radial scans of absorbance captured the boundary distribution every two minutes until the sample had completely pelleted.Boundary profiles from sedimentation velocity scans were collected and analyzed using the UltraScan II software suite (Demeler, 2005). Evidence of a highly pure system was observed via model independent enhanced van Holde-Weischet analysis of the dataΒ (Demeler etΒ al., 1997) for WT as well as the Walker B mutant. This revealed a tight distribution of the sedimentation coefficient around a value of 3.7 s. Subsequent processing of the complete sedimentation velocity data sets employed 50 iterations of a Genetic Algorithm-Monte Carlo (GA-MC50) model (Brookes and Demeler, 2006). FigureΒ S4 illustrates that the model is able to successfully reproduce the boundary distributions for both species.Protease Sensitivity Assays5Β ΞΌg of purified, recombinant, WT and Walker B mutant Orc1-1 were digested with 0.5Β ng/ΞΌl trypsin (Roche, sequencing grade) in 100Β mM Tris (pH 8.5), 2Β mM magnesium acetate, 2Β mM ATP, and either 11Β ΞΌM double-stranded ORB2 or an equivalent volume of water. Samples were removed at 0, 10, 30Β min, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 22Β hr for time course experiments and at 0 and 22Β hr for endpoint digestions. Trypsin digestion was quenched by adding samples to 2.5X protease inhibitor (Roche Complete EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). An equal volume of 2X SDS-PAGE loading dye was then added to the reactions and the samples were run on 4%β€“12% Bis-Tris gradient gels before being stained with Coomassie dye. All time course and endpoint experiments were performed a minimum of 5 times each. A representative gel is shown in FigureΒ 7. Mass spectrometry was performed by the Oxford Proteomics Facility.
