The proliferation, directional migration to the vitreous and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of quiescent, differentiated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells is a major feature in the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) following exposure of the immuno-privileged eye niche to serum components, thrombin among them. We have previously documented thrombin induction of RPE cell proliferation and migration. We here analyzed the effect of thrombin on the E/N cadherin switch, a hallmark of EMT. Results show that thrombin induces the specific repression of epithelial E-cadherin gene transcription, alongside with the up-regulation of mesenchymal N-cadherin protein in RPE cells. We demonstrate, for the first time, that thrombin induces E-cadherin repression by stimulating snail-2 (SLUG) transcription factor expression, and the concomitant up-regulation of N-cadherin through the transcription-independent increase in protein translation promoted by PI3K/PKC-Î¶/mTOR signaling. Our present findings suggest that the activation of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by thrombin induces EMT of RPE cells, further supporting a central role for thrombin in PVR pathogenesis.
