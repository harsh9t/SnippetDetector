<abstract>
Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a predominantly recessive platelet disorder that is characterized by mild thrombocytopenia with large platelets and a paucity of α-granules; these abnormalities cause mostly moderate but in rare cases severe bleeding. We sequenced the exomes of four unrelated individuals and identified NBEAL2 as the causative gene; it has no previously known function but is a member of a gene family that is involved in granule development. Silencing of nbeal2 in zebrafish abrogated thrombocyte formation.

Platelets are the second most abundant cell in the blood and maintain arterial vessel wall integrity. ormation of the platelet plug at the site of vessel wall damage is a multi-step process of tethering and attachment followed by activation that causes the release of both the ±- and ΄-granules. latelets are anucleate and formed in large numbers in the bone marrow by polyploid precursor cells, named megakaryocytes (s). he lack of adequate numbers or impaired function of platelets can result in bleeding.  was first defined in 1971 when it was observed that in some cases with an inherited bleeding disorder a ay-r. ΓΌnwald-Giemsa stained blood smear showed gray platelets with increased diameter1. Electron microscopic studies revealed a complete lack of Ξ±-granules in most cases2 (Fig. 1a). Since the Ξ±-granule protein cargo is essential to the development of a robust platelet plug, GPS cases are symptomatic at platelet count levels that are typically not associated with bleeding. Proteins normally only released upon platelet activation are spontaneously released from MKs; most likely because of the lack of Ξ±-granules3.

A recent study established significant linkage of a locus on chromosome 3p21 to , but the causative gene has remained elusive so far4,5. e therefore sequenced the exomes of four unrelated cases with  (upplementary able 1-2, upplementary ig. 1, upplementary ote), using the gilent ure. Select protocol to enrich for 39.3 Mb of coding sequence and the Illumina GAII platform6. GPS is an extremely rare disorder, illustrated by the fact that there are about 30 documented cases in France; cases typically occur in families consistent with a recessive disorder4. We hypothesized that the causative variants would be novel, and filtered out variants seen previously and those not likely to affect protein function (Online Methods). Assuming a recessive mode of inheritance we required at least two novel mutations per individual in the same gene.

We found that only for the eurobeachin-like 2 gene (2), encoding a member of the family of  domain containing proteins, on chromosome 3 (3p21) all cases had at least two novel mutations with a predicted functional consequence for the protein, with two homozygous cases and two compound heterozygotes (able 1, ig. 1b). ll mutations and genotypes were confirmed by capillary sequencing (not shown). ased on theoretical calculations we estimate that the probability of the observed mutation pattern occurring by chance is ~5 — 10β�’11 (upplementary ote). urthermore, we established correct segregation in a further five relatives, two unaffected and three affected ones, in pedigrees ,  and  and identified the affected father (..2) of case ..3 as homozygous for the causative mutation, compatible with the known consanguinity in this pedigree (upplementary ote). he mutations were at eight different locations in the 2,754 amino acid long beal2 protein and were absent in 994 low-pass samples from the main phase of the 1000 enomes roject7. xcept for mutation 2553 in case ..3, all affected residues for the ns. SNPs are highly conserved, as well as the splice site disrupted by the 7-base pair insertion in the same case (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2-9). The eight mutations affect multiple exons of NBEAL2 and multiple protein domains, with the P2100L and S2269L variants being located in the BEACH domain itself. Modeling based on the fold of the homologous PH-BEACH structure from NBEA8 (>50% identity at the amino acid level) shows that the environment of the former mutation would introduce clashes in a tightly-packed location of a hydrophobic pocket and the latter would potentially lead to local changes in conformation (Supplementary Fig. 10).

To verify the biological importance we silenced the nbeal2 orthologous gene by injecting specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides () into one cell stage zebrafish embryos (upplementary ig. 11). his resulted in a lineage-specific effect with a complete abrogation of thrombocyte formation, but normal erythropoiesis (ig. 1c, d). pontaneous bleeding in the tail was observed in 41% of the embryos (ig. 1e and upplementary ig. 11). he phenotype in -injected zebrafish is more severe than the observed phenotype of  cases, which may be expected due to the difference between a null-phenotype in zebrafish and a loss of function one in the  cases. lthough the experiment did not address the function of ±-granules in thrombocytes, these results support the essential role of the beal2 protein in thrombopoiesis and the etiology of .To verify the biological importance we silenced the nbeal2 orthologous gene by injecting specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) into one cell stage zebrafish embryos (Supplementary Fig. 11). This resulted in a lineage-specific effect with a complete abrogation of thrombocyte formation, but normal erythropoiesis (Fig. 1c, d). Spontaneous bleeding in the tail was observed in 41% of the embryos (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 11). The phenotype in MO-injected zebrafish is more severe than the observed phenotype of GPS cases, which may be expected due to the difference between a null-phenotype in zebrafish and a loss of function one in the GPS cases. Although the experiment did not address the function of Ξ±-granules in thrombocytes, these results support the essential role of the Nbeal2 protein in thrombopoiesis and the etiology of GPS.

Other members of the family of  domain proteins include bea, beal1, rba and yst (upplementary ig. 12) and are believed to be important in membrane protein trafficking9. ike other  members except for 1, 2 is expressed in s and indeed is upregulated during megakaryopoiesis (upplementary ig. 13-14). utations in other  members affect vesicle function in both man and mice. aplo-insufficiency of the  gene caused by a chromosomal rearrangement in an individual with extreme autism was associated with atypical platelet ΄-granules, suggestive of a possible role of bea in their formation10, while the platelet ±-granules were normal. n contrast with bea, which in mouse is required for the formation and functioning of central neuronal synapses11, 2 is not expressed in fetal and whole brain (upplementary ig. 15), consistent with the lack of neurological phenotypes in cases with . utations in the  gene that result in the truncation of the /40 domains or the total absence of the yst protein lead to a dysregulation of lysosomal trafficking and are causative of hediak-igashi syndrome12, for which symptoms include a platelet-type bleeding due to inadequate formation of ΄-granules13. owever, there was no previously known function for 2 and it is has not been associated with common or rare disease, and is absent from any of the 68 quantitative trait loci that were identified in a recent  meta-analysis for the number and volume of platelets in 68,000 healthy individuals (. oranzo, unpublished data). aken together, these findings are consistent with a role for beal2 in the development or secretion of platelet ±-granules, whereby individuals with recessive mutations have impaired platelet activation and plug formation, resulting in a propensity for bleeding.Other members of the family of BEACH domain proteins include Nbea, Nbeal1, Lrba and Lyst (Supplementary Fig. 12) and are believed to be important in membrane protein trafficking9. Like other BEACH members except for NBEAL1, NBEAL2 is expressed in MKs and indeed is upregulated during megakaryopoiesis (Supplementary Fig. 13-14). Mutations in other BEACH members affect vesicle function in both man and mice. Haplo-insufficiency of the NBEA gene caused by a chromosomal rearrangement in an individual with extreme autism was associated with atypical platelet Ξ΄-granules, suggestive of a possible role of Nbea in their formation10, while the platelet Ξ±-granules were normal. In contrast with Nbea, which in mouse is required for the formation and functioning of central neuronal synapses11, NBEAL2 is not expressed in fetal and whole brain (Supplementary Fig. 15), consistent with the lack of neurological phenotypes in cases with GPS. Mutations in the LYST gene that result in the truncation of the BEACH/WD40 domains or the total absence of the Lyst protein lead to a dysregulation of lysosomal trafficking and are causative of Chediak-Higashi syndrome12, for which symptoms include a platelet-type bleeding due to inadequate formation of Ξ΄-granules13. However, there was no previously known function for NBEAL2 and it is has not been associated with common or rare disease, and is absent from any of the 68 quantitative trait loci that were identified in a recent GWAS meta-analysis for the number and volume of platelets in 68,000 healthy individuals (N. Soranzo, unpublished data). Taken together, these findings are consistent with a role for Nbeal2 in the development or secretion of platelet Ξ±-granules, whereby individuals with recessive mutations have impaired platelet activation and plug formation, resulting in a propensity for bleeding.

Our result is supported by the findings of two previous linkage studies. unay et al. found that 19 affected individuals in 11 out of 14 pedigrees (one being case ..3 from this study) analyzed in total were homozygous in the region chr3:42688625-52061914 on 3p21, which contains 2, together with a significant linkage of log-odds () ratio of 7.2 in the largest pedigree4. hey sequenced 69% of all exons in the homozygous interval, but no gene was identified. n a separate linkage study, abbro et al. reported a  score of 2.7 for the same locus and subsequently identified four affected individuals from two pedigrees that were completely homozygous and one individual that was mostly homozygous for the region chr3:48487338-50187790, which does not include 25. argeted next-generation resequencing of this region did not identify a causative gene. nterestingly, the segregation pattern inferred from microsatellite markers in the two pedigrees is consistent with compound heterozygosity for an interval that does contain 2, and based on mixed ethnicity in one pedigree the authors raised this as a possibility5.Our result is supported by the findings of two previous linkage studies.

In summary, we identified multiple novel mutations in 2, a gene with no previously known function, in ray latelet yndrome, a known recessive disorder. t is consistent with an important role for beal2 in the formation of ±-granules and this discovery may lead to the development of a novel generation of safer anti-platelet drugs for use in the treatment of individuals with heart attacks and stroke.  comparison with two previous linkage studies demonstrates the power of directly observing sequence variation for resolving complex segregation patterns, in particular combinations of compound heterozygosity and homozygosity.In summary, we identified multiple novel mutations in NBEAL2, a gene with no previously known function, in Gray Platelet Syndrome, a known recessive disorder.

Methods
equencing. We applied the Agilent SureSelect protocol (Agilent, South Queensferry, UK, catalogue no. G3362A) to enrich for 39.3 Mb of sequence covering 740K exons in 79K transcripts from a highly redundant set of 34,642 genes. The enriched DNA was sequenced on the Illumina GAII platform (Illumina, Little Chesterford, UK). We generated 11.7-13.4 Gb of sequence per individual, resulting in a mean coverage of 103-112-fold and 88.3-92.3% of the sites within 25 bp of the targets covered at least ten-fold.Sequence analysisThe sequence analysis was divided into three phases with the first one consisting of aligning and recalibrating the reads to produce a BAM file15. The second phase consisted of calling the sequence variants using various algorithms. The third phase consisted of filtering the set of variants.First phase:
The FastQ files generated by the sequencing pipeline were aligned to reference NCBI build 37 using the Stampy read mapper16.For each lane independently, the reads were realigned around known insertions and deletions (indels) (1000 Genomes pilot project,7), followed by base quality recalibration using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)17.After merging the different lanes, duplicates were flagged using the Picard software package18 and excluded from subsequent analyses.Second phase:
Indels were called using Dindel19 on each sample independently.The reads were realigned in the BAM files produced in phase 1 around the indels called by Dindel using the GATK, in order to reduce alignment artefacts around all indels found in a sample.The GATK software package and SAMtools were used to call Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)15. We called SNPs both for each sample independently and jointly using all samples. Furthermore, SNPs were called both from the BAM files produced in phase 1 and in step 2 of the second phase, so that SNPs were called using six different approaches. The joint calling was performed using exome sequencing results of 32 additional DNA samples from individuals with unrelated clinical phenotypes on the realigned BAM files produced in step 2 of the second phase.We required a minimum variant quality of 20, which corresponds to a 99% confidence level. Furthermore, we removed variants with more than 10 reads with mapping quality 0 as a proxy for regions in the genome where mappings are likely unreliable.Third phase:
Variants that did not overlap the targeted regions Β±25 bp were filtered and not considered in further analyses.We predicted the functional consequence of SNPs and small indels using the Ensembl Variation API20.We considered only non-synonymous (ns) SNPs, SNPs introducing a premature stop-codon, indels in protein coding sequence, and variants affecting 3β€²UTRs and essential splice sites.Each variation was annotated for presence in databases of genetic variation. Any variant found to be present was not considered as a candidate for GPS. The following public databases were used: dbSNP131, SNPs from 8 HapMap exomes21, the 1000 Genomes pilot project SNPs and indels7. In addition to these public resources we made also use of the variation data observed in 354 exomes from the CoLaus cohort, which have been sequenced at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute as part of a partnership between the Sanger Institute, the CoLaus principal investigators (P Vollenweider, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Center, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (V Mooser, GSK, Philadelphia, USA)14. We also used as a filter the variants called on 32 exomes sequenced on the same platform for unrelated studies, which allowed us to correct for systematic errors in the variant calling.Statistical significance of observed mutationsWe estimated the significance of the novel mutations identified in the four exome-sequenced GPS cases using a dynamic programming approach based on the coalescent. The coalescent is a mathematical description of the notion that ultimately all individuals are related through a single common ancestor22.Since the observed mutation pattern is extremely rare and generally would only expected to be seen by conditioning on a rare event, for instance the presence of a rare phenotype, permutation analyses would not provide an accurate estimate of the significance.We therefore assume a population of Na chromosomes of affected individuals, and Nu chromosomes of unaffected individuals. The infinite site model provides an estimate of the number of variable sites in genomic segment of length L through the population-scaled mutation rate ΞΈ. The relationship ΞΈ = 4NeΞΌ, relates the population scaled mutation rate to Ne, the effective population size, and ΞΌ, the per-generation mutation rate. Here, we assumed an effective population size of 23000, which is based on the mutation rate ΞΌ=1.1 Γ— 10β�’8 estimated from trios7 and a heterozygosity of 0.001 for SNPs. We use the standard expression for the probability density of the number of variable sites in the infinite sites model and the allele frequency prior given that a site is variable (see e.g. Wakeley et al. 22).The purpose of the dynamic programming is to calculate the probability that given k previous sites, the next variable site k+1 is a site with frequency count at most fmax, and that the derived allele is present only on chromosomes of affected individuals; conditional on this event, we calculate the probability that such a mutation at site k+1 is present on the chromosomes of affected individuals that had no previous mutations (up to site k) satisfying the same criteria. Weighted by the probability of observing k variable sites, this then provides an estimate of the probability that all chromosomes of affected individuals carry at least one mutation of frequency at most fmax and not present in controls.Zebrafish experimentsZebrafish husbandryGeneral maintenance, collection, and staging of the wild type and transgenic Tg(cd41:EGFP) zebrafish were carried out according to the Zebrafish Book23. Embryos were maintained in egg water (60 mg/L Red Sea salts) at 28Β°C until the appropriate stage.O-Dianisidine stainingO-Dianisidine staining for haemoglobin was performed as previously described24. In brief, unfixed embryos were dechorionated and stained for 10 minutes in the dark, with a solution consisting of o-Dianisidine (0.7 mg/ml), 0.01 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 0.65% hydrogen peroxide and 45% (vol/vol) ethanol. Photomicrographs were taken with a Zeiss camera AxioCam HRC attached to a LeicaMZ16 FA dissecting microscope.Nbeal2 antisense oligonucleotidesMorpholinos (MO) targeting zebrafish nbeal2 atg (5β€²-TCGAAGCCATTCTCCCTCGCCCTTC-3β€²) and standard control MO (5β€²-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3β€²) were obtained from GeneTools LLC (Philomath, Oregon). The MO were resuspended in sterile water and approximately 0.8 nl was injected in zebrafish embryos, at the one cell stage. For both nbeal2 atg MO and the standard control MO a concentration of 1 ΞΌg/ΞΌl was used.Expression of BEACH domain containing genes in tissuesTranscript profiling of blood cells and blood cell precursorsData about transcript levels of in the above cells were extracted from a compendium of expression data sets generated by the Bloodomics Consortium and which in part have been released via Array Express at the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk). Two main datasets have been used in this study: i) the HaemAtlas25 which encompasses the results of whole genome expression (WGE) studies performed with RNA samples from the eight main blood cell types, including megakaryocytes (MKs) and erythroblasts (EBs) and ii) the WGE results obtained with the RNA samples from CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and from a study of paired HSC cultures that were differentiated towards MKs and EBs. Cells were harvested during the 10-day culture at five time points in time (days 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10).HaemAtlas25The purification of blood cells is described in25. In short, RNA was isolated from the six main blood cell types (CD4+ Th (CD4, n=7) and CD8+ Tc lymphocytes (CD8, n=7), CD14+ monocytes (CD14, n=7), CD19+ B lymphocytes (CD19, n=7), CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells (CD56, n=7) and CD66b+ granulocytes (CD66, n=7) obtained from seven healthy blood donors from the Cambridge BioResource and from MKs and EBs. The latter two cells were obtained by cultures of cord blood-derived CD34+ HSCs. MKs were obtained by cultures for 7 days in a medium supplemented with human recombinant thrombopoietin (THPO) and interleukin-1Γ� (IL1B) and the latter by cultures for 10 days in the presence of erythropoietin (EPO), interleukin-3 (IL3) and stem cell factor (SCF). To ensure high level purity preparations of both MKs and EBs, cells were flow-sorted using monoclonal antibodies against CD markers: MKs were positive for CD41 and negative for CD34; EBs were negative for CD41 and positive for CD235a. RNA was prepared from two sets of four cell preparations each.Platelet Whole-Genome Expression dataPlatelet RNA was isolated using a Trizol standard protocol. Total RNA was quantified using the NanoDrop (Labtech International) and quality-checked using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Standard protocols were applied to generate biotinylated cRNA and hybridize to Illumina BeadChips HumanWG-6 v2. Then, arrays were washed and scanned. All experimental procedures were carried out according to the manufacturerβ€™s protocol.Time-course study of MK and EB culturesTo capture changes in transcript levels over time during the proliferation and differentiation of HSCs towards MKs and EBs paired cultures were generated as described above using CD34+ HSCs from three cord blood donations. Umbilical cord blood of three healthy newborns was collected into cord blood collections bags (MacoPharma, Mouvaux, France) with parental informed consent. CD34+ HSCs were prepared as in26 and 92-98% pure CD34+ HSCs were in vitro cultured (1Γ—105/ml) for 10 days in serum-free media (CellGro-SCGM, Cellgenix, France) supplemented with 50 ng/ml THPO (CellGenix, France) and 10 ng/ml IL1B (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK) to differentiate into MKs. EBs were in vitro derived from HSCs (5Γ—103/ml) in the presence of 6 U/ml EPO (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), 10 ng/ml IL3 (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK) and 100 ng/ml SCF (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). MKs and EBs were harvested at day 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10 as described in26 and transferred for RNA isolation into a 5 ml tube, centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min at RT, resuspended in Trizol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and stored at β�’80Β°C. Total RNA was isolated according to manufacturerβ€™s instructions. The following murine monoclonal antibodies were used for phenotyping of both lineages at day 10: Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) IgG1 isotype control, Phycoerythrin (PE) IgG1 isotype control, Allophycocyanin (APC) IgG1 isotype control, PE-Cy5 IgG1 isotype control and Pacific Blue (PB) isotype control (BD Bioscience Pharmingenβ„Ά, Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK), anti-CD11c V450, anti-CD13 APC, anti-CD14 PB, anti-CD15 V450, anti-CD33 FITC (BD Bioscience Pharmingenβ„Ά), anti-CD34 PE (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK), anti-CD36 PE, anti-CD41a APC, anti-CD42a FITC, anti-CD235a FITC and anti-CD66c PE (BD Bioscience Pharmingenβ„Ά). For phenotyping of cells at all other days anti-CD34 PE and anti-CD41a APC, anti-CD42a FITC and anti-CD235a FITC with matching isotype controls were used. In addition, a ploidy stain of the MKs was performed at each day of harvest as described in26. In brief, cells were stained with anti-CD41a APC and with matched isotype control and incubated at 37Β°C for 30 min in 500 ΞΌl PBE buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, RNAse A (0.1 mg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.05 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). Samples were analysed using a 9-colour Cyan-ADP flow cytometer running Summit software version 4.3.02 (Beckman Coulter).Sequencing of megakaryocyte RNATotal RNA was prepared from MKs that were obtained using the culture protocol described above and extraction of RNA was according to the Trizol method (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The RNA pellet was resuspended in nuclease-free water (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and analysis by Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) gave a RNA integrity number (RIN)27 number of 8.4. Following DNAse treatment (Turbo DNA-Free, Applied Biosystems), 5 ΞΌg of total RNA was applied to the mRNA Sequencing kit (Illumina) following the manufacturerβ€™s instructions, except that PCR was performed before gel extraction of a band range of 300-450 bp, to obtain the purified library. This was quantified by qPCR followed by paired-end sequencing by GAII analyser (Illumina).Paired-end 76 bp RNA-seq reads were obtained for the in-vitro derived MK samples (above). We sequenced one lane on the Illumina GAIIx and obtained 40,539,150 reads. The data were initially assessed using the FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.1328 and the ShortRead29 package from version 2.7 of the Bioconductor project. Reads were then aligned to the February 2009 Homo sapiens high coverage assembly (Hg19) using TopHat v1.2.030. Default parameters allow for up to 40 alignments per read with a maximum of 2 mismatches. The alignments here were produced using more stringent parameters where only a single unique alignment was allowed per read. We used BEDTools31 to calculate the read coverage from the alignments, and visualized the results on the IGV browser32 using the Ensembl annotation.
