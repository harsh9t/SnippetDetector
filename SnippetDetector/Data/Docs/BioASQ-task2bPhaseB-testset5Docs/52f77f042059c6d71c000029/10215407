Important symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant disorder, are hamartomata in several organs, mental retardation and epilepsy. Either one of two loci can be involved (TSC1 and TSC2), of which the TSC2 gene has been cloned. To date, only 35 mutations in the TSC2 gene have been described ranging from large deletions to point mutations. Southern blot analysis using cDNA clones of the TSC2 gene was performed on a cohort of 160 unrelated TSC patients and revealed a 10 kb insertion. The insertion was also present in DNA of the affected father. Both patients showed renal angiomyolipoma, hypomelanotic macules and epilepsy. SSCP analysis of exons 1,2,3,9,12,14,30a and 36 identified two mutations in exon 30a: 3671del8 and S1221X. Symptoms of the sporadic patient with the 3671del8 mutation are cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, facial angiofibroma, ungual fibroma, renal angiomyolipoma, hypomelanotic macules, epilepsy and mental retardation. Clinical symptoms of the patient with the S1221X mutation are facial angiofibroma, ungual fibroma, hypomelanotic macules, epilepsy and mental retardation. His parents were negative for the S1221X mutation, although a germline mosaicism can not be excluded. Besides the previously described polymorphism 1596C->T, two rare variants were observed, a substitution of C->T at position 1294 and at position 1299 C->A.
