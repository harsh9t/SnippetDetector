Hepatic manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex: a genotypic and phenotypic analysis. A retrospective review of the clinical records and radiological images of 205 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was performed to evaluate the prevalence and progression of hepatic lesions; examine the association of hepatic phenotype with genotype, age, and gender; and investigate the relationships between hepatic, renal, and pulmonary involvement. Hepatic angiomyolipomas (AML), cysts, and other benign lesions were identified in 30% of the cohort, and some lesions grew significantly over time. However, no patient had clinical symptoms or complications from hepatic lesions. TSC2 patients exhibited a higher frequency of AML compared to TSC1 patients (p = 0.037), and patients with no mutation identified exhibited a higher frequency of cysts compared to TSC2 patients (p = 0.023). Age was positively correlated with frequency of hepatic involvement (p < 0.001), whereas hepatic phenotype was independent of gender. Presence of hepatic AML was associated with presence of renal AML (p = 0.001). These findings confirm a high rate of asymptomatic hepatic lesions in TSC and further characterize the TSC phenotype.
