<abstract>
The authors examined 16 patients with tuberous sclerosis by computed tomography. In all patients calcifications were revealed, in the majority with a subependymal location, in 10 patients a medium severe hydrocephalus, in four a vaguely defined hypodensity, in two patients true tumours (astrocytomas). In six patients the clinical symptoms were atypical; in those instances computed tomography makes diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis possible. These findings are supplemented by data from the literature.
