The authors report their experience of 11 cases of renal angiomyolipoma over an interval of 20 years, observed in 10 women (90.9%) and one man (9.1%) with a mean age of 46 years (range: 21 to 63). Clinical symptoms were dominated by loin pain (100%), haematuria (45.4%), lumbar mass (72.7%), fever (18%). In one woman, AML was associated with "tuberous sclerosis". Preoperatively, the diagnosis was established by ultrasound and CT scan in 45.4% of patients. The size of the tumour varied from 7 to 14 cm in 10 patients and in one patient was only about 3.6 cm. Two women had bilateral tumours. Treatment consisted of total nephrectomy in 7 patients, partial nephrectomy in 3 patients and tumourectomy in one patient. The purpose of this study is to analyse the epidemiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of this disease.
