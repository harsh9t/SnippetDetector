<abstract>
Cardiac tumours have been frequently reported in patients with tuberous sclerosis but their incidence at different ages has been evaluated in only a few studies. We performed echocardiography in 47 children with tuberous sclerosis and found tumours in 22 (47%). In none, except one newborn, did we observe any clinical symptoms of heart failure. Tumours were more frequent in children below 2 years of age (91%) than in older children. As other signs of tuberous sclerosis are often absent in infants, echocardiography may be regarded as the most useful diagnostic test at this age. Follow up studies were done in 12 children and tumour regression occurred in 6 patients.
