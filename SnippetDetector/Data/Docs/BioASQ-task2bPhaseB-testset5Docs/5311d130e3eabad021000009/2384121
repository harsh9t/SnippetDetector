The purpose of the study was to determine whether oxiracetam crosses the human blood-brain barrier and to evaluate its comparative kinetics in serum and in cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). Six DAT patients, undergoing CSF collection for diagnostic purposes, received 2 g oxiracetam daily, by a 60 min i.v. infusion, for 7 days. On the last day, in four patients blood samples were collected at time 0, 30, 60 and 120 min, and lumbar drainage was performed at the end of infusion: at this time mean CSF concentration was 3.5 micrograms/ml, i.e. 4.0% of the serum one, demonstrating that oxiracetam crosses the blood-brain barrier. In two patients, blood samples were collected at time 0, 60, 120 and 240 min, and lumbar drainage was performed 60 min after the end of infusion: at this time mean CSF concentration was 2.8 micrograms/ml, i.e. 5.3% of the serum one, indicating a persistence of oxiracetam within this deep compartment. These results provide the first evidence in humans that oxiracetam penetrates the central nervous system and contribute to the understanding of its long-lasting pharmacodynamic effect in man.
