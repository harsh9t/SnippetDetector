This study describes fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous intratumoral injection therapy (PIIT) with a pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion in the management of recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas after surgical excision. Seven patients underwent a total of 22 treatment sessions (3-4 sessions per patient); treatment responses were evaluated clinically, and lesion size was determined using computed tomography (CT). Over 10-26 months of follow-up, tumor sizes and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of all patients were decreased. No patients had complications during the follow-up period. Preliminary results showed that PIIT with pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion under fluoroscopic guidance is effective and safe and may be considered as a treatment option.
