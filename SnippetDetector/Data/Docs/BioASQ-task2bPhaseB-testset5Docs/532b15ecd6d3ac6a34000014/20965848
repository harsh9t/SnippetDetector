OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous intratumor injection of pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion (PLE) in the management of recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. METHODS: Seven patients with recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas presenting with severe local pain with visual analogue score (VAS)â‰¥8 received treatment sessions of fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous intratumor injection of PLE. The patients were followed up every 3 months after the last session to assess their clinical responses and observe the changes in the tumor size measured by computed tomography. The changes in the VAS, tumor necrosis and pain relief as well as the adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 22 sessions of fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous intratumoral PLE injection was performed in these cases (3 or 4 sessions in each case). The total average pingyangmycin dose delivered was 48.0 mg and the average lipiodol dose was 40.0 ml in each case. Five patients showed low fever and vomiting 48 after the injection. During the follow-up (median time of 21.7 months, range 10-26 months), all the patients showed obviously reduced tumor size and VAS, and partial remission was achieved in 6 patients and stable disease (SD) in 1 patient. None of the patients had complications during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous intratumoral injection of PLE can be effective and safe and may serve as a alternative for treatment of recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas.
