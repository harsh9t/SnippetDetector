Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a recently delineated severe mental retardation, multiple congenital anomalies syndrome caused by dominant nonsense or frameshift mutations, deletions or translocations of the zinc finger homeobox 1B gene (ZFHX1B). We report on a patient with exceptional mild phenotype caused by a novel and unusual splice mutation in the 5'UTR. The aberrant transcript leads to usage of an alternative upstream start codon. The resulting protein differs from the wild-type only in the first 24 amino acids. The aberrant protein therefore contains all known functional domains, but might lack a so far unrecognized putative N-terminal acylation site, which is probably important for neuronal function and facial structures.
