We present a clinical case of a female infant with multiple anomalies and distinctive facial features, with an exceptionally severe clinical course of Hirschsprung disease. The girl was also diagnosed with Mowat-Wilson syndrome, confirmed by molecular analysis as a heterozygous deletion of the ZEB2 gene. Moreover, molecular karyotyping revealed a deletion involving further genes (KYNU, ARHGAP15, and GTDC1).
