Aminoglycosides can bypass nonsense mutations and are the prototypic agents for translational bypass therapy (TBT). Initial results demonstrate the need for more potent drugs and an in vivo model system for quantitative assessment of TBT. Herein, we present an in vivo system for evaluating the efficacy of premature stop codon management therapies: in vivo quantitative stop codon management repli-sampling TBT efficacy assay (IQSCMaRTEA). Application of IQSCMaRTEA reveals that geneticin is much more efficacious in vivo than gentamicin. Treatment with geneticin elicits a multiday response, and residual F9 antigen can be detected after 3 weeks. These data demonstrate the utility of IQSCMaRTEA for evaluating drugs that bypass nonsense mutations. In addition, IQSCMaRTEA may be helpful for testing inhibitors of nonsense-mediated decay, as stop codon management therapy will sometimes require inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay and translational bypass of the nonsense mutation. Furthermore, geneticin, its metabolites, or better tolerated analogues should be evaluated as a general treatment with multiday response for severe genetic disease caused by nonsense mutation.
