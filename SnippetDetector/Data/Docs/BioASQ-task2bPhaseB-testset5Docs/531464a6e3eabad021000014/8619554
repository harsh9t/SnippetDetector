McLeod syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder, characterized by neuromuscular and hematopoietic dysfunction. Two cases of McLeod syndrome were reported in a family with neuroacanthocytosis and, remarkably, 1 of them was female. Direct sequence analysis of the McLeod gene in 12 members of the family revealed a novel point mutation in exon 2 that creates a frameshift and results in premature termination of translation. There was marked skewing of X inactivation in the severely affected female.
