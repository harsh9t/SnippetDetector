We report the first case of McLeod syndrome (MLS) in a 47-year-old Chinese man who presented with progressive limb weakness, chorea of feet, red blood cell acanthocytosis, absence of Kx red blood cell antigen and weak expression of Kell antigens. The diagnosis of MLS was confirmed by genetic testing showing a hemizygous mutation of XK gene. We review literature on neuroacanthocytosis in the Chinese population.
