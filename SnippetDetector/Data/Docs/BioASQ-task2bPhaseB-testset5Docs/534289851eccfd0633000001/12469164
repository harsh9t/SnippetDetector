<abstract>
Amifostine has shown to selectively protect normal tissues against cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of several anti-neoplastic drugs, such as alkylating agents, organoplatinum compounds, anthracyclines, taxanes, and ionising radiation. This cytoprotection is broad-spectrum and selective, without loss of therapeutic efficacy. In this study we have treated 31 patients affected with inoperable or metastatic breast cancer, not previously submitted to chemotherapy for advanced disease, with amifostine 910 mg/m(2) followed by doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2). The overall response rate was 52% with a median response duration of 13 months (range 6-53+) and a median overall survival of 21 months (range 3-59+). With regard to toxicity, 14 patients (45%) experienced transient g4 neutropenia which was febrile only in one case (3%). Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was not recorded. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 14% of cycles. Grade 3 mucositis was observed in only 1 patient, whereas 2 patients (6%) developed an asymptomatic drop of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >10% below basal value. In conclusion, this study suggests that amifostine can reduce doxorubicin related toxicity, thus improving the patients' quality of life and the efficacy/toxicity ratio of this drug.
