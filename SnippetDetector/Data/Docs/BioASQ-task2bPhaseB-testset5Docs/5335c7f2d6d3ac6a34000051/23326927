BACKGROUND: A new mechanism of action in the form of sodium-glucose co-transporter-(SGLT-)2 inhibitors will be available shortly for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. METHOD: Overview. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Fasting and postprandial blood glucose and HbA(1c) concentrations are indirectly reduced by the inhibition of glucose reabsorption and increased glycosuria. SGLT-2 inhibitors also have a positive impact on body weight and blood pressure of type 2 diabetics. In the available registration trials conducted to date, the SGLT-2 inhibitors appeared overall as a safe class of drugs. The clinical importance of an increased incidence of genital infections--in particular in special patientpopulations--requires further clarification. Long-term trials are currently underway to verify safety and in particular cardiovascular effects of this drug class.
