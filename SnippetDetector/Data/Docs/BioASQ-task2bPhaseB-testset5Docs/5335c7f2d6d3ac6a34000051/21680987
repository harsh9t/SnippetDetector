Hyperglycemia is a defining characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is a major risk factor associated with the development of many microvascular complications. There are numerous therapies currently available to treat hyperglycemia, but glycemic control rates remain poor. One potential reason is the decline in ÃŸ-cell function over time, which decreases the effectiveness of therapies that rely on insulin action. The kidney occupies a central position in the control of glucose homeostasis by its role in gluconeogenesis and by regulating glucose excretion. Under normal conditions, glucose filtered by the kidney is virtually totally reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). Inhibition of SGLT2 is an attractive, insulin-independent target for increasing glucose excretion in the setting of hyperglycemia. A number of SGLT2 inhibitors have been synthesized, and results from preclinical studies have shown that they increase glucose excretion and normalize plasma glucose in diabetic models. Initial clinical data are promising and suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may be a new therapeutic option for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus.
