Canagliflozin (Invokanaâ„¢), an oral selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is under global development with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 are mainly located in the proximal tubule of the kidney and are involved in the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the glomeruli into the body. Inhibition of SGLT2 lowers blood glucose in an insulin independent manner as a consequence of blocking reabsorption of filtered glucose in the glomeruli, thereby increasing urinary excretion of glucose and, in turn, potentially reducing bodyweight. Canagliflozin is the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved in the USA and is under regulatory review in the EU. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of canagliflozin, leading to its first approval for use in adults with type 2 diabetes.
