Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLTs) have a key role in the re-absorption of glucose in the kidneys. Therefore, inhibition of SGLTs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 inhibitors enhance renal glucose excretion by inhibiting renal glucose re-absorption and reduce plasma glucose level, as well as they decrease the body weight. Their action is insulin independent and they improve insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus. Numerous SGLT2 inhibitors have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials. Phase III trials are needed to assess the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors. Results suggest that the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition might be achieved without the development of significant side effects.
