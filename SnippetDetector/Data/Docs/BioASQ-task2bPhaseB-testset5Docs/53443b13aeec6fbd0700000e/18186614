We demonstrate the use of surface-immobilized, oriented peptide aptamers for the detection of specific target proteins from complex biological solutions. These peptide aptamers are target-specific peptides expressed within a protein scaffold engineered from the human protease inhibitor stefin A. The scaffold provides stability to the inserted peptides and increases their binding affinity owing to the resulting three-dimensional constraints. A unique cysteine residue was introduced into the protein scaffold to allow orientation-specific surface immobilization of the peptide aptamer and to ensure exposure of the binding site to the target solution. Using dual-polarization interferometry, we demonstrate a strong relationship between binding affinity and aptamer orientation and determine the affinity constant KD for the interaction between an oriented peptide aptamer ST(cys+)_(pep9) and the target protein CDK2. Further, we demonstrate the high selectivity of the peptide aptamer STM_(pep9) by exposing surface-immobilized ST(cys+)_(pep9) to a complex biological solution containing small concentrations of the target protein CDK2.
