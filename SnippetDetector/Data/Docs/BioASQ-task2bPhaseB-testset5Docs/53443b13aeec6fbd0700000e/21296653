The eukaryotic DNA recombination repair protein BRCA2 is functional in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. The mechanism of the involvement of BRCA2 in homologous recombination includes its interaction with the DNA recombinase proteins of the RAD51 family. BRCA2 is known to interact with RAD51 through its unique and essential BRC sequence motifs. T. brucei BRCA2 homolog (TbBRCA2) has fifteen repeating BRC motifs as compared to mammalian BRCA2 that has only eight. We report here our yeast 2-hybrid analysis studies on the interactions of TbBRCA2 BRC motifs with five different RAD51 paralogues of T. brucei. Our study revealed that a single BRC motif is sufficient to bind to these RAD51 paralogues. To test the possibility whether a single 44 amino acid long repeating unit of the TbBRCA2 BRC motif may be exploited as an inhibitor of T. brucei growth, we ectopically expressed this peptide segment in the procyclic form of the parasite and evaluated its effects on cell survival as well as the sensitivity of these cells to the DNA damaging agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). Expression of a single BRC motif led to MMS sensitivity and inhibited cellular proliferation in T. brucei.
