<abstract>
In eukaryotic cells, there is evidence for functional coupling between transcription and processing of pre-mRNAs. To better understand this coupling, we performed a high-resolution kinetic analysis of transcription and splicing in budding yeast. This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, RNA polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced mRNA and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes. We propose that transcriptional pausing is imposed by a checkpoint associated with cotranscriptional splicing.

Introduction
ost transcripts produced by eukaryotic  polymerase  () undergo processing at their 5β€² ends (capping), 3β€² ends (cleavage and polyadenylation), and internally (splicing to remove introns). t is now widely accepted that many of these modifications, especially capping and 3β€² end formation, occur cotranscriptionally, that is, before transcription is completed and the  is released from the site of transcription (andit et. Β al., 2008; Perales and Bentley 2009). Splicing can occur co- or posttranscriptionally. For example, early electron micrographs of Drosophila cells showed that many but not all introns are removed cotranscriptionally (Beyer and Osheim, 1988). The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method has been used to demonstrate the sequential recruitment of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) to the site of transcription, indicating spliceosome assembly on nascent transcripts in both yeast and mammalian cells (GΓ¶rnemann etΒ al., 2005; Lacadie and Rosbash, 2005; Listerman etΒ al., 2006; Tardiff etΒ al., 2006; Moore etΒ al., 2006). The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII large subunit binds a number of RNA processing factors, including capping enzymes, certain splicing factors, and 3β€² end processing factors (Buratowski, 2009). Thus, one explanation for the occurrence of cotranscriptional RNA processing could be that it is simply a consequence of the cotranscriptional recruitment of the factors involved. However, there is evidence, at least in mammalian systems, that coupling between the different processes is functionally important (Kornblihtt etΒ al., 2004; Neugebauer, 2006; Pandit etΒ al., 2008; Perales and Bentley, 2009).
The CTD consists of multiple repeats (52 in mammals and 26 in budding yeast) of the heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS that is dynamically phosphorylated during cycles of transcription (Buratowski, 2009). Typically, the CTD is in a hypophosphorylated form at the promoter. At initiation of transcription, the serine at position 5 (Ser5) becomes phosphorylated to permit promoter clearance. This also promotes recruitment of the capping enzymes. As RNAPII elongates toward the 3β€² end of the gene, Ser5 phosphorylation declines and there is increased phosphorylation of Ser2, which promotes recruitment of the 3β€² end processing factors (Licatalosi etΒ al., 2002). Recently, Ser7 in the CTD was found to be phosphorylated in a manner resembling that of Ser5 (Egloff etΒ al., 2007; Kim etΒ al., 2009), in addition to which, promoter-distal phosphorylated Ser7 (pSer7) was found on genes transcribed by RNAPII (Tietjen etΒ al., 2010). Currently, the only characterized function for pSer7 is related to 3β€² end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Egloff etΒ al., 2007). Therefore, the CTD was proposed to function as a β€�landing padβ€� for the recruitment of RNA processing factors, with the specificity being determined by a β€�CTD codeβ€� of posttranslational modifications (Egloff and Murphy, 2008). Furthermore, the dynamic phosphorylation state of RNAPII is thought to play an important role in the regulation of splicing (BatschΓ© etΒ al., 2006; Kornblihtt, 2006; Pandit etΒ al., 2008).
Changing the dynamics of transcript elongation can also influence downstream processing events and can affect constitutive or alternative splicing (Kadener etΒ al., 2001; Nogues etΒ al., 2002; de la Mata etΒ al., 2003; Howe etΒ al., 2003). It was proposed that the rate of transcriptional elongation can affect inclusion or skipping of an alternative exon by controlling the duration of a β€�window of opportunityβ€� during which the splicing machinery can recognize an upstream splice site and assemble a spliceosome before the appearance of a competing downstream splice site (Kornblihtt etΒ al., 2004; Perales and Bentley, 2009). Conversely, splicing signals and splicing factors can enhance transcriptional activity (Furger etΒ al., 2002; Damgaard etΒ al., 2008; Lin etΒ al., 2008), suggesting reciprocal interactions.
Here, we present high-resolution kinetic analyses of transcription and splicing, using a series of reporter genes in budding yeast. We demonstrate repeated splicing-dependent transcriptional pausing at the 3β€² end of the introns in two different reporter genes. The CTD of the paused polymerase is hyperphosphorylated on Ser5 compared to its status at the promoter, and it becomes phosphorylated on Ser2 at this point. We also demonstrate elevated levels of phosphorylated RNAPII over the 3β€² splice sites of several endogenous yeast genes, suggesting that this is a general phenomenon. We propose that transcriptional pausing is imposed by a checkpoint that is associated with cotranscriptional splicing. We discuss candidate proteins that might function as checkpoint factors and speculate that multiple checkpoints may exist that correspond to surveillance mechanisms operating at different stages of the splicing process.

Results
o follow the in. Β vivo kinetics of pre-mRNA splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we integrated reporters based on hybrid ACT1-PGK1 sequences (Hilleren and Parker 2003; Alexander etΒ al., 2010) into the genome at the HIS3 locus under either tetracycline-inducible (tetON) or tetracycline-repressible (tetOFF) control (BellΓ­ etΒ al., 1998). Both the tetON and tetOFF strains express tetracycline-responsive repressor and tetracycline-responsive transactivator proteins, which provides a good dynamic range of gene expression (BellΓ­ etΒ al. [1998]; in this work, the tetracycline analog doxycyclin was used). The 1.3 kb Ribo1 gene (FigureΒ 1A; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online for full details) contains the budding yeast ACT1 intron with a short insertion to allow the transcripts to be distinguished from endogenous ACT1 transcripts in reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assays. Variants of this reporter contain a point mutation at the 5β€² splice site (5β€²SSRibo1), 3β€² splice site (3β€²SSRibo1), or branch site (BSRibo1) or lack an intron (ILRibo1) (Hilleren and Parker 2003; Alexander etΒ al., 2010). Addition of doxycyclin to the growth medium of a tetON Ribo1 strain resulted in the transient low level accumulation of Ribo1 pre-mRNA at about 3 min, followed by spliced Ribo1 mRNA from 4 min, indicating splicing activity (FigureΒ 1B, Ribo1). Similarly, ILRibo1 mRNA was detectable from 3Β min (FigureΒ 1B, ILRibo1).
ChIP assays, using antibodies against the Rpb3p subunit of RNAPII, detected RNAPII recruitment to the promoter region of the Ribo1 and ILRibo1 genes by 3Β min after doxycyclin addition, and the level of RNAPII at the promoter then remained above the uninduced level (FigureΒ 1C; qPCR amplicon 1, indicated in FigureΒ 1A). At 4Β min (when spliced mRNA was first detectable), a strong, transient accumulation of RNAPII was observed around the 3β€²SS and just downstream at the 5β€² end of exon 2 of Ribo1 (amplicons 3 and 4; Figures 1D and 1E; see FigureΒ S1 for the full dataset) but not in the corresponding region of ILRibo1 (amplicon 4; Figures 1D and 1E). Note that the Rpb3p ChIP signal is low over the exon1/5β€²SS region (amplicon 2), showing that RNAPII levels on either side, at the promoter and 3β€²SS, can be distinguished in this assay (Ribo1 in FigureΒ 1E and Figures S1Aβ€“S1C). From 5.5 min, there was also a persistent RNAPII signal toward the 3β€² end of Ribo1 that was consistently higher than the signal at the 3β€² end of ILRibo1, although the latter appeared earlier, from 3Β min (amplicon 5; FigureΒ 1E). These results were highly reproducible and were similar upon derepression of tetOFF strains (data not shown). Although the timing of the first detection of transcripts varied slightly between different cultures, the transient accumulation of RNAPII in the 3β€²SS region always coincided with the appearance of spliced Ribo1 mRNA. In several experiments, two peaks of RNAPII were detected at or near the 3β€² splice site, a few minutes apart (e.g., FigureΒ S1C).
We next tested the effect of point mutations at the 5β€²SS or 3β€²SS (FigureΒ 1A), which abolish the first or second step of splicing, respectively. Unspliced 5β€²SSRibo1 transcripts accumulated from about 3Β min and, as expected, no spliced mRNA was detectable (FigureΒ 1B, 5β€²SSRibo1). 3β€²SSRibo1 RNA is a substrate for the first but not the second step of splicing, and the lariat intron-exon 2 product of the first step accumulated with a delay of about 30Β s after the appearance of pre-mRNA (FigureΒ 1B, 3β€²SSRibo1). ChIP assays showed RNAPII accumulation at the promoter of each mutant reporter gene (FigureΒ 1C), but to a lower level than with the Ribo1 gene, suggesting reduced transcriptional activity, and there was no accumulation of RNAPII around the 3β€²SS (Figures 1D and 1E; amplicons 3 and 4). Thus, the transient RNAPII accumulation around the 3β€²SS region of the Ribo1 gene depends on the presence of a fully functional intron and/or completion of the splicing reaction, and neither spliceosome assembly nor the first step of splicing is sufficient to cause this. However, with the 3β€²SSRibo1 reporter, we observed a persistent accumulation of RNAPII over the exon1/5β€²SS (amplicon 2), suggesting that in the absence of a functional 3β€²SS, there is a change in the dynamics of transcript elongation, with RNAPII slowing its elongation rate or pausing over exon1/5β€²SS.
The phosphorylation status of the CTD was also monitored by ChIP, using antibodies specific for phosphorylated serine 5 (pSer5) or phosphorylated serine 2 (pSer2) (Kim etΒ al., 2009). This showed that, as expected, RNAPII at the promoter of Ribo1 had mainly pSer5 (FigureΒ 2A). The RNAPII that accumulated transiently around the 3β€²SS at 4Β min was also highly phosphorylated on Ser5, and pSer5 RNAPII accumulated transiently at the 3β€²SS again a few minutes later (FigureΒ S2C). Notably, there was little or no pSer5 detected between the promoter and the 3β€²SS (amplicon 2 in FigureΒ 2A, left panel). The paused RNAPII was also phosphorylated on Ser2 (FigureΒ 2A, right panel; FigureΒ S2C), with the 3β€²SS being the most 5β€² position on the gene at which pSer2 was detected. This suggests that phosphorylation of Ser2 occurred on the paused RNAPII; however, the pSer2 accumulation may not display exactly the same timing as the pSer5 data. Toward the 3β€² end of the gene, pSer5 declined, whereas pSer2 increased at later time points. Presenting the RNAPII phosphorylation signal as a proportion of the total RNAPII signal shows that RNAPII at the 3β€²SS was hyperphosphorylated compared to RNAPII at the promoter (FigureΒ S2, pSer5/RNAPII, compare A and C). This suggests new phosphorylation of Ser5 and Ser2 at the 3β€²SS.
With the intronless ILRibo1 reporter, the pSer5 signal simply decreased from the promoter toward the 3β€² end of the gene, as the pSer2 signal gradually increased (FigureΒ 2B). With 5β€²SSRibo1, RNAPII with pSer5 accumulated strongly at the promoter, despite the lower level of total RNAPII signal, and there was only a low level of pSer2 across the body of the gene, more like ILRibo1 than Ribo1 (FigureΒ 2). With 3β€²SSRibo1 (FigureΒ 2D), there was an accumulation of pSer5 at the promoter and also over the exon1/5β€²SS (amplicon 2), compatible with a slowing or pausing of RNAPII in this region. The level of pSer2 increased toward the 3β€² end of the 3β€²SSRibo1 gene. Thus, the dynamics of RNAPII phosphorylation differ significantly with the splicing status of the gene.
If the RNAPII pause in the region of the 3β€²SS is determined by splicing, two predictions can be made: (1) splicing of Ribo1 transcripts should be cotranscriptional at this time and (2) suppression of the splicing defect of a mutant intron will lead to RNAPII pausing on the mutant gene.
To address the first point, we analyzed the cotranscriptional recruitment of U2 and U5 snRNPs by performing ChIP with antibodies to the snRNP components Prp11p and Prp8p, respectively. U2 snRNP was detectable at 3.5Β min after doxycyclin addition, and the U5 snRNP was first detected at 4Β min (FigureΒ 3), consistent with cotranscriptional spliceosome assembly at the time of the RNAPII pause (GΓ¶rnemann etΒ al., 2005) and continuing thereafter. Furthermore, we have recently shown in a kinetic analysis of splicing and 3β€² end formation that a significant amount of splicing of Ribo1 transcripts occurs prior to 3β€² end cleavage and polyadenylation, indicating cotranscriptional splicing (Alexander etΒ al., 2010). It is therefore conceivable that cotranscriptionally recruited splicing factors might affect RNAPII and/or chromatin factors that are in close proximity.
To test the second prediction, we used the BSRibo1 reporter that has a point mutation at the branch site, which causes a first step splicing defect. This splicing defect can be largely suppressed by a mutant U2 snRNA that restores base pairing with the mutant branch site sequence (Parker etΒ al., 1987) (FigureΒ 4A). Plasmids encoding the wild-type or mutant U2 snRNA were introduced into a tetOFF BSRibo1 strain. After derepression in the wild-type U2 control strain, unspliced transcripts accumulated with no detectable splicing (FigureΒ 4B, left panel), and there was no RNAPII accumulation around the 3β€²SS (Figures 4D and 4E; amplicons 3 and 4). This resembles the ILRibo1 and 5β€²SSRibo1 result (FigureΒ 1D). In a strain producing mutant U2 snRNA that complements the BSRibo1 mutation, splicing was substantially restored (FigureΒ 4B, right panel). Importantly, RNAPII accumulated transiently at the 3β€²SS at 6.5 min, the time when spliced mRNA was first detected, and a second peak of RNAPII appeared at the 3β€²SS at 8.5Β min (FigureΒ 4D right panel; see FigureΒ S3 for more detail and ChIP data for pSer5 and pSer2). Thus, it is clearly the actual process of splicing, rather than the intron sequence, that causes transient RNAPII pausing. Additionally, it may be significant that suppression of the BS splicing defect also resulted in higher levels of pSer2 RNAPII toward the 3β€² end of exon 2 (amplicon 5; FigureΒ 4E and FigureΒ S3E) as was noted earlier for Ribo1, suggesting that this too may be splicing dependent.
The observation of a second RNAPII pause in several experiments raised the possibility that pausing may be a recurring event. To test this, we performed a longer time course of Ribo1 induction, and, indeed, RNAPII was observed to accumulate strongly near the 3β€²SS three times, at approximately 3Β min intervals (FigureΒ 5 and FigureΒ S4). Intriguingly, each RNAPII pause seems to occur at or shortly after a peak in pre-mRNA accumulation and increased mRNA production, suggesting bursts of splicing at these times.
The majority of intron-containing genes are constitutively expressed during normal growth in budding yeast. Therefore, in order to examine another intron-containing gene under similar induction conditions, the nonessential APE2 gene was deleted from its genomic locus in the tetON yeast strain, and the APE2 sequence, was integrated downstream of the doxycyclin-inducible promoter at the HIS3 locus (like Ribo1). An advantage of APE2 for this analysis is that both of its exons are longer than for Ribo1, allowing qPCR analysis of more, nonoverlapping, regions of the APE2 gene. After the addition of doxycyclin, RNAPII occupancy on the gene was monitored as for Ribo1. As shown in FigureΒ 6C, oscillations of RNAPII accumulation were observed in the region of the 3β€²SS, with a periodicity of 2.5 to 3 min. There was also increased RNAPII accumulation toward the 3β€² end of the gene (FigureΒ 6C, and more detail in FigureΒ S5). Analysis of the phosphorylation status showed RNAPII with pSer5 in the promoter region and in the transient peaks over the 3β€²SS (FigureΒ 6 and FigureΒ S5). The pSer2 signal also increased from this point toward the 3β€² end of the gene. Therefore, the APE2 and Ribo1 genes show similar patterns of RNAPII accumulation after induction.
Although RNAPII pauses only very briefly at the end of the Ribo1 and APE2 introns, the observation that pausing occurs repeatedly suggested that it may be possible to detect an elevated level of RNAPII over 3β€² splice sites of constitutively expressed endogenous genes, without inducing synchronous transcription in the population of cells. However, with an asynchronous population of cells, the length, amplitude, and frequency of the pause or oscillation will determine how readily an elevated level of RNAPII will be detectable above background in the snapshot in time that is captured by the ChIP assay. Clearly, this may vary between genes. ChIP of RNAPII performed on four endogenous intron-containing genes, including APE2, shows that the level of RNAPII is slightly elevated over the 3β€²SS of all four genes, although the resolution is poor (FigureΒ S6). As it had been shown that the level of phosphorylation of RNAPII is significantly elevated around the 3β€²SS of Ribo1 (FigureΒ 2) and APE2 (FigureΒ 6), the amount of phosphorylated RNAPII was measured. Indeed, coincident peaks of enrichment of RNAPII with pSer5 and pSer2 are evident over the 3β€² splice sites of all four intron-containing genes (Figures 7Aβ€“7D). It is particularly clear for APE2 and DBP2, which have longer first exons, that the peak of pSer5 at the 3β€²SS is distinct from the peak at the promoter. In contrast, different patterns were observed for two intronless genes, ADH1 and FMP27, with pSer5 declining and pSer2 increasing from the 5β€² ends to the 3β€² ends of the genes (Figures 7E and 7F).

Discussion
he splicing-dependent transient accumulation of  was first detected in these experiments because we performed high-resolution time series analyses during the early stages of induction of an intron-containing gene. he detection of repeated pausing events lasting probably no more than 30 s each (igures 5 and 6) indicates that  initiation and elongation on the doxycyclin-regulated ibo1 and 2 genes are highly synchronous in different cells in the population, at least for the duration of these experiments. n principle, the accumulated  signal could represent sites of  arrest and premature transcription termination. owever, the amount of ibo1 m. RNA increased very rapidly and more or less continuously, usually reaching a level as high or higher than for ILRibo1. Thus, there was no evidence of a defect in transcription and we propose that RNAPII pauses at a splicing-dependent transcriptional checkpoint.
The timing of the first observed pause after induction of the Ribo1 gene correlates with the first detectable cotranscriptional splicing event, as judged by the cotranscriptional recruitment of U2 and U5 snRNPs (FigureΒ 3) and accumulation of spliced mRNA (FigureΒ 1B shows RNA accumulation in the same culture). Furthermore, in a longer experiment (FigureΒ 5), three large peaks of RNAPII also occurred at or immediately after peaks in pre-mRNA accumulation and rapid rises in mRNA production, which we propose may represent bursts of splicing activity. ChIP of RNAPII at the promoter may also suggest bursts of transcriptional activity (FigureΒ 5C), although the periodicity differs from that of splicing and RNAPII pausing. Synchronous bursts of transcription have been observed after induction of mammalian genes although with longer intervals than observed here (MΓ©tivier etΒ al., 2008; Heim etΒ al., 2009).
The ChIP assays with Ribo1 indicate transient accumulation of RNAPII associated with amplicons 3 and 4 that span 180Β bp around the 3β€²SS of Ribo1 (40Β bp at the 3β€² end of the intron and 140Β bp at the 5β€² end of exon2). Although amplicons 3 and 4 have overlapping sequences, they do provide some discrimination, as seen by the detection of U2 snRNP recruitment only with amplicon 3, and of U5 snRNP recruitment only with amplicon 4 (Figures 3C and 3D). Therefore, RNAPII may accumulate over a large area around the 3β€²SS and downstream. Our data suggest that the RNAPII pausing at the 3β€² end of introns is unlikely to be sequence specific (discussed below); therefore, it may occur wherever RNAPII happens to be on the gene at the time when a checkpoint is triggered by the spliceosome, and this may vary slightly between cells in a population. In order to explore this issue further, a method with higher resolution than ChIP-PCR will be required. Although the available genome-wide data lack the resolution and sensitivity to show a transient accumulation of RNAPII over 3β€² splice sites, RNAPII was found to accumulate over internal exons in humans as well as plants, Drosophila and nematodes (Brodsky etΒ al., 2005; Schwartz etΒ al., 2009; Chodavarapu etΒ al., 2010), and especially over alternatively spliced exons in humans (Brodsky etΒ al., 2005). As exons in higher eukaryotes tend to be short, these observations could be explained by the accumulation of RNAPII near the 3β€² splice sites.
The APE2 and Ribo1 genes showed similar patterns of RNAPII phosphorylation after induction, with pSer5 RNAPII at the promoter, oscillating levels of pSer5 RNAPII in the region of the 3β€²SS, and with pSer2 first detected at this point and persistently high toward the 3β€² end of the genes, but not displaying the obvious periodicity seen for pSer5 at the 3β€²SS. Examination of the proportion of total RNAPII that is phosphorylated indicates that RNAPII at the 3β€²SS is hyperphosphorylated compared to RNAPII at the promoter (FigureΒ S2). Also, particularly for inducible APE2, little or no pSer5 RNAPII was detected between the promoter and 3β€²SS (FigureΒ S5), suggesting that RNAPII at the 3β€²SS is newly phosphorylated. The evidence of hyperphosphorylation of RNAPII over the 3β€² splice sites of constitutively expressed genes in a population of cells growing under steady-state conditions suggests that this may be a common event in yeast.
The finding of strongly phosphorylated RNAPII paused near the 3β€² ends of the Ribo1 and APE2 introns is compatible with regulated transcription. RNAPII with pSer5 CTD is generally found in the 5β€² region of genes at transcription initiation and is also associated with promoter proximal pausing, whereas pSer2 is associated with elongating RNAPII (Buratowski, 2009). We propose the existence of a transcriptional checkpoint, in which RNAPII pauses transiently near 3β€² splice sites with an associated phosphorylation of Ser5 in the CTD. Conceivably, phosphorylation of Ser2 of the CTD at the same position on the gene may be associated with release from the proposed checkpoint.
pSer5 is not commonly found within the body of a gene, but it is not unknown. For example, hyperphosphorylation of RNAPII and inhibition of transcriptional elongation was observed after ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that causes changes to cotranscriptional alternative splicing in mammalian cells (MuΓ±oz etΒ al., 2009). Also, human Brm, the ATPase component of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, affects the alternative splicing of a number of transcripts, apparently by inducing the accumulation of RNAPII with pSer5 on the variant exons of affected genes (BatschΓ© etΒ al., 2006). This was proposed to reflect a decreased elongation rate or pausing of RNAPII by Brm that would, in turn, favor inclusion of the variable exons in the mRNA. Thus, Brm was proposed to mediate crosstalk between transcription and RNA processing by directly or indirectly affecting the phosphorylation status of RNAPII (reviewed by Kornblihtt, 2006).
Although mutation of the 5β€²SS, BS, or 3β€²SS of the Ribo1 reporter intron abolished pausing at the 3β€²SS, pausing was restored by suppression in trans of the splicing defect of the BSRibo1 mutant transcript. Thus, it seems to be the splicing event rather than the sequence of the intron that actually triggers RNAPII pausing. The failure of 3β€²SSRibo1 mutant to cause this pause suggests that it may be triggered as a consequence of the assembly of spliceosomes that are competent to perform the second step of splicing (or more specifically by the recruitment of a second step splicing factor), and it could be the completion of the second step reaction that releases the pause. Interestingly, with the 3β€²SSRibo1 mutant, there was a pronounced accumulation of pSer5 modified RNAPII on the exon1/5β€²SS region of the gene (FigureΒ 2D, left panel, amplicon 2), and a reduced amount of total RNAPII at the promoter (FiguresΒ 1C and 1E) compared with the splicing-competent Ribo1 gene. We propose that this may indicate the existence of an earlier checkpoint that is triggered by the splicing defect of 3β€²SSRibo1 transcripts, possibly resulting in reduced promoter activity.
As spliceosome assembly takes place cotranscriptionally it seems likely that splicing factors may mediate the RNAPII pause either by direct interaction or via chromatin-associated factors. Many splicing factors have been shown to interact with RNAPII complexes, including yeast Prp40p (Morris and Greenleaf 2000), and human SR proteins and U1 snRNP components (Das etΒ al., 2007). There have been several reports of splicing factors affecting transcription (for reviews, see Fededa and Kornblihtt, 2008; Pandit etΒ al., 2008). For example human U snRNPs were shown to strongly stimulate RNAPII elongation through interaction with the transcription elongation factor TAT-SF1 that, in turn, interacts with elongation factor P-TEFb (Fong and Zhou, 2001). Human SC35 also appears to stimulate transcription through interaction with P-TEFb (Lin etΒ al., 2008). The P-TEFb complex contains the CDK9 kinase that binds to pSer5 and phosphorylates Ser2 of the CTD. Depletion of SC35 caused a transcription elongation defect and RNAPII was observed to accumulate on the body of certain genes, with a concomitant reduction in P-TEFb recruitment and of pSer2. In view of our observations with yeast, we suggest that SC35 depletion may have triggered a transcriptional checkpoint response either directly through lack of interaction of SC35 with P-TEFb, or indirectly by causing a splicing defect at the affected genes.
The human SKIP protein is another factor that was reported to activate transcription through interaction with P-TEFb, in this case enhancing Tat-regulated elongation at the HIV-1 promoter (BrΓ¨s etΒ al., 2005). SKIP (Prp45p in yeast) is both a coregulator of transcription (BrΓ¨s etΒ al., 2005; BrΓ¨s etΒ al., 2009) and an essential component of spliceosomes (Albers etΒ al., 2003; Makarova etΒ al., 2004). SKIP is therefore a candidate coupling or checkpoint factor that could mediate functional links between the two processes. Other candidates are the DExD/H-box RNA helicases, eight of which are involved in splicing in budding yeast. There is evidence that several of these proteins function as splicing fidelity factors, determining whether splicing should proceed to the next stage or the RNA should be discarded (Burgess and Guthrie, 1993; Mayas etΒ al., 2006; Xu and Query, 2007; Query and Konarska, 2006).
A splicing-dependent transcriptional checkpoint might exist at the 3β€² ends of introns simply to promote cotranscriptional splicing or, especially in metazoans, to enhance use of that particular 3β€²SS. Alternatively, multiple transcriptional checkpoints might exist that function as part of a surveillance mechanism in response to signals from fidelity factors at different stages during the splicing cycle, from spliceosome assembly to release of the spliced products. This would suggest a highly complex series of interactions, involving many factors. The system described here, using high-resolution kinetic assays in an organism that is amenable to genetics, provides a means to investigate the mechanism behind the proposed checkpoint(s) and identify the factors involved.

Experimental rocedures
he ibo reporter genes under control of a tet-7/1- promoter (ell. Γ­ etΒ al., 1998) were integrated at the his3 locus in the tetON strain YIK91 or in the tetOFF strain YIK120 (Alexander etΒ al., 2010). The doxycyclin-inducible APE2 gene was constructed in a similar way in the tetON strain. See the Supplemental Information for details of strains (Table S1) and sequences of the Ribo reporter genes. Cultures were grown in synthetic dropout (SD) medium (Foremedium) at 30Β°C and doxycyclin was added to 4 ΞΌg/ml to induce or repress reporter gene expression. For RNA extraction, 10Β ml aliquots of culture were pipetted into 5Β ml of methanol at β�’70Β°C, pelleted, and stored at β�’70Β°C. RNA extraction (Tollervey and Mattaj 1987) and RT-qPCR were performed as described in the Supplementary Experimental Procedures, using primers as in Table S2. For ChIP analysis, 40Β ml aliquots of culture were crosslinked for 10Β min with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde and treated as described at http://www.ribosys.org/, using antibodies against Rpb3p (Neoclone), 4H8 antibodies (Millipore), or H5 antibodies (Covance). The DNA fragments (average size 350Β bp) were amplified by qPCR using primers listed in Tables S2 and S3. ChIP experiments to detect phosphorylated RNAPII epitopes were performed at sub-saturating antibody titers (5-fold less than recommended by Kim etΒ al. [2009]). ChIP data for the kinetic experiments are presented as percentage of input relative to uninduced level at T0. ChIP data for pSer RNAPII in FigureΒ 7 and FigureΒ S2 (right panels) are presented as the percentage of input relative to total RNAPII. Experiments presented in Figures 5 and 6 were performed in biological duplicate, and all other experiments were performed at least in triplicate, with all qPCR assays also performed in triplicate. In each case, a representative experiment is shown.
