A 2.5-year-old girl who presented with abdominal distension, hepatomegaly, coarse facies, hirsutism and contraction deformities was investigated for mucopolysaccharidoses. Urinary excretion showed increased total glycosaminoglycans (105 mg/mmol creatinine; normal for age 9-20 mg/mmol) with marked increases of dermatan and heparan sulphates. A number of lysosomal enzyme activities were measured on leucocytes, serum and cultured fibroblasts. Normal or high activities were found for alpha-iduronidase, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase, beta-galactosidase, arylsulphatase B and beta-glucuronidase. However a marked deficiency of iduronate sulphate sulphatase activity was observed, consistent with a diagnosis of Hunter's disease. Activities were reduced to less than 2% of mean control values in the patient's leucocytes, serum and cultured fibroblasts. Normal activities were measured in samples from the father and younger sister but a partial deficiency (43% of control serum) was found in the mother. Chromosome studies on the patient revealed a partial deletion of the long arm of one X-chromosome, most probably of band Xq25, which was not inherited from either parent. Studies using BrdU indicated that the deleted X chromosome was consistently late replicating, and as a result the Hunter gene was fully expressed on the other X chromosome.
