Hunter disease, an X-linked recessive lethal, has recently been observed to occur in high frequency in Israeli Jews as compared with other Caucasian populations. Using the equilibrium distribution of the number of affected males, one can computed the probability that the excess frequency is due to genetic drift. Our results demonstrate that the elevated frequency of Hunter disease is compatible with drift.
