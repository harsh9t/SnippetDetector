Parkinson disease is characterized by the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein as the major component of the Lewy bodies. α-Synuclein accumulation in turn leads to compensatory effects that may include the up-regulation of autophagy. Another common feature of Parkinson disease (PD) is mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we provide evidence that the overactivation of autophagy may be a link that connects the intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein with mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that the activation of macroautophagy in primary cortical neurons that overexpress mutant A53T α-synuclein leads to massive mitochondrial destruction and loss, which is associated with a bioenergetic deficit and neuronal degeneration. No mitochondrial removal or net loss was observed when we suppressed the targeting of mitochondria to autophagosomes by silencing Parkin, overexpressing wild-type Mitofusin 2 and dominant negative Dynamin-related protein 1 or blocking autophagy by silencing autophagy-related genes. The inhibition of targeting mitochondria to autophagosomes or autophagy was also partially protective against mutant A53T α-synuclein-induced neuronal cell death. These data suggest that overactivated mitochondrial removal could be one of the contributing factors that leads to the mitochondrial loss observed in PD models.
