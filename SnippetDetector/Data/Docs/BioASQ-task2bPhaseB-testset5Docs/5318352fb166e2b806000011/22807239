BACKGROUND: Mutations in parkin have been associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report on unusual phenotypic variability within a family with mutations in parkin. METHODS: The proband and her parents were clinically assessed. Mutation analysis was performed using genomic DNA and complementary DNA. The protein expression of Parkin and Mitofusin 2 was examined by western blotting. RESULTS: The proband was a compound heterozygote with no detectable Parkin and presented with early-onset PD. The father, a single heterozygote with reduced expression of Parkin, had mild loss of arm swing. The mother, who had only very mild rigidity, was unexpectedly found to be a homozygote with no Parkin expression. The proband, but not the parents, met the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria for PD. Parkin-dependent ubiquitination of Mitofusin 2 was impaired in the mother and the proband. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a homozygous mutation carrier in parkin who had no functional protein and only mild signs of parkinsonism in her seventh decade, whereas her daughter developed typical early-onset PD. This family demonstrates phenotypic variability in parkin-related parkinsonism. Â© 2012 Movement Disorder Society.
