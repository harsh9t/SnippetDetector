Amifostine (WR-2721, Ethyol(TM)) is a chemo-and radioprotective agent which is increasingly used in clinical practice to minimize antitumor therapy-induced toxicities. The key of this property of amifostine is certainly its selective action in terms of differential protection of normal tissue and not of tumor cells. Using HUVEC cells and three different cancer cell lines (A549 non-small cell lung cancer, DND-1A melanoma and HeLa cervical carcinoma) we provide evidence that amifostine could protect normal, and not cancer cells, from cisplatin (CDDP)-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Furthermore, low doses of amifostine, easily attainable in vivo, can protect 50% of normal cells in vitro from CDDP-induced cytotoxicity.
