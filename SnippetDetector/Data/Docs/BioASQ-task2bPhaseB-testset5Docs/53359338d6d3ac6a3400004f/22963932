Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a multi-modal antidepressant in clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of 5 mg vortioxetine compared to placebo after 6 wk of treatment in adults with MDD in an out-patient setting. Adults aged 18-75 yr, with a diagnosis of MDD and a baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score â‰¥30, were randomized to receive either 5 mg vortioxetine or placebo over 6 wk, followed by a 2-wk medication-free discontinuation period. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)-24 total score at week 6 compared to placebo. Additional measures included response and remission rates, Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement scores, HAMD-24 total score in subjects with baseline Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) >19 and MADRS-S total score. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed throughout the study. A total of 600 adults were randomized. There were no significant differences in efficacy measures between subjects in the 5 mg vortioxetine and placebo groups at week 6. HAMD-24 total score in subjects with baseline HAMA >19 in the 5 mg vortioxetine group was improved at weeks 3-6 compared to the placebo group (nominal p value <0.05). The most common AEs for the vortioxetine and placebo groups were nausea (19.1 and 9.4%), headache (17.1 and 15.1%) and diarrhoea (11.4 and 7.0%), respectively. In this study of adults with MDD, 5 mg vortioxetine did not differ significantly from placebo in reducing depression symptoms after 6 wk of treatment.
