<abstract>
Slug, a member of the Snail family of transcription factors, has a crucial role in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing several epithelial markers and adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin. A recent study demonstrated that no relationship exists between Slug and E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer. Another study showed that in malignant mesothelioma effusions Slug was associated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, but that there was no association with E-cadherin. F-ascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. In this study, we investigated Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 expression using immunohistochemistry in 60 patients with pancreatic cancer and their correlation with carcinoma invasion and metastasis. Additionally, we observed the effects of Slug on invasion and metastasis in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. Alterations in Slug, MMP-9, and E-cadherin were determined by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Alterations in MMP-9 and F-actin cytoskeleton were determined by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry (FCM), or gelatin zymography. Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 expression in pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with lymph node metastases and we found a significant correlation between Slug and MMP-9 expression; however, no significant correlation was observed between Slug and E-cadherin expression. Slug transfection significantly increased invasion and metastasis in PANC-1 cells and orthotopic tumor of mouse in vivo, and significantly upregulated and activated MMP-9; however, there was no effect on E-cadherin expression. Slug promoted the formation of lamelliopodia or filopodia in PANC-1 cells. The intracellular F-actin and MMP-9 was increased and relocated to the front of the extending pseudopodia from the perinuclear pool in Slug-transfected PANC-1 cells. These results suggest that Slug promotes migration and invasion of PANC-1 cells, which may correlate with the reorganization of MMP-9 and remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton, but not with E-cadherin expression.

The genetic aberration of -cadherin is a rare event in sporadic carcinomas, and transcription repressors are considered to take a central role in -cadherin loss. owever, the relationship between lug transcription, nail transcription, and -cadherin is largely dependent on tissue and cell type.13, 14 n pancreatic cancer, the expression of nail and lug showed that pancreatic cancer cells with high nail expression had no or only low -cadherin expression. n contrast, cells with low nail expression had high expression levels of -cadherin, however, lug expression exhibited no systematic relationship to the expression levels of -cadherin.15 n malignant mesothelial cells, nail, lug and ip1 levels did not exhibit an inverse association with -cadherin levels.16 owever, ictoria ol. Γ³s et al14 have reported that stable expression of Slug in MDCK cells leads to the repression of E-cadherin at the transcriptional level and triggers a complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

In addition to -cadherin, nail and lug can induce the expression of genes associated with a mesenchymal and invasive phenotype, such as fibronectin and matrix metalloproteinase ().16 oseph et al17 have reported that induction of lug in 1 cells did not repress -cadherin levels or regulate individual movement of 1 cells. nstead, lug enhanced cohort migration and atrigel invasion by 1 cells, and additionally lug increased -9 levels, and -9-specific si. RNA blocked Slug-induced Matrigel invasion.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma () is known for its aggressive growth, characterised by early tissue invasion and metastasis.18 tatistical analysis has revealed a relationship between tumor -9 expression with lymph node involvement and occurrence of distant metastases in .19 oorstra et al20 found that invasion and migration in pancreatic cancer was highly related to the transcript level of the -associated transcription factors lug, nail, wist, and -9 m. RNA levels. Slug expression showed no systematic relationship to the expression levels of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer tissue,15 but in mouse skin carcinoma cell lines, Slug and Snail collaborate on tumor growth and metastasis properties by E-cadherin repression, Slug or Snail alone can decrease these properties.21 In this study, we aimed to examine the expression of Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer and to obtain further insight into the question of whether Slug promotes E-cadherin or MMP-9-induced EMT in pancreatic cancer.

atients and issue amples. Between 1999 and 2009, 60 consecutive pancreatic adenocarcinoma (ordinary ductal carcinoma) specimens for which tissue was available for immunohistochemical staining were identified from the files of General Surgery, the affiliated hospital of medical college, Qingdao University. The principally clinical information, such as pathology, was collected from the hospital charts. All research involving human participants was approved in written form by the patients studied and the ethics committee at the affiliated hospital of medical college, Qingdao University.ImmunohistochemistryFour-micron thick paraffin-embedded sections were cut, removed from paraffin with xylene, and rehydrated in descending dilutions of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 30β€‰min of incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase in absolute methanol. Tissue slides were immunohistochemically stained for Slug (dilution at 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or E-cadherin (dilution at 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or MMP-9 (dilution at 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The samples were digested with 0.01% saponin before incubation with the primary MMP-9 antibody or Slug antibody or E-cadherin antibody for 30β€‰min. Background staining was minimized by pre-incubation with 1% normal goat serum for 10β€‰min. The sections were incubated with the primary MMP-9 antibody (Slug antibody or E-cadherin antibody) at 4Β°C overnight. This was followed by the avidin-biotin procedure with a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan).For Slug expression in PANC-1 cells, Slug-transfected or mock-transfected or untreated PANC-1 cells were plated at a density of 5 Γ— 104/mm2 in culture dishes for 24β€‰h. After incubation, dishes were washed twice with cold saline. Subsequently, the cells in the dishes were fixed in 0.3β€‰mol/l NaCl in 70% ethanol for 30β€‰min. The fixed cells were lysed in 0.12β€‰N HCl in 70% ethanol for 10β€‰min and washed with PBS for 5β€‰min three times. The cells were incubated with 1% normal horse serum in PBS for 30β€‰min at room temperature. After washes with PBS for 5β€‰min, Slug antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the primary antibody, followed by the rabbit ABC staining system. Slug-positive cells were counted by light microscopy at Γ— 200 magnification and expressed as the number of positive cells per 1000 cancer cells.Evaluation of Immunohistochemistry ResultsThe results of the immunohistochemical stainings were evaluated by the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cells. Expression of Slug or MMP-9 was determined as positive when cytoplasmic and/or perinuclear staining was seen in more than 10% of the tumor cells. Expression of Slug was considered negative when no cells or less than 10% of the tumor cells were stained.10, 22 Expression of E-cadherin was determined as described in a previous study.23 Briefly, the tumor cells that stained as strongly as normal epithelial cells were considered to be β€�preserved expression' (positive), and those which exhibited weaker staining than normal epithelial cells or showed completely negative staining were considered to be β€�reduced expression' (negative).Cell Culture and Stable Transfection of PANC-1 CellsThe source of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell lines used in this study has been described recently.15 The PANC-1 cell line used in present study was obtained from ATCC, and maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37Β°C in RPMI 1640/Ham's F-12 mixed (1:1) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human full-long Slug cDNA was prepared by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed products of total RNA from PANC-1 cells, using the specific primers (5β€²-GGATTCCTCCATTTCCTAAACCTGGTAGTC-3β€² and 5β€²-GGATTCGTACTTGCCAGCGGGTCTGGC-3β€²) and LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara). The human slug cDNA was then inserted into the pcDNA3 vector to produce pcDNA3β€“Slug cDNA. The PANC-1 cells were transfected with 3β€‰ΞΌg of pcDNA3β€“Slug cDNA or control pcDNA3 vector as recently described24 using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Gibco BRL). Transient Slug cDNA transfection was obtained in PANC-1 cells, with 2β€‰ΞΌg of plasmid and Lipofectamine reagent in OptiMEM serum-free medium and expression was screened after 24β€“48β€‰h. Transfection efficiencies were initially optimized with pcDNA3-GFP plasmid (SinoGenoMax Co., Ltd., China). Stable transfectants were generated after selection with 600β€‰ΞΌg/ml G418 over a period of 4 weeks. Cells were routinely maintained in selection media containing 200β€‰ΞΌg/ml of G418-sulfate to avoid overgrowth of non-transfected cells.Evaluation of Transfection EfficienciesAfter transient transfection for 48β€‰h, the proportion of EGFP-expressing cells was measured by flow cytometry according to the manufacturer's instruction, giving transfection efficiency.BB94 TreatmentPANC-1 cells and stable transfectants were trypsinized, resuspended in culture medium, and plated at 5 Γ— 105 cells on tissue culture chamber slides. A specific MMPs inhibitor (0.1β€‰ΞΌmol/l) was added into the cells.25 After 24β€‰h incubation, the medium was removed. The cell lysates above were collected and further analyzed as described below.RNA Extraction and RT-PCR AnalysisThe mRNA extraction and RT reaction for synthesizing the first-strand cDNA was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer sequences were as follows: Slug: sense: 5β€²-CCTCCAAAAAGCCAAACTACTA-3β€², antisense: 3β€²-GTGTGCTACACAGCAGCC-5β€² E-cadherin: sense: 5β€²-TTCAGTTCCGAGGTCTACAC-3β€² antisense: 3β€²-GTCTCTGTGGTGATGCCGGT-5β€² MMP-9: sense: 5β€²-CCTTCTACGGCCACTACT-3β€², antisense: 3β€²-GCACTGCAGGATGTCATA-5β€² GAPDH: sense: 5β€²-TGATGGGTGTGAACCACGAG-3β€², antisense: 3β€²-TTGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACC-5β€². Fluorescent bands were visualized using a UV-CCD video system (EpiLightUVFA1100; AISIN COSMOS, Tokyo, Japan) and were analyzed using Quantity One image-analysis software (PDI, NY). The intensity of each band relative to the GAPDH band was represented as the meanΒ±s.d. The significance of differences found between the control group and Slug cDNA-treated group was evaluated with Student's t-test. The meanΒ±s.d. values are shown in the figures. P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Quantitative Real-Time PCRThe total cellular RNA from various PANC-1 samples was extracted and purified from the samples above using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Q-PCR assays were performed in triplicate, and the mean values were used for calculations of mRNA expression. Relative levels were determined using the 2(β�’Ξ”Ξ”Ct) method.26Western BlottingWhole-cell proteins in various PANC-1 samples were isolated, the lysates centrifuged, and the supernatant collected and stored at β�’70Β°C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was measured at OD595 with the use of the Bradford assay reagent. In all, 30β€‰ΞΌg of total protein was loaded per well, separated by 7.5β€“12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 150β€‰mA for 16β€‰h at 4Β°C. The membranes were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies. The membranes were rinsed twice with 0.1% Tween 20 PBS for 15β€‰min. The secondary antibodies were used with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000) for 1β€‰h at room temperature. The blotted membranes were washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 PBS for 15β€‰min. The immunoblots were detected by using an electrochemiluminescence kit (Amasham, Piscataway, NJ) and exposed to X-OMAT AR film.Gelatin ZymographyGelatin zymography was performed using a Gelatinzymo electrophoresis kit (Yagai Research Center, Yamagata, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol.ELISA AssayA commercial ELISA kit (Calbiochem) was used to analyze the cellular level of MMP-9. Briefly, an anti-MMP-9 monoclonal antibody was pre-coated onto the 96-well microtiter plate. The second anti-MMP-9 antibody was added to each well. The standard or unknown sample (100β€‰ΞΌl) was then added to the well. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 2β€‰h and the wash was repeated. A substrate solution was then added to all wells and incubated for 30β€‰min. At this point, a stop solution was added to all wells. Color development and intensity of the color were measured using an ELISA plate reader. A standard curve was prepared, plotting the absorbance vs the concentration of the cytokine expressed as picogram per milliliter in the original samples.Flow Cytometry for F-actinCells (1 Γ— 106) were harvested and the pellets were washed twice with PBS. Cells were then fixed in 18% formaldehyde with 1.65β€‰ΞΌmol/l rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. Fixed cells were kept overnight at 4Β°C. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Confocal Laser Scan Microscopy and Flow Cytometry MicroscopyFor F-actin location, PANC-1 cells were fixed for 20β€‰min in paraformaldehyde in PBS, put on ice, permeabilized for 5β€‰min in 0.2% Triton X-100, incubated with 5β€‰mU/ml FITC-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 30β€‰min, washed three times with PBS, and mounted with Antifade (Molecular Probes). Fixed cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy.27 Flow cytometry was used to analyze the total amount of fluorescence in 1 Γ— 105 PANC-1 cells mentioned above.Double-labeled Immunofluorescent StainingPANC-1 cells grown on Lab-Tek 8-well permanox chamber slides and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20β€‰min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5β€‰min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with a blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30β€‰min and then with primary antibodies of affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibodies F-actin and MMP-9 (Tyr397; BD Biosciences), diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and maintained at 4Β°C in humidified air for 18β€‰h. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated in the presence of secondary antibodies of rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody labeled with FITC for 1β€‰h. For actin and MMP-9 staining, fixed cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Chemicon) for 15β€‰min at room temperature, followed by confocal laser scan microscopy after being washed twice with PBS as previously described.27Cell Invasion AssaysCell invasion assays were performed using 8-ΞΌm pore size Transwell Biocoat Control inserts (Becton Dickinson). Briefly, 5 Γ— 104 PANC-1 cells were seeded on a transwell containing 8-ΞΌm pores for the invasion assay. The chamers were put into the incubator at 37Β°C, 5% CO2. Cells on the top surface of the transwell were removed by scrubbing 48β€‰h after incubation.The cells were fixed for 45β€‰s with 95% ethanol, and stained for 20β€‰min with 0.1% (0.1β€‰ml) crystal violet (C6158-50G; Sigma Aldrich). We counted the number of transmembrane cells under an optical microscope, chose five high-power fields randomly, and checked each field of vision to evaluate the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells in vitro. The identified cells were counted and compared among groups. Individual experiments were done in duplicate and repeated four times.Animal StudiesFemale C57BL/6 mice at 6β€“8 weeks old were obtained from Qingdao Medical college, Qingdao University for tumor implantation. All animals were maintained in a sterile environment and cared for within the laboratory animal regulations of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (http://www.most.gov.cn/kytj/kytjzcwj/200411). Full details of the study approval by the ethics committee at the affiliated hospital of medical college, Qingdao University.We inoculated the nude mice with cell samples as described previously.28 Briefly, PANC-1 cells (5 Γ— 105 cells plus 50β€‰ΞΌl PBS per mouse) were orthotopically injected into the pancreas under the envelope near spleen of nude mice (n=12 for each variant). After 28 days, the mice were killed following the operation. The number of tumors seeded in the liver is used for assessment of metastases. The tumors from the pancreas were removed for H&E staining and immunohistochemistry analysis as described above. Orthotopic tumor induction was successful in 100% of the animals.Statistical AssessmentAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS13.0 software. The results were presented as meanΒ±s.d. of three replicate assays. Differences between various groups were assessed using ANOVA or Dunnett's t-test. A P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

lug, -9, or -cadherin xpression in ancreatic denocarcinoma issue. Figure 1 shows the representative expression patterns of Slug, MMP-9, and E-cadherin in ductal adenocarcinomas tissue. Positive staining of Slug was seen in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of tumor cells in 41 (68.3%) of 60 cases of adenocarcinoma (Figure 1a and b). MMP-9 was expressed in the cytoplasm in 25 (41%) cases (Figure 1c and d) and E-cadherin was expressed in the membrane in 24 (40%) cases (Figure 1e and f).The Relationship Between Slug, MMP-9, and E-Cadherin Expression and Pathological DataSlug, MMP-9, and E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with nodal metastases (P<0.01, respectively, Table 1). Only MMP-9 was significantly associated with nervous invasion (P<0.05, Table 1). Statistically significant correlations were found between Slug and MMP-9 expression (P<0.05). There was no significant relationship between the expression of Slug and the expression of E-cadherin (P>0.05, Table 2). No significant relationship between E-cadherin and MMP-9 expression was found (P>0.05, data not shown).Slug promotes MMP-9 Expression In vitro in PANC-1 CellsNormally, PANC-1 expresses Slug only at low levels, as analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot.15 In the present study, PANC-1 cells transfected with Slug cDNA expressed higher levels of Slug protein than the mock-transfected cells and untransfected PANC-1 cells as analyzed by western blot and immunohistology (P<0.05, respectively) (Figure 2a and b). Moreover, the cellular localization of overexpressed Slug was in the cytoplasm.We analyzed the effect of Slug on MMP-9 expression in PANC-1 cells, one of the most aggressive pancreatic cancer cell lines. RT-PCR, Q-PCR, and western blot analysis showed that Slug overexpression upregulated MMP-9 at the mRNA and protein level when compared with control or PANC-1 cells infected with empty vector (Figure 2bβ€“d).The ELISA assay of supernatant medium confirmed that overexpression of Slug in PANC-1 cells exhibited a higher level of MMP-9 protein compared with mock or untransfected PANC-1 (P=0.039) (Figure 2e).Zymographic analysis was used to assess whether the invasive nature of the Slug overexpression correlated with the gelatinase activity. Gelatinase activity of 82-kDa could be observed with Slug overexpression (P<0.01), but low activity was observed for mock and untransfected PANC-1 (Figure 2f).We then analyzed the effect of Slug overexpression on E-cadherin expression in PANC-1 cells and no significant change was found in PANC-1 cells (Figure 3bβ€“d).Subsequently, we investigated whether Slug directly promotes MMP-9 upregulation. Slug-transfected clones were treated with 0.1β€‰ΞΌmol/l BB94, a specific MMPs inhibitor for 24β€‰h. It was shown that BB94 decreased MMP-9 upregulation in mRNA and protein level induced by Slug (Figure 2g and h). BB94 did not have any effect on the expression of Slug and E-cadherin (data not shown).Slug Promotes the Formation of Pseudopodia in PANC-1 CellsThe morphology of non-treated PANC-1 appears as shown in (Figure 3a and b). PANC-1 cells showed obvious filopodia (Figure 3c and d) when transfected with Slug. Vector-transfected clones did not have any effect on the morphology of PANC-1 (data not shown).Slug Promotes the F-actin Polymerization of PANC-1 CellsFCM showed that the intracellular F-actin in Slug-transfected clones increased 2.1-fold (P<0.01, vs control) with no significant increase in vector-transfected clones (P>0.05, vs control) (Figure 4a). Confocal laser scan microscopy showed that in PANC-1 and mock-transfected PANC-1 cells, F-actin was external, and there was a lower intracellular F-actin density; the intracellular F-actin was polymerized in Slug-transfected clones (Figure 4d), moreover, in contrast to non-treated PANC-1 cells (Figure 4b) and vector-transfected cells (Figure 4c), hyperchromic F-actin outside the cells exhibited redistribution (Figure 4d). But in vector-transfected clones, no obvious intracellular F-actin polymerized was found (data not shown).Immunofluorescence Staining of MMP-9 and F-actinIn non-treated PANC-1 cells, MMP-9 and F-actin are primarily located in the perinuclear cisterna (Figure 5aβ€“c), but in Slug-transfected clones, MMP-9 and F-actin are primarily located in the anterior extremity of the filopodia (Figure 5cβ€“e). There is no obvious location change for F-actin and MMP-9 in vector-transfected clones (data not shown).Slug Promotes Invasion in PANC-1 Cells In-vitroTo investigate whether Slug promotes metastasis, we carried out in vitro invasion assays. The number of transmembrane PANC-1 cells was 68.74Β±7.34 (Figure 6a), overexpression of Slug in PANC-1 cells was 117.16Β±8.45 (Figure 6a), and Slug overexpression combined with 0.1β€‰ΞΌmol/l BB94 for 24β€‰h was 63.14Β±6.49 (Figure 6b). Therefore, overexpression of Slug enhanced invasion in PANC-1 cells. The difference was statistically significant (Figure 6b).Slug Promotes Metastasis In vivoFour weeks after the graft, the animals were killed and autopsy was conducted to remove organs. Liver metastasis and lung metastasis occurred in four mice and one mouse, respectively, in PANC-1cells, and three liver metastases in control vector-transfected mice. Slug-transfected cells exhibited a highly invasive behavior, 2 skin metastases, 6 lung metastases, and 10 liver metastases occurred in Slug-transfected cells. Differences of metastasized nodes in lung and liver reached statistical significance in Slug-transfected mice compared with vector-transfected mice (Table 3).Slug promotes MMP-9 Expression In vivoTo verify the Slug-dependent upregulation of MMP-9 expression under in vivo conditions, the MMP-9 expression profile of Slug and control vector-transfected cells was examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against human MMP-9 on xenograft paraffin sections. The Slug-transfected cells implanted in vivo were more intensely stained by MMP-9 antibodies compared with that of empty vector-transfected cells (Figure 7). As demonstrated in vitro, no change of staining was observed for E-cadherin in the Slug-transfected and vector-transfected cells in the in vivo xenograft model.

he importance of lug, a transcription factor and -cadherin repressor, to allow cancer cells to downregulate epithelial markers and upregulate mesenchymal markers in order to become motile and invasive has recently been reported.16, 30 oreover, lug has been shown to modulate expression of a variety of adhesion structures, including desmosomes and adherens junctions.31 ecent studies have shown that lug is upregulated in many types of epithelial cancers, including breast,9 gastric carcinomas,32 esophageal squamous cell,10 ovarian carcinoma,33 and cholangiocarcinoma. lug seems to have an important role in tumor progression and invasion as well as in the downregulation of the adhesion molecule -cadherin.
n our study, we reported that immunohistochemical analysis using clinical samples revealed the expression of lug in pancreatic cancer, suggesting that lug might have a critical role regarding tumor node metastasis in pancreatic cancer, as lug reportedly does in other types of malignancies.9, 10, 34, 35  significant relationship was observed between lug upregulation and tumor node metastasis status; lug expression was increased in node-positive tumors. lug may serve as a marker for the prediction of the malignancy of pancreatic cancer after operation. owever, in a previous study a correlation between the expression level of lug and tumor node metastasis status was not obvious in human pancreatic cancer specimens.15 he difference may be because of the limited number of patients or the evaluation the immunohistochemistry results.
-cadherin is an important mediator of epithelial adhesion and signaling transduction. oss of -cadherin expression has been described in invasion and metastasis of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer.34, 35, 36 n the present study, we found that reduced -cadherin was significantly associated with histological grade,  stage and tumor-node-metastasis, but expression of lug in pancreatic cancer cells showed no significant relation to a decreased expression of -cadherin.hese results are consistent with recent data indicating that lug was not associated with -cadherin in hepatocellular carcinoma.8
 previous study found that there was no relationship between the expression of -cadherin or -9 with stage, histology stage, or perineural invasion, but a significant relationship was found between the expression of -cadherin/-9 ratio and perineural invasion.37 n this study, we found that expression of -9 was significantly associated with nodal metastasis and nervous metastasis in pancreatic cancer tissue; results were consistent with previous study.19 e also found that the pancreatic cancer tissue with high lug expression had strong -9 expression, and moreover the expression of lug was significantly associated with -9. his suggests that lug promotes migration and invasion, and may correlate with the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, but not with -cadherin expression.
o test the significance of lug expression in pancreatic cancer, we transfected the lug c. DNA into pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1. After transfection, the invasive ability of PANC-1 cells increased dramatically. Slug-transfected cells implanted into nude mice metastasized widely compared with parental untransfected cells. This corroborated the role of Slug in pancreatic cancer progression, and indicates that Slug has an important role in pancreatic cancer invasion and metastasis.
We also found that Slug cDNA promoted metastasis in pancreatic cancer, but it did not inhibit the expression of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer cells. We suggested that Slug accelerates pancreatic cancer progression, but not through E-cadherin repression; results that are consistent with a previous study.16 Thus, it would be unlikely that E-cadherin would be the only target gene for Slug proteins, and similarly unlikely that it drives the whole process. These apparent discrepancies in relation to E-cadherin regulation could be a reflection of the specific contribution of various cellular contexts.
It is reasonable to theorize that Slug is largely involved in migration, ie, cell motility of tumor cells. However, it has been largely unclear how Slug proteins exhibit the invasive activity, and the exact mechanism of Slug-dependent invasion is almost unknown. The present study for the first time has explored the relationship between Slug and MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer and clarified the novel mechanism.
In the present study, we found that MMP-9 is mainly located in the perinuclear cisterna in PANC-1 cells, but in Slug-transfected clones, MMP-9 is mainly located in the anterior extremity of the filopodia, allowing MMP-9 to digest the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Slug apparently upregulated both the expression levels and activities of MMP-9, leading to enhancement of the invasive activity. MMP-9-specific BB94 blocked Slug-induced Matrigel invasion in the malignant PANC-1 cells. These findings indicate that Slug may regulate the metastatic nature of PANC-1 by directly upregulating MMP-9, through enhancement of the invasive activity, ie, the degradation of the ECM. Such Slug-dependent transcriptional change in MMP-9 genes is a new and interesting finding, and the detailed mechanisms, especially the transcriptional factors linking to Slug, may be clarified in future studies.
A key cellular process associated with the invasive or metastatic program in many cancers is the transformation of epithelial cells toward a mesenchymal state, a process called EMT. Actin-dependent protrusion of cell pseudopodia is a critical element of mesenchymal cell migration and, therefore, of cancer metastasis. However, whether EMT occurs in human cancers and, in particular, whether it is a prerequisite for tumor cell invasion and metastasis, remains a subject of debate.38
F-ascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. Fascin forms stable actin bundles with slow dissociation kinetics in vitro and is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 39 by protein kinase C (PKC). Cancer cells use invasive finger-like protrusions termed invadopodia to invade into and degrade the ECM.39 In the present study, we initially analyzed the intracellular F-actin in Slug-transfected clones and FCM showed that the intracellular F-actin in Slug-transfected clones increased 2.1-fold. We then studied the expression of F-actin using immunofluorescence staining and determined that, in non-treated PANC-1 cells, F-actin is mainly located in the perinuclear cisterna; however, in Slug-transfected clones, F-actin is principally located in the anterior extremity of the filopodia. The results suggested the invadopodia in PANC-1 cells was formed by intracellular F-actin polymerization induced by Slug. We also found that MMP-9 and F-actin together were mainly located in the anterior extremity of the filopodia in Slug-transfected clones, suggesting Slug might transport MMP-9 via F-actin networks. These findings indicate that Slug may regulate the metastatic nature of PANC-1 by stimulating cell motility (probably by modulation of the cytoskeletal structure that is well established).
Taken together, there is a possibility that Slug may not only transcriptionally increase MMP-9 expression, but is also responsible for the remodeling of the cytoskeleton network. Acting in concert, they may together mediate invasion and metastasis in PANC-1 cells; further study is warranted to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved, and also to evaluate the potential scope of application in additional human carcinoma cell types.
