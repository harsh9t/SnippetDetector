BACKGROUND: Placement of an elastic biodegradable patch onto a subacute myocardial infarct (MI) provides temporary elastic support that may act to effectively alter adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling processes. METHODS: Two weeks after permanent left coronary ligation in Lewis rats, the infarcted anterior wall was covered with polyester urethane urea (MI + PEUU; n = 15) or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (MI + ePTFE; n = 15) patches, or had no implantation (MI + sham; n = 12). Eight weeks after surgery, cardiac function and histology were assessed. RESULTS: The ventricular wall in the MI + ePTFE and MI + sham groups was composed of fibrous tissue, whereas PEUU implantation induced α-smooth muscle actin-positive muscle bundles coexpressing sarcomeric α-actinin and cardiac-specific troponin-T. This pattern of colocalization was also found in developing embryonic myocardium. Cardiac transcription factors Nkx-2.5 and GATA-4 were strongly expressed in the muscle bundles. In the MI + sham group, end-diastolic LV cavity area (EDA) increased and the percentage of fractional area change (%FAC) decreased. For ePTFE patched animals, both EDA and %FAC decreased. In contrast, with MI + PEUU patching, %FAC increased and EDA was maintained. With dobutamine-stress echocardiography, MI + PEUU patched LVs possessed contractile reserve significantly larger than the MI + sham group. CONCLUSIONS: MI + PEUU patch implantation onto subacute infarcted myocardium induced muscle cellularization with characteristics of early developmental cardiomyocytes as well as providing a functional reserve.
