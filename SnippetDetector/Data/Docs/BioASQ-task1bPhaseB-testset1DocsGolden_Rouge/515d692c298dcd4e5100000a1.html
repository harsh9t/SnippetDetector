Further analysis revealed that the DNA sequence, TTCAAGTCCCGCCCTCCGCT from -65 to -46.
In an effort to identify transcription factors that bind to the CACCC element, we found that purified human Sp1, as well as Sp1 in HeLa nuclear extract, can specifically bind to a DNA probe.
Upstream control region (UCR) containing a GC-rich motif (5'-GGGCGGG-3') and to a unique enhancer core (5'-TGCGGTC-3').
Gel shift competition studies and DNase I footprinting analyses revealed that Sp1 specifically interacts with the CACCC motif.
SP1 contains three Cys2His2-type zinc finger motifs and it is generally accepted that its mode of action is mediated mainly by binding to the decanucleotide consensus sequence 5β€²-(G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(C/T)-3β€² in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).
