The in silico prediction of the complete structure of genes is one of the main challenges of bioinformatics.
A critical part in the gene structure prediction is to identify the boundaries between exons and introns (i.
e.
splice sites) in the coding region.
Several advanced bioinformatics tools have been developed for the precise delineation of a given gene structure: WPSS, SCGPred, TICO, GLIMMER, MetWAMer, WebScipio, GeneSeqer,  SplicePredictor, DGSplicer, Transcript Assembly Program (TAP), GeneBuilder, SeqHelp, HSPL, RNASPL, HEXON, CDSB, HBR, FGENE and FGENEH for human genes.
