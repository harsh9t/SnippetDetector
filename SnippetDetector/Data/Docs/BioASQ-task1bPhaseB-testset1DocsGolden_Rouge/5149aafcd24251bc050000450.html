Several tools have been developed to detect protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by text mining the biomedical literature.
Two main computational approaches used for this task are co-occurrence-based methods and Natural Language Processing methods.
Biomedical text mining tools for PPI identification are the following (in alphabetical order): BioCreative Meta Server, BioMap, eFIP, Extracting Functional Impact of Phosphorylation, GeneView, HAPPI, Hidden Vector State model, iHop, LAITOR, OntoGene, OpenDMAP, PIE (Protein interaction information extraction system), PPI finder (Paired-PPI Finder), PPInterFinder, PPIs, PolySearch, PreBind and Textomy, Protopia, STRING, TafTalent.
