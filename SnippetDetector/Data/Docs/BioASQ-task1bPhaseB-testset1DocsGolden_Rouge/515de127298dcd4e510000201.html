OBJECTIVE: To study the value of methotrexate and the requirement for additional anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of severe chronic iridocyclitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ).
Most experience among DMARD's / immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
MTX treatment was started an average of 11.
4 months after the onset of uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor for development of early cataract requiring surgery in children with JIA-associated uveitis is the presence of posterior synechia at the time of diagnosis of uveitis.
Mean duration of remission was 10.
3 months.
Relapse rate after the withdrawal of MTX was established.
MTX was discontinued because of inactive uveitis in 13 patients.
METHODS: Data of 22 pediatric JIA patients who were being treated with MTX for active uveitis were studied retrospectively.
Six patients had a relapse within the first year after the withdrawal.
CONCLUSIONS: MTX seems to be an effective therapy for JIA associated uveitis.
Four patients were still in remission after 7.
5 months.
Among children with systemic arthritis, 160 ever received a biologic DMARD; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor use was associated with polyarthritis ( OR 2.
5, 95 % CI 3.
8-16 ), while interleukin 1 inhibitor use was not.
