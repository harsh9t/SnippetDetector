AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of cellular energy.
The activation of AMPK by metformin prevents cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI).
Adiponectin protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through an AMPK-dependent mechanism.
AMPK activation by metformin and the subsequent suppression of TLRs activity could be considered as a target in protecting the infarcted heart.
