In 1955, the production of itaconic acid was firstly described for Ustilago maydis.
Some Aspergillus species, like A.
itaconicus and A.
terreus, show the ability to synthesize this organic acid and A.
terreus can secrete significant amounts to the media.
Itaconic acid is mainly supplied by biotechnological processes with the fungus Aspergillus terreus.
Cloning of the cadA gene into the citric acid producing fungus A.
niger showed that it is possible to produce itaconic acid also in a different host organism.
