We show reduced SFRP3 expression in malignant melanoma tissues and cell lines compared to normal cells.
SFRP3 down-regulation has been demonstrated in other cancers [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], and it was speculated that the cause for SFRP3 down-regulation could be loss of heterozygosity in the SFRP3 loci, 2q31-33.
In conclusion, this is the first report to show that sFRP3 expression promotes cell growth, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis in renal cancer cells.
Together, these data suggest that Frzb/sFRP3 and DN-LRP5 exhibit antitumor activity through the reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and inhibition of MMP activities in a subset of prostate cancer.
These data suggest that SFRP3 acts as a metastasis suppressor in malignant melanoma.
