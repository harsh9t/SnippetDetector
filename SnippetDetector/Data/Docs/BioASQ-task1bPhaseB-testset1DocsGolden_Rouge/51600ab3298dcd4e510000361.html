Ξ±-Secretase belongs to the family of a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs), and ADAM10 is the primary candidate for this anti-amyloidogenic activity.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were recently shown to be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n/(GGCCCC)n repeat in the C9ORF72 gene.
There is a growing recognition for their profound roles in a wide spectrum of diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Large expansions of a non-coding GGGGCC-repeat in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene are a common cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
Ξ²-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the transmembrane aspartyl protease that catalyzes the first cleavage step in the proteolysis of the APP to the amyloid Ξ²-protein (AΞ²), a process involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
