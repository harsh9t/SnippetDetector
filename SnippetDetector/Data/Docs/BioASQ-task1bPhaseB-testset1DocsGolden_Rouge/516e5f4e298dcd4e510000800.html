Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, protects dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxin-induced damage.
SAHA is predominantly an inhibitor of class I HDACs.
However, it can also bind to class IIa HDACs and has been shown to degrade class IIa HDACs at the protein level in vitro.
The neuroprotective effects of SAHA were mediated in part by promoting release of neurotrophic factors from astroglia through inhibition of histone deacetylation.
SAHA can lead to the degradation of class IIa HDACs 4 and 5 via RANBP2 mediated proteasome degradation in vitro.
