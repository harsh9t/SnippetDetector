There is only little information relative to their abundance, distribution, subcellular localization, interactions, or cellular functions.
As such, the HPP aims to create a comprehensive, detailed resource to help elucidate protein functions and to advance medical treatment.
The C-HPP consortium was established to organize a collaborative network among the research teams responsible for protein mapping of individual chromosomes and to identify compelling biological and genetic mechanisms influencing colocated genes and their protein products.
The C-HPP aims to foster the development of proteome analysis and integration of the findings from related molecular -omics technology platforms through collaborations among universities, industries, and private research groups.
Our results will contribute to the accomplishment of the primary goal of the C-HPP in identifying so-called "missing proteins" and generating a whole protein catalog for each chromosome.
