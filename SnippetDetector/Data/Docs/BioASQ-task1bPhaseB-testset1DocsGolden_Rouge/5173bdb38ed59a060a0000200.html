The TP73 gene, due to the presence of two promoters (P1 and P2) in its 5' flanking region, encodes a fully transcriptionally active domain (TAp73) and the amino terminus deleted (Ξ”Np73).
TAp73 possesses pro-apoptotic properties, while deltaNp73 has anti-apoptotic functions.
Alternative 3'-end splicing results in generation of at least seven TAp73 distinctive isoforms ( Ξ±, Ξ², Ξ³, etc ).
