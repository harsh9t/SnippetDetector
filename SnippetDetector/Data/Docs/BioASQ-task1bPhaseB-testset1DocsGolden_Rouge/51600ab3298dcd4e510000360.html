There is a growing recognition for the profound role of G-quadruplexes in a wide spectrum of diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were recently shown to be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n/(GGCCCC)n repeat in the C9ORF72 gene.
Treatment with a G-quadruplex interactive ligand was shown to achieve antifibrotic action.
G-quadruplex forming sequences have also been linked with ADAM10 a primary candidate for anti-amyloidogenic activity in Alzheimer's.
A G-quadruplex-interactive agent, telomestatin (SOT-095), induces telomere shortening with apoptosis and enhances chemosensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia.
