The first-line standard therapy for uveitis is topical and systemic corticosteroids, often reinforced by methotrexate as a second-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
MTX has a topical steroid sparing effect as well.
Early treatment with MTX is advocated to prevent complications such as cataract.
There are no trial data on the effect of MTX.
Most experience among DMARD's/ immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
However, controlled studies in uveitis are still missing, so that treatment with MTX and all other immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) only reaches an evidence level III (expert opinion, clinical experience or descriptive study).
Biologic DMARDs can be used with Methotrexate in refractory uveitis as well.
