Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene.
The principal genetic cause was first reported in 1999 when the association with mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene was identified.
BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is an uncommon neurodevelopmental disorder with an incidence of 1:9,000 live female births.
Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by loss of acquired skills after a period of normal development in infant girls.
In all, we identified 45 different MECP2 mutations in 102 of these RTT patients.
Out of the 365 cases, 315 had MECP2 gene mutations and 3 had de novo CDKL5 gene mutations.
Recently, this syndrome has been associated with mutations of the MECP2 gene, a transcriptional repressor of still unknown target genes.
In the present study, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography was used to detect mutations in the MECP2 gene in 20 Malaysian RS patients.
The aim of this study is to delineate the molecular characteristics of Rett syndrome in China based on the largest group of Chinese patients ever studied.
Two patients have multiple deletions within the MECP2 gene.
The results were grouped by MECP2 mutation and compared.
