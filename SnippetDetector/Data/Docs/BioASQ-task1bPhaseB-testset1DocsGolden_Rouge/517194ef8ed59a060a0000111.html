Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria tropica in man.
Diagnosis of cerebral parasitoses is dependent on the causative agent.
Apical membrane antigen 1 is an asexual blood-stage protein expressed in the invasive merozoite form of Plasmodia species, which are the causative agent of malaria.
P.
vivax was detected as the causative agent in all blood samples except one P.
ovale.
High resolution 31P-NMR has been used for the non-invasive observation of metabolites and metabolic rates in blood of normal mice and of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria.
The genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a tandemly repeated, linear element of 6 kb.
Plasmodium vivax is an important human pathogen causing malaria in more temperate climates of the world.
The aspects of distribution of drug resistant strains of P.
falciparum and the main principles of determination of the malaria causative agent sensitivity to antimalaria drugs are presented.
In contrast, it has been thought that Plasmodium spp.
, the causative agent of malaria, rely mainly on cytosolic glycolysis but not mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production during blood stages.
