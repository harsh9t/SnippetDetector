Limiting antibiotic use is one of the most important measures to prevent and control emergence of antibiotic resistance.
Yet recent well-designed studies have demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotic use is of significant benefit to patients prone to developing infections.
The pros and cons of prophylactic antibiotic use must therefore be carefully considered.
Guidelines do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that they may reduce the number of exacerbations.
There is also evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating COPD exacerbations in the community, but this is most convincing in patients with severe airflow obstruction and there is uncertainty regarding the value of antibiotics in patients with mild airflow obstruction.
There is some evidence to suggest that the decision to use antibiotics can be guided by the use of procalcitonin, although this needs to be confirmed in further studies.
Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are an important cause of morbidity and healthcare expenditure.
In the first 2 populations, use of antibiotics was associated with an increase in carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but in intensive care patients the opposite was documented.
In hospitalized patients, antibiotics decrease treatment failure and reduce mortality.
