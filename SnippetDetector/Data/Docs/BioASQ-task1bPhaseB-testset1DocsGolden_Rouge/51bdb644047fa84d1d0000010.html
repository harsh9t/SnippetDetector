Transmembrane nucleoporins (NUPs) are integral membrane components of the eukaryotic nuclear pore, playing an important role in the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) assembly.
Even though the NPC is a conserved feature of all eukaryotes, different lineages possess some distinct transmembrane NUP subunits.
Currently, four human transmembrane NUPs have been characterized, namely: NDC1 (also known as TMEM48 or NET3 or hNDC1), POM121 (also known as Nup121), GP210 (also known as Nuclear pore membrane glycoprotein 210 or Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein POM 210, POM210 or Nup210) and TMEM33 (or DB83).
