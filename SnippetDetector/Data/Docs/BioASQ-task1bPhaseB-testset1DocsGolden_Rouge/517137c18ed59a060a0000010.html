The chromodomain (chromatin organizer modifier domain) is a highly conserved motif, 40-50 amino acids in length, present in a wide range of animal and plant proteins involved in chromatin organization.
Chromodomain-containing proteins can be classified into boader families based, particularly, on the presence of other types of domains.
Chromodomain is present in: the heterochromatin proteins HP1 alpha and HP1 beta, chromointgrases (e.
g.
Tf1 integrase) the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD) and CHD 1-like (CHD1L), CReMM (chromatin-related mesenchymal modulator), dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3), the chromointegrase of the LTR-retrotransposons, the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, the mouse Polycomb homologs (Cbx2, Cbx4, Cbx6, Cbx7, Cbx8), the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins and the CDY-like protein (CDYL), the histone acetyltransferases TgMYST-A and β€“B, MRG-1 and -15 (MORF4-Related Gene on chromosome 15), ADP/ATP translocase 1, MPP8, MSL3, NlMof, Chp1, Chriz, dMi-2, Corto, cpSRP43, KISMET, PICKLE (PKL), ScoHET1 and ScoHET2.
