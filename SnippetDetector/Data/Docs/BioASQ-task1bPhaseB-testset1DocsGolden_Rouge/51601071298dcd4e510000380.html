Reverse Vaccinology (RV) was first applied to serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis.
This work induced further research of other pathogens in the same way: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, group B streptococci, Helicobacter pylori and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Concerning animal-affecting organisms, RV has been applied for vaccine design against Theileria parva, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae,  Echinococcus granulosus, Ehrlichia ruminantium, Leishmania spp, Rhipicephalus microplus and Brucella melitensis.
