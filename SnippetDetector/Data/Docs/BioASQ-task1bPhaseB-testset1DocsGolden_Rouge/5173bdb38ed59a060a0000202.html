The Trp73 gene belongs to the p53 family of transcription factors and, like the other members, is transcribed into different isoforms [1-4].
TP73 gene contains two promoters, encoding the transcriptional domain-containing (TAp73) and the amino deleted (DNp73) isoforms [5, 6].
Furthermore alternative splicing at the 3'-end (to generate a, b, g, etc isoforms) and 5'-end (to generate D2, D3 and D2-3 isoforms) results in generation of at least 14 different transcripts, with different abilities to promote or repress apoptosis [7, 8].
