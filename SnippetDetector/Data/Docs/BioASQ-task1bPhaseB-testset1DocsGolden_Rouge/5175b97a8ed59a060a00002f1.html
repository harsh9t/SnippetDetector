DNA damage induces apoptosis and many apoptotic genes are regulated via alternative splicing, but little is known about the control mechanisms.
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs also has an important function in the regulation of apoptosis.
Caspase family genes play a critical role in the initiation and execution of programmed cell death.
We demonstrate that E2F1 requires SC35 to switch the alternative splicing profile of various apoptotic genes such as c-flip, caspases-8 and -9 and Bcl-x, towards the expression of pro-apoptotic splice variants.
SRp55 is one of the most ubiquitous splicing factors and one that can be up-regulated by DNA damage in the absence of p53, and we had previously found that depletion of its activity increased resistance to DNA damage in p53-dependant manner.
These findings show that modulation of splicing activity in p53-deficient cells during the early response to sub-lethal DNA damage results in a change in the splicing of target genes, thus modifying the cellular response to genotoxic agents.
Its regulation is governed by a variety of mechanisms, including variation in the expression levels of splicing factors engaged in spliceosome formation.
It has been well-demonstrated that the apoptotic function of E2F1 involves its ability to transactivate pro-apoptotic target genes.
