OBJECTIVE: The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein is a Ca-storage protein in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.
The histidine-rich calcium binding protein Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.
Recent transgenic studies revealed that this protein inhibits the maximal rates of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-transport, leading to cardiac dysfunction.
In view of the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-cycling in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, we designed this study to gain further insight into the role of HRC during ischemia/reperfusion.
In the present study, we assessed the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human arrhythmias by adenoviral expression of the human wild-type ) or mutant HRC ( HRC ( S96A ) ) in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.
Consistent with these findings, HRC reduced maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake rate to a higher extent than HRC ( WT ).
RESULTS: The transgenic mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of HRC was utilized and cardiac contractile parameters were assessed before and after ischemia/reperfusion injury by Langendorff perfusion.
After a 20-min stabilization period, the hearts were subjected to 40 min of global ischemia, followed by 60 min of reperfusion.
This improvement was accompanied by smaller infarcts and lower creatine kinase release.
