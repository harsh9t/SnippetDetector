TAp63Ξ³ is the most potent transcription activator [1], [2].
The longest isoform, the TAp73Ξ±, generally shows weaker activity than TAp73Ξ² and TAp73Ξ³ that exhibit stronger TA potential (7,8).
Furthermore alternative splicing at the 3'-end (to generate Ξ±, Ξ², Ξ³, etc isoforms) and 5'-end (to generate Ξ”2, Ξ”3 and Ξ”2-3 isoforms) results in generation of at least 14 different transcripts, with different abilities to promote or repress apoptosis [7, 8].
The COOH-terminal variants arise due to alternate splicing resulting in multiple isoforms that exhibit varying degrees of TApotential (6,7).
Given that the transactivation activity resides in the protein's N-terminus, TAp63 isoforms function as transcription factors inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
