A heterozygous G to T substitution at nucleotide position 34 (Gly to Cys) was found in 3 patients.
KRAS exon 2 mutations were detected in a total of 62 patients with the two methods combined, comprising 11 different mutant alleles.
The frequencies for MASI (of all types) varied between individual oncogenes, being relatively high for EGFR (75%) and KRAS (58%) and lower for BRAF (38%) and PIK3CA (8%).
Activating mutations in KRAS are identified in most pancreatic cancers.
