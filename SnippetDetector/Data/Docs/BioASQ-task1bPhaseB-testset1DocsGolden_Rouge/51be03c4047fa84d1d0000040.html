Prothymosin alpha (ProTΞ±) (encoded in human by the PTMA gene) is a ubiquitous, highly acidic nuclear polypeptide.
During early apoptosis, proTΞ± is cleaved by activated caspase-3, with a primary attach site being D99, close to its carboxyl-terminus.
The role of the cleaved decapeptide -- proTΞ±(100-109) -- is not fully understood.
proTΞ±(100-109), which contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) for ProTΞ±, has been demonstrated to have immunostimulatory properties, such as to stimulate lymphocytes and neutrophils and induce dendritic cell maturation.
