Allopurinol was shown in a number of clinical trial to be safe and effective for treatment of neonatal asphyxia.
Allopurinol  improves short-term and long-term clinical outcomes of neonatal asphyxia.
Allopurinol should be administered as soon as possible.
Postulated mechanism of allopurinol action in this setting is prevention of hypoxia-perfusion injury by reduction of free radical formation.
