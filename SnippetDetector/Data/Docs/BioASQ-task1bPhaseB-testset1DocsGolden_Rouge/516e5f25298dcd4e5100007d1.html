H209/V6 cells are cross-resistant to some drugs that interact with topoisomerase II but not mitoxantrone.
OBJECTIVE: Topoisomerase II alpha content, topoisomerase II catalytic activity and drug sensitivities to the topoisomerase II inhibitors, doxorubicin and etoposide, were examined in a panel of 14 unselected human lung cancer cell lines in order to determine the relationship between topoisomerase II and drug sensitivities to the topoisomerase II inhibitors.
Etoposide is effective as an anti-tumour drug by inhibiting eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II via establishing a covalent complex with DNA.
We have prepared full-length Drosophila and human topoisomerase II and truncation constructs containing the amino-terminal ATPase domain, and we have analyzed their biochemical properties.
We examined whether heat stress could enhance the sensitivity of human colon cancer WiDr cells to topoisomerase II-targeting anticancer agents, etoposide and teniposide ( VM-26 ), and also determined the most effective timing for the drug administration after exposure to hyperthermia.
In an attempt to clarify the role of drug-induced protein-associated DNA breaks in the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin and etoposide, their cellular effects were compared in 2 human small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) lines, characterized by differential sensitivity to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors.
