The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC), a 165 kDa sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, regulates SR Ca cycling during excitationβ€“contraction coupling.
HRC mutations or polymorphisms lead to cardiac dysfunction.
The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
