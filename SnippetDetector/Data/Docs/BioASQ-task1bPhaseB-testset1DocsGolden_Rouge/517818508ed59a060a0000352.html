Rett syndrome is one of the most common causes of complex disability in girls.
No patients had FOXG1 mutation.
Here we report a detailed mutational analysis of 62 patients from UK and Italian archives, representing the first comparative study among different populations and one of the largest number of cases so far analyzed.
Mutations were identified in 44/55 (80%) unrelated classical sporadic and familial RTT patients, but only 1/5 (20%) sporadic cases with suggestive but non-diagnostic features of RTT.
Both nonsense (R168X and R255X) and missense (R106W and R306C) mutations have been found, with multiple recurrences.
