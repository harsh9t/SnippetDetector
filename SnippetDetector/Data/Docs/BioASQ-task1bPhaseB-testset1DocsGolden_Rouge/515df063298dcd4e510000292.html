Guidelines do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that they may reduce the number of exacerbations.
Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are an important cause of morbidity and healthcare expenditure.
In hospitalized patients, antibiotics decrease treatment failure and reduce mortality.
In the first 2 populations, use of antibiotics was associated with an increase in carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but in intensive care patients the opposite was documented.
A short prophylactic treatment course with azithromycin is a good alternative in the management of patients with severe, advanced COPD, and could lead to an improvement in social and healthcare costs Yet recent well-designed studies have demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotic use is of significant benefit to patients prone to developing infections.
Limiting antibiotic use is one of the most important measures to prevent and control emergence of antibiotic resistance.
A statistically significant reduction in the number of acute infectious episodes and hospital admissions (22) was observed in the treated group versus the control group ( 249 and 45, respectively ).
These studies demonstrate that antibiotics do more than cause resistance.
The pros and cons of prophylactic antibiotic use must therefore be carefully considered.
