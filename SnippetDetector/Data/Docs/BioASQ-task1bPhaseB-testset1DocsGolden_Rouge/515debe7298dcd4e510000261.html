Autistic behavior is often accompanied by numerous disturbing symptoms on the part of gastrointestinal system, such as abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea.
The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in a general population of children with autism or autistic spectrum disorder.
Many children with autism spectrum disorders suffer from gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain.
Lactase deficiency not associated with intestinal inflammation or injury is common in autistic children and may contribute to abdominal discomfort, pain and observed aberrant behavior.
The ASD group had significantly increased past vomiting and diarrhoea compared with the TD group and more abdominal pain than the SEN group.
RESULTS: The incidence of constipation in the control subjects with abdominal pain was higher than reported for normal children.
The most common symptom was diarrhea, which occurred in 17 percent.
OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that autistic children may have significant gastrointestinal symptoms.
We thus aimed to assess the prevalence of fecal loading in autistic children with gastrointestinal symptoms and to identify possible predictors of constipation.
Details of stool habit, abdominal pain, dietary history, and laxative use were obtained from case notes.
