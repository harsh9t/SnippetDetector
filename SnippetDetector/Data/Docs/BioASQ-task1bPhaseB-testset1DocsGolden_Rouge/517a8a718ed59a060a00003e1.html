ATPase activity of K562 human erythroleukemic cell was studied to understand why the erythrocyte sodium pump activity is decreased in hyperthyroidism.
In patients suffering from hyperthyroidism dependent on Graves' disease, a reduction in Na +, K+ATP ase activity has been demonstrated in red blood cells, as well as an inverse correlation between this enzymatic action and free triiodothyronine ( FT3 ) levels.
Thyroid hormone is known to modulate cell membrane sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase.
To determine whether the activity of this enzyme differed in patients with nonthyroidal illness with low levels of circulating thyroid hormones and patients with documented clinical hypothyroidism, we measured Na/K-ATPase activity in red blood cells from patients with hypo - and hyperthyroidism, patients with nonthyroid disease with and without reduced circulating levels of thyroid hormone, and normal subjects.
ATPase activity of K562 cell lysates was assayed by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP.
ATPase activity of K562 cell grown in the presence of T3 for 48 hours was significantly higher than that of control.
These data confirm that hyperthyroid patients have decreased red cell Na/K-ATPase activity and provide direct evidence that erythrocyte ATPase activity is increased in hypothyroid patients.
