The GIT diseases considered here can be grouped into three groups based on symptomology: 1) production of diarrhea: AAD, CDD, ID, TD, 2) the destruction or inflammation of tissues in the stomach, large intestine, ileal reservoir, or bowel: NEC, Pouch, and HPP, 3) abdominal pain, flatulence, and irregular bowel movements: IBS.
CDD, which is also associated with antibiotic use, occurs mostly in older adults, and usually only occurs in hospitalized patients [55].
When treating HPP, patients are prescribed antibiotics which results in some individuals developing AAD.
These results provide some evidence that viable Bifidobacterium lactis strain Bb 12, added to an acidified infant formula, has some protective effect against acute diarrhea in healthy children.
