End.
The human HOXD complex contains nine genes HOXD1, HOXD3, HOXD4, HOXD8, HOXD9, HOXD10, HOXD11, HOXD12 and HOXD13, which are clustered from 3β€² to 5β€² in an approximately 100-kb stretch on chromosome 2q31.
1, with HOXD1 at the 3' end and HOXD13 the 5β€².
Both children are heterozygous for a deletion that eliminates at least eight (HOXD3-HOXD13) of the nine genes in the HOXD cluster.
