Several genetic diseases are triggered by nonsense mutations leading to the formation of truncated and defective proteins. Aminoglycosides have the capability to mediate a bypass of stop mutations during translation thus resulting in a rescue of protein expression. So far no attention has been directed to obesity-associated stop mutations as targets for nonsense suppression. Herein, we focus on the characterization of the melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R) nonsense allele W16X identified in obese subjects. Cell culture assays revealed a loss-of-function of Mc4r(X16) characterized by impaired surface expression and defect signaling. The aminoglycoside G-418 restored Mc4r(X16) function in vitro demonstrating that Mc4r(X16) is susceptible to nonsense suppression. For the evaluation of nonsense suppression in vivo, we generated a Mc4r(X16) knock-in mouse line by gene targeting. Mc4r(X16) knock-in mice developed hyperphagia, impaired glucose tolerance, severe obesity and an increased body length demonstrating that this new mouse model resembles typical characteristics of Mc4r deficiency. In a first therapeutic trial, the aminoglycosides gentamicin and amikacin induced no amelioration of obesity. Further experiments with Mc4r(X16) knock-in mice will be instrumental to establish nonsense suppression for Mc4r as an obesity-associated target gene expressed in the central nervous system.
