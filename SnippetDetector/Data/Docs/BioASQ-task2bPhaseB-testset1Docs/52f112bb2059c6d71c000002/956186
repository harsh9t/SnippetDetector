The 5' termini of many viral and cellular mRNAs contain sequences of the type m7G(5")pppNm. An RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase that specifically methylates the 5'-terminal guanosine residue of RNAs ending in the dinucleoside triphosphate G(5')pppN- has been purified from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Approximately two-thirds of the methyltransferase activity detected in an assay employing umnethylated vaccinia virus mRNA as acceptor was located in the cytoplasm when cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization; 30% of the cytoplasmic activity was associated with ribosomes but was removed by washing with 0.5 M KCl. The enzyme was purified 165-fold from the cytoplasm by removing nucleic acid by phase partition followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, denatured DNA-agarose, and CM-Sephadex. The partially purified enzyme preparation methylated heterologous tRNAs as well as vaccinia mRNA, but the tRNA methyltransferases could be separated from the mRNA activity by sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The product of the partially purified enzyme using vaccinia mRNA as substrate was exclusively 7-methylguanosine located in the terminal dinucleoside triphosphate. In addition to RNAs and synthetic polyribonucleotides terminating in a dinucleoside triphosphate, free G(5')pppG could be methylated but GTP, GDP, and G(5')pppG could not. The enzyme also methylated the dinucleoside diphosphate G(5')pppG but much less efficiently than G(5')pppG. An S20, W of 3.8, a Stokes radius of 3.6 nm, and a molecular weight of 56,000 were obtained from sucrose gradient sedimentation and Sephadex G-200 column chromatography.
