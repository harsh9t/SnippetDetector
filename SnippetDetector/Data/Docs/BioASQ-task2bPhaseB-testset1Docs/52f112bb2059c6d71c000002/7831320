After the start of transcription, the 5' ends of eukaryotic mRNA molecules are modified by the addition of a guanylyl residue to form a cap structure, G(5')ppp(5')N. The guanylyltransferase (GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.50) reaction responsible for cap formation usually proceeds via a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. We have studied the alphavirus-specific guanylyltransferase by incubating lysates from Semliki Forest and Sindbis virus-infected cells with [alpha-32P]GTP, using vaccinia virus and mock-infected cells as controls. One additional 32P-labeled protein was detected in alphavirus-infected cells but only in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine. This protein was identified as the nonstructural protein nsP1. The properties of the covalent enzyme-guanylate complex were studied with Semliki Forest virus nsP1 expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected cells. S-Adenosylmethionine and divalent cations were required for the complex formation. The reaction was specific for guanylate nucleotides (GTP, dGTP) and was inhibited by pyrophosphate. nsP1 could be labeled with S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine but only under conditions in which the nsP1-guanylate complex was formed. 7-Methyl-GMP was released from the nsP1-guanylate complex by treatment with acid or acidic hydroxylamine. Similar treatment of vaccinia virus capping enzyme released GMP. These findings suggest that in the capping of alphavirus mRNAs the guanine is methylated before linkage to the mRNA molecule.
