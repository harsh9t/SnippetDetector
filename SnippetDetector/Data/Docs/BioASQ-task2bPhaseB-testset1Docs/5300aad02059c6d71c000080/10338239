Despite the use of protective gear, a 15-year-old hockey player died when he was struck in the chest by a puck. This is the fifth recorded hockey death related to so-called commotio cordis, that is, blunt chest injury without myocardial structural damage. In light of inadequacies of commercial chest protectors currently in use for hockey, the authors hope to educate players and coaches about the danger of blocking shots with the chest. Physicians should be aware that commotio cordis represents a distinctive pathological condition, in the event of which immediate recognition, precordial thump, CPR, and defibrillation are potentially lifesaving. Appropriate medical supervision at amateur hockey games, 911 telephone access, and on-site automated external defibrillators are issues that deserve careful consideration.
