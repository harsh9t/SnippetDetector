CONTENT: Commotio cordis is blunt, nonpenetrating trauma to the chest resulting in irregular heart rhythm and often leading to sudden death. This article presents the epidemiology, variables leading to commotio cordis, theories on predisposing factors, diagnosis, treatment, treatment outcomes, and return-to-play recommendations. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed (MEDLINE) search for commotio cordis was conducted on July 1, 2008, and it yielded 106 results, of which 26 were used for this review, including experimental models, simulation studies, case analysis studies, case reports, general recommendation, review articles, and editorials. RESULTS: There are more than 190 reported cases of commotio cordis in the United States. Forty-seven percent of reported cases occurred during athletic participation. Commotio cordis is the second-most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. Occurrence of commotio cordis is related to time of impact during the cardiac cycle, direct impact over the heart, the hardness and speed of the projectile, and the ineffectiveness of chest barriers. As a result, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends that softer "safety" baseballs be used for youth baseball. Resuscitation using defibrillation was effective in only 15% of cases. Resuscitation within 3 minutes resulted in a survival rate of 25% (17 of 68 cases). Survival drops to 3% when resuscitation is delayed beyond 3 minutes. Survival of commotio cordis has risen from 10% to 15% since 2001. Reduced ventricular ejection fraction has been identified in some commotio cordis survivors. CONCLUSION: Preventive measures, such as using soft "safety" balls and making automated external defibrillators available at sporting venues, can reduce commotio cordis morbidity and mortality. Chest protector designs can be improved to enhance protection. Return to play is best left to clinical judgment given that data are lacking with regard to susceptibility for reoccurrence.

Commotio cordis was described as early as 1763, and it was first systematically evaluated in 1932 by Schlomka and Schmitz.8,18 More than 190 cases have been described in the United States alone. Twenty percent of reported sudden-death cases in young athletes is attributed to Commotio cordis (77 of 387 sudden death cases), second only to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.19 There has been an increase in reported CC cases; of 25 cases reviewed in 1995,22 20 occurred after 1986 and only 5 before 1983. Today, there are more than 180 reported cases in the CC registry. Cases are usually missed because of lack of recognition and consequent underreporting.17
Almost half (47%) of all CC cases occur during competitive sports.4 The age range of the victim is from 7 to 42 years (mean age 15.6 Β± 6.8; Figure 1). Young males, ages 4 to 18 years old, are at greatest risk.7,14,22 Vulnerability in this age group has been attributed to increased chest wall pliability,12 but it is unclear why there is a male predilection.

VF is the most common initial rhythm in CC.22 Link et al studied CC in swine model and reported that VF occurs with a precordial impact during a vulnerable portion of the repolarization upslope of the T wave (10-30 msec before the T-wave peak).15 Another study by Link et al demonstrated that a low-energy impact must occur directly over the heart and that the center of the left ventricle is the most vulnerable.10 In this analysis, left ventricular impacts were more likely to produce VF (7 of 23 strikes, or 30%) than were impacts at other precordial sites (5 of 55, or 9%; P = .02); blows to noncardiac sites did not generate VF (n = 26).
Projectile structure also plays a roleβ€”that is, harder projectiles are more likely to cause CC (Figure 3).3,15 As a result, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends softer β€�safetyβ€� baseballs to decrease the incidence of youth injury.6 Projectile speed is also a factor; velocities of 20 mph do not cause VF, whereas speeds between 30 and 50 mph pose the greatest risk for CC.12 Link et al reported that projectiles traveling 40 mph were most likely to cause VF in swine. Incidents of VF actually decrease when the velocity of the impact is between 50 and 60 mph.12

Current heories
otassium denosine riphosphate and tretch hannel heory. Causative theories on a predisposition to VF include that of mechanical electrical coupling. Studies have also shown that a rapid rise in left ventricular pressure to forces between 250 and 450 mm Hg may mediate electrophysiological consequences.2,7,10,12 Stretch channels may be activated by a specific degree of myocardial stretch.12 Potassium adenosine triphosphate channel activation has also been implicated.16 Glibenclamide was used in a swine model to inhibit these channels, causing attenuation of ST-segment elevation, as well as a reduction of VF incidence. Streptomycin, a blocker of the calcium stretch-sensitive ion channel, did not reduce the frequency of CC, but there was a noted reduction in ST elevation after impact.5Critical Mass TheoryThe critical mass theory suggests that higher-velocity impacts (β‰¥50 mph) are less likely to cause CC, because they lead to myocardial tissue damage, and that viable myocardial tissue is vital in sustaining VF. Higher velocities often produce contusio cordis or myocardial contusion with tissue damage.Autonomic Nervous SystemHypothetically, sympathetic activation that occurs in sports may increase the likelihood of CC. However, a recent study did not substantiate this hypothesis.23

The differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death includes the following: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery abnormalities, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, Marfan syndrome, aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, coronary artery disease, myocarditis, asthma, heat stroke, drug abuse, and a ruptured cerebral artery. These conditions and injuries must be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis of CC can be made. However, a history of witnessed trauma to the chest should immediately raise suspicion of CC. Immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator (AED) protocol is paramount during a witnessed CC event.
Acute Treatment and the Role of AEDEarly defibrillation is critical for survival of CC. Unfortunately, resuscitation after CC is often unsuccessful.14,21,22 In a Link et al swine model, animals that were defibrillated in less than 2 minutes generally survived, whereas among those that were defibrillated in more than 4 minutes, fewer than half survived.9 AED use in animals within 1 to 2 minutes resulted in 100% and 92% success, respectively. Only 46% of shocks were successful after 4 minutes; after 6 minutes, success rates dropped to 25% (P < .0001).9 In human cases, resuscitation within 3 minutes resulted in a survival rate of 25% (17 of 68 cases); when resuscitation was prolonged beyond 3 minutes, the survival rate dropped to 3% (1 of 38 cases).7,21 The total survival rate from CC is approximately 15%,7,21 which has improved from 10% in 2001.13
