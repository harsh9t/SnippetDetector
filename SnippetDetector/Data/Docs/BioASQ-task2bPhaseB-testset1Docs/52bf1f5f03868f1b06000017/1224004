The effect of molindone on the activity of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the rat midbrain and on DA metabolism in the striatum and olfactory tubercles was studied using extracellular single unit recording and biochemical techniques respectively. Molindone in low intravenous doses (0.4-0.8 mg/kg) was found to reverse d-amphetamine and apomorphine induced depression of DA neurons and to block apomorphine induced depression of these cells. Molindone was also found to increase dopamine synthesis and dihydroxyphenylactic acid levels in the striatum and olfacotry tubercles. In all of these respects molindone behaves identically to most classical neuroleptics. However, unlike most antipsychotic drugs previously tested, molindone failed to increase the baseline firing rate of DA cells and blocked haloperidol induced increases in DA neuron activity. In this regard molindone most closely resembles thioridazine and clozapine. Possible mechanisms of action of molindone are discussed based on these findings.
