BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: "In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous". In the present study the anti-hyperglycemic and anti-oxidative potential of aqueous extract of Trigonella foenum graceum (TFG), a traditional medicinal herb was assessed in liver and WBC of alloxan induced diabetic rats. Free radicals can cause oxidative damage, which is balanced by the antioxidants. This has been implicated in aging, and diseases such as diabetes and other chronic conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: TFG extract was administered orally [500 (LM) and 1000 mg/kg body weight (HM)] for six weeks. The effect of TFG on blood glucose were studied and the levels of lipid peroxidation [MDA (Malondialdehyde)] and antioxidant enzymes [SOD (Superoxide dismutase), GPx (Reduced Glutathione peroxidase)] were estimated and compared with standard drugs glibenclamide and insulin. RESULTS: Treatment with TFG, insulin and glibenclamide resulted in significantly reduced blood glucose in LM (8.71%) and HM (3.87%) in comparison with normal controls. There was a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation in liver and white blood cells (WBC) in both low and high doses [liver LM (49%), HM (57.25%)], [WBC LM (54.28%), HM (62.5%)] and increase in antioxidant enzymes SOD [liver LM (33.59%), HM (58.7%)] [WBC LM (44.9%)] HM (58.7%) and GPx [Liver LM (58.55%), HM (40.20%)], [WBC LM (55.46%), HM (56.4%)] when compared to diabetic controls. DISCUSSION: Potency of TFG in restoring several parameters to normal values is comparable to glibenclamide, though not as efficient as insulin, an indication of its antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect.
