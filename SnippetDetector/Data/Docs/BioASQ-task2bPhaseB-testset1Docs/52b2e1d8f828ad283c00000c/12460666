We have investigated the presence of diazoxide- and nicorandil-activated K+ channels in rat skeletal muscle. Activation of potassium transport in the rat skeletal muscle myoblast cell line L6 caused a stimulation of cellular oxygen consumption, implying a mitochondrial effect. Working with isolated rat skeletal muscle mitochondria, both potassium channel openers (KCOs) stimulate respiration, depolarize the mitochondrial inner membrane and lead to oxidation of the mitochondrial NAD-system in a strict potassium-dependent manner. This is a strong indication for KCO-mediated stimulation of potassium transport at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Moreover, the potassium-specific effects of both diazoxide and nicorandil on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria were completely abolished by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, a well-known inhibitor of ATP-regulated potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). Since both diazoxide and nicorandil facilitated swelling of de-energised mitochondria in KSCN buffer at the same concentrations, our results implicate the presence of a mitochondrial ATP-regulated potassium channel (mitoK(ATP) channel) in rat skeletal muscle which can modulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
