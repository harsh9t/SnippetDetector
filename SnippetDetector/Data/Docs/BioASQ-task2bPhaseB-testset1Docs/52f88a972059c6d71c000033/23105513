As antioxidants play a protective role in the pathophysiology of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, understanding the physiological status of antioxidant concentration among people at high risk for developing these conditions, such as Metabolic Syndrome, is of interest. In present study out of 187 first degree non-diabetic relatives and 192 non-diabetic spouses, 33.1% and 19.7% were found to have metabolic syndrome respectively. Subjects with metabolic syndrome (â‰¥3 risk factors) had poor antioxidants status as reflected by significantly low levels of vitamin A, C & E and significantly increased (p<0.01) oxidative stress as compared to those without metabolic syndrome. At the same time serum insulin levels and insulin resistance were found to be significantly high (p<0.001) in metabolic syndrome. A strong positive correlation (r=0.946; p<0.001) between oxidative stress and insulin resistance was observed in metabolic syndrome. Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome suggests that besides therapeutic life style changes (TLC) as suggested in ATP III guidelines inclusion of antioxidant vitamins, fruits and vegetable could be beneficial to ward off the consequences of metabolic syndrome.
