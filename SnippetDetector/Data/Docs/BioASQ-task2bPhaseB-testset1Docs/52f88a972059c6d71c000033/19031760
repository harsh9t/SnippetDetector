OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of migration and oxidative DNA damage by comparative study of oxidative DNA damage effects on people with different years of migration among Xinjiang Hasake ethnicity in Shenzhen. METHODS: Sixty Hasake residents in Shenzhen were selected, and were divided into three groups (n=20) according to the years of migration. Major changes of their life style were investigated. 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) levels in urine were analyzed, and comet assay of peripheral blood lymphocytes conducted. RESULTS: When comparing with the group having a shorter than 1 year of stay,a significant decrease of oliveira tail moment and tail/head length in comet assay in the >3 years group (P < 0.05) was observed 8-OH-dG level decreased significantly in 1-3 years group (P < 0.05) and >3 years group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that life style changes which related to migration might reduce DNA damage in Hasake nationalities.
