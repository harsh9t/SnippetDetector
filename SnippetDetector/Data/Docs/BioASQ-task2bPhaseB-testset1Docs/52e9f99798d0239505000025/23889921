BACKGROUND: The close relationship between epileptic seizure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been demonstrated in the past decade. Valproic acid, a traditional first-line antiepileptic drug, exerted protective effects in transgenic models of AD. It remains uncertain whether new antiepileptic drugs could reverse neuropathology and behavioral deficits in AD transgenic mice. AIMS: APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were used in this study, which over express the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein together with presenilin 1 deleted in exon 9. 7-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were treated daily with 20 mg/kg topiramate (TPM) and 50 mg/kg levetiracetam (LEV) for 30 days by intraperitoneal injection to explore the effects of TPM and LEV on the neuropathology and behavioral deficits. RESULTS: The results indicated that TPM and LEV alleviated behavioral deficits and reduced amyloid plaques in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. TPM and LEV increased Aβ clearance and up-regulated Aβ transport and autophagic degradation. TPM and LEV inhibited Aβ generation and suppressed γ-secretase activity. TPM and LEV inhibited GSK-3β activation and increased the activation of AMPK/Akt activation. Further, TPM and LEV inhibited histone deacetylase activity in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, TPM and LEV might have the potential to treat AD effectively in patient care.
