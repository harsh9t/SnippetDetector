BACKGROUND: Exhausting exercise induces muscle damage associated with high production of free radicals and pro-inflammatory mediators. AIM: The objective of this study was to determine for the first time and simultaneously whether oral coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) supplementation can prevent over-expression of inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress associated with strenuous exercise. METHODS: The participants were classified in two groups: CoQ(10) group (CG) and placebo group (PG). The physical test consisted in a constant run (50 km) that combined several degrees of high effort (mountain run and ultra-endurance), in permanent climbing. RESULTS: Exercise was associated with an increase in TNF-α, IL-6, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and isoprostane levels, revealing the degree of inflammation and oxidative stress induced. Oral supplementation of CoQ(10) during exercise was efficient reducing oxidative stress (decreased membrane hydroperoxides, 8-OHdG and isoprostanes generation, increased catalase, and total antioxidant status), which would lead to the maintenance of the cell integrity. Data obtained also indicate that CoQ(10) prevents over-expression of TNF-α after exercise, together with an increase in sTNF-RII that limits the pro-inflammatory actions of TNF. Moreover, CoQ(10) supplementation reduced creatinine production. CONCLUSIONS: CoQ(10) supplementation before strenuous exercise decreases the oxidative stress and modulates the inflammatory signaling, reducing the subsequent muscle damage.
