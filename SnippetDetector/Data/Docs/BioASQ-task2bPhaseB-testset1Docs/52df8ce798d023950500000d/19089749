The main aim of this investigation was to evaluate the changes in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and aerobic and anaerobic performance induced by supplementation of coffeeberry (CB) formulation for 4 weeks in college athletes. Twenty college athletes (14 males and 6 females) were allocated to two randomly assigned trials. Subjects in the CB group orally ingested capsules that contained CB formulation at a dose of 800 mg per day in two equal doses for 28 days, while subjects in the placebo (P) group ingested an equal number of identical-looking caps that contained cellulose. There were no changes in glucose, cholesterol, and lipoproteins within or between trials (p > 0.05). Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was significantly higher in the CB versus P trial at the post- supplementation trial (1.66 +/- 0.16 vs. 1.51 +/- 0.05 mmol/L; p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant changes in average anaerobic power, index of anaerobic fatigue, maximal heart rate, blood lactate, and maximal oxygen uptake within or between trials (p > 0.05). Heart rate recovery (HRR) index increased significantly in CB group as compared with baseline level (38 +/- 4 vs. 32 +/- 5 beats/min; p < 0.05). Blood lactate after 10 min of recovery (Lact(rec)) significantly decreased in the CB group after supplementation protocol as compared with initial results (7.6 +/- 4.2 vs. 5.5 +/- 2.6 mmol/L; p < 0.05). No subject reported any side effects from CB or P. The results of the present study indicate that supplementation with a CB formulation slightly increased antioxidant capacity, but there were minimal effects on recovery parameters after exercise in college athletes.
