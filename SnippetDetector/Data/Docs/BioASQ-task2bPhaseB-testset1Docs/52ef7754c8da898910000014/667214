There are many procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms in plant kingdom. It is hoped that the study of plant histones will be useful in evolutionary studies. The histones of great variety of animal species have been studied and well characterized. Less information is available concerning plant histones. The general conclusion drawn from these investigations is that most organisms of eucaryotic plant and animal species contain the same five major histone fractions. Recently the histone-like proteins were found in some primitive eucaryotes and procaryotes. Data on histones from higher and lower eucaryotes and histone-like proteins of procaryotes are reviewed. Evolution of histones and their appearance prior to that of eucaryotic cell is postulated. The role of histones in evolution of nucleosomes is discussed.
