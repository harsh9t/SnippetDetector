The prokaryotic protein HU functions as an accessory factor in many different biochemical reactions. We have characterized the role of HU in assembling the invertasome, an intermediate nucleoprotein complex involved in Hin-mediated site-specific recombination. Formation of this complex requires the looping of intervening DNA segments between sites bound by the Hin recombinase and the Fis protein. HU stimulates this process on substrates containing intervening segments of length < 100 bp. Characterization of the activity of HU in Hin-mediated recombination in vitro and in vivo yields evidence that its role in this reaction is primarily to facilitate the looping of the intervening DNA segment. By using this reaction as an assay, we identify proteins from mammals, yeast, trypanosomes, and wheat which can fulfill the same function in vitro. Using ligase-mediated circularization of short DNA fragments we also show that HU, the high mobility group (HMG) 1 and 2 proteins from mammals, and a protein from yeast can bend DNA extremely efficiently. These results support the view that this ubiquitous class of proteins enhance the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes under conditions of limited DNA flexibility.
