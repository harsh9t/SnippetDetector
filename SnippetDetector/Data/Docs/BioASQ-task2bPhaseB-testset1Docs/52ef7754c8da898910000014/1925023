HU is one of the most abundant DNA binding proteins in Escherichia coli. Like the histones, HU is able to condense DNA in vitro and to introduce negative super-coiling in covalently closed circular, relaxed DNA molecules in the presence of topoisomerase I. HU is well conserved in all prokaryotes but surprisingly, it is also homologous to another E. coli DNA-binding protein, IHF. Contrary to HU, IHF shows sequence specificity and is much less abundant that HU. Both are heterodimers and all four polypeptide chains probably arose from a common ancestor. The question we raised was whether IHF could supply the main functions of HU in its absence. The answer seems to be negative for the following reasons. We did not observe any significant regulation of expression of the genes coding for HU by IHF, or vice-versa. The structures that these two proteins form with double-stranded or single-stranded DNA are completely different. Finally, overexpression of IHF does not relieve the growth defects observed in HU-less mutants. However, it can be speculated from our results that even if the two proteins are not equivalent and cannot replace one another, both could stimulate (or inhibit) some specific protein-DNA interactions or affect the DNA-binding properties of one another.
