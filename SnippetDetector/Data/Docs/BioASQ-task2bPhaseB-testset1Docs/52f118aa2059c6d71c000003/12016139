The DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the principle cytotoxic lesion for ionizing radiation and radio-mimetic chemicals but can also be caused by mechanical stress on chromosomes or when a replicative DNA polymerase encounters a DNA single-strand break or other type of DNA lesion. DSBs also occur as intermediates in various biological events, such as V(D)J recombination in developing lymphoid cells. Inaccurate repair or lack of repair of a DSB can lead to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have tumourigenic potential. In other instances, DSBs can be sufficient to induce apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs, eukaryotic cells have evolved complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these lesions, signal their presence and bring about their repair. Here, I provide an overview of these systems, with particular emphasis on the two major pathways of DSB repair: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Inherited or acquired defects in these pathways may lead to cancer or to other human diseases, and may affect the sensitivity of patients or tumour cells to radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies. An increased knowledge of DSB repair and of other DNA DSB responses may therefore provide opportunities for developing more effective treatments for cancer.
