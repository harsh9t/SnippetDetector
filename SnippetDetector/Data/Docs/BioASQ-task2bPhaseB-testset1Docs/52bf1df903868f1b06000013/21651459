INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that opioid antagonists like naltrexone are efficient in reducing heavy drinking. The neurobiological mechanism by which opioid modulators affect drinking behavior is based on the strong connection between the endogenous opioid system, the dopamine system and the influence of the CNS stress response. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the pathophysiological role of the opioid system in alcohol dependence and the neurobiological mechanisms of possible pharmacological interventions. An extensive Medline and Internet research was performed to retrieve information on existing and currently investigated opioid modulators. The findings were assessed critically and interpreted with regard to an individualized therapy for alcohol dependence. EXPERT OPINION: The opioid system is of crucial importance in the genesis and maintenance of alcohol dependence. Naltrexone- and to a lesser extent nalmefene- is an agent that modulates opioidergic transmission in the CNS and it shows a limited but well-studied efficacy in treating alcohol dependence. Several agents (LY2196044, ALKS-29, ALKS-33) that are currently undergoing Phase II and Phase III studies are of interest but first their efficacy must be proved in clinical practice.
