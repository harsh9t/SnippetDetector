Mutations in the human cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT-2). This inherited disorder is characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical and emotional stress in young patients. Here we identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation (K206N) in the CASQ2 gene in a symptomatic family in which one member died of cardiac arrest. The functional properties of CSQ(K206N) were investigated in comparison to the wild-type form of CASQ2 (CSQ(WT)) by expression in eukaryotic cell lines and neonatal mouse myocytes. The mutation created an additional N-glycosylation site resulting in a higher molecular weight form of the recombinant protein on immunoblots. The mutation reduced the Ca(2+) binding capacity of the protein and exhibited an altered aggregation state. Consistently, CSQ(K206N)-expressing myocytes exhibited an impaired response to caffeine administration, suggesting a lower Ca(2+) load of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The interaction of the mutated CSQ with triadin and the protein levels of the ryanodine receptor were unchanged but the maximal specific [(3)H]ryanodine binding was increased in CSQ(K206N)-expressing myocytes, suggesting a higher opening state of the SR Ca(2+) release channel. Myocytes with expression of CSQ(K206N) showed a higher rate of spontaneous SR Ca(2+) releases under basal conditions and after beta-adrenergic stimulation. We conclude that CSQ(K206N) caused a reduced Ca(2+) binding leading to an abnormal regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in myocytes. This may then contribute to the increased propensity to trigger spontaneous Ca(2+) transients in CSQ(K206N)-expressing myocytes.
