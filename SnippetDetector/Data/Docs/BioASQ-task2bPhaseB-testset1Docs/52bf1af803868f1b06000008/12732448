Catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a rare disease that occurs in subjects without obvious organic heart disease, is characterized by episodes of syncope, seizures, or sudden death in response to physiologic or emotional stress. This report reviews evidence that a missense mutation in the CASQ2 gene is associated with autosomal-recessive CPVT.
