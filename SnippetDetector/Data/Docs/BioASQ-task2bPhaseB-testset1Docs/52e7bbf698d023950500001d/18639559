The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of resveratrol, a polyphenol present in grapes and red wine, on ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. After permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery, surviving rats were randomly allocated to three groups and treated with 1 mg/kg/day resveratrol (R-1 group), 0.1 mg/kg/day resveratrol (R-0.1 group), or vehicles (control group) administered by intraperitoneal injection once daily for four weeks. We examined the effects of resveratrol by echocardiography, hemodynamic studies, histologic examinations, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The R-1 group had significantly increased fractional shortening of the left ventricle, ameliorated left ventricular dilatation, reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and reduced infarct size. In contrast, the R-0.1 group experienced no beneficial effects on myocardial infarction. The R-1 group also had significantly attenuated expression of myocardial atrial natriuretic peptide and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNAs. This study indicates that resveratrol is a potent cardioprotective agent in MI rats. Its cardioprotective effects may be due to a reduction of atrial natriuretic peptide and transforming growth factor-beta1, which are known to protect the heart from detrimental remodeling.
