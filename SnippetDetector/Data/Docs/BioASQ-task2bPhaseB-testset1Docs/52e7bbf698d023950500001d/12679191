Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural phytoalexin found in grapes and wine. It has antioxidant and antiproliferative activities, and has been shown to induce NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, also known as DT-diaphorase, in cultured mouse hepatoma cells. DT-diaphorase is a detoxifying enzyme for quinone-containing substances, due to its ability to prevent their one-electron reduction and the consequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oral administration of trans-resveratrol to guinea pigs (60 mg/l in tap water for 16 days, ad libitum) increases cardiac DT-diaphorase and, consequently, reduces the response of isolated atria to 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione), the positive inotropic effect of which is related to the amount of ROS generated by its cardiac metabolism. In the cardiac tissue of resveratrol-treated animals, DT-diaphorase activity was significantly higher than that measured in control animals, the V(max) of the enzyme reaction being 75.47 +/- 3.87 and 50.73 +/- 0.63 nmoles/mg protein/min, respectively (p < 0.05). Resveratrol administration also significantly increased the activity of cardiac catalase (32.20 +/- 2.39 vs. 25.14 +/- 3.85 units/mg protein in treated and control animals, respectively; p < 0.001). As a consequence, menadione metabolism by the cardiac homogenate obtained from resveratrol-treated animals generated a smaller amount of ROS and, in electrically driven left atria, menadione produced a significantly lower increase in the force of contraction than in atria isolated from control animals. These results indicate that oral administration of resveratrol exerts cardioprotection against ROS-mediated menadione toxicity.
