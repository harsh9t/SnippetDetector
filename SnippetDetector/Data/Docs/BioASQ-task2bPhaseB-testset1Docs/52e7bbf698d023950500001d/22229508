Our prior study had shown that resveratrol was a potent cardioprotective agent in rats with myocardial infarction (MI). In this study, we further evaluated the mechanism of cardioprotection of resveratrol by proteomic analysis. After permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery under isoflurane anesthesia, surviving rats were randomly allocated to three groups and treated with resveratrol at 1 mg/kg/day (MI/R group), or vehicles (sham group and MI group) once daily for four weeks. In proteomic analysis, the MI group showed decreased expression of adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) and mitochondrial NADP‚Å∫-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPm) after MI compared with the sham group. These variations were reversed by resveratrol in the MI/R group. Validation with Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses showed similar trends in protein expression profiling. Our studies suggest that the beneficial effects of resveratrol on ventricular modeling may be due to increased expression of AK1 and IDPm, which have been known to increase myocardial energetic efficiency and reduce reactive oxygen species-mediated damage, respectively.
