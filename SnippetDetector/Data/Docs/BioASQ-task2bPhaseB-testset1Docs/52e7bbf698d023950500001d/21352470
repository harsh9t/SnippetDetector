The major problem in stem cell therapy includes viability and engraftment efficacy of stem cells after transplantation. Indeed, the vast majority of host-transfused cells do not survive beyond 24-72 hrs. To increase the survival and engraftment of implanted cardiac stem cells in the host, we developed a technique of treating these cells with resveratrol, and tested it in a rat model of left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion. Multi-potent clonogenic cardiac stem cells isolated from rat heart and stably transfected with EGFP were pre-treated with 2.5 Î¼M resveratrol for 60 min. Rats were anaesthetized, hearts opened and the LAD occluded to induce heart attack. One week later, the cardiac reduced environment was confirmed in resveratrol treated rat hearts by the enhanced expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and redox effector factor-1 (Ref-1). M-mode echocardiography after stem cell therapy, showed improvement in cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening and cardiac output) in both, the treated and control group after 7 days, but only resveratrol-modified stem cell group revealed improvement in cardiac function at the end of 1, 2 and 4 months time. The improvement of cardiac function was accompanied by enhanced stem cell survival and engraftment as demonstrated by the expression of cell proliferation marker Ki67 and differentiation of stem cells towards the regeneration of the myocardium as demonstrated by the expression of EGFP up to 4 months after LAD occlusion in the resveratrol-treated stem cell group. Expression of stromal cell-derived factor and myosin conclusively demonstrated homing of stem cells in the infarcted myocardium, its regeneration leading to improvement of cardiac function.
