OBJECTIVE: The effects of resveratrol treatment on ventricular arrhythmia, survival, and late cardiac remodeling were evaluated in rats with myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: Three groups of rats (S: ham-operated, MI, and MI pre-treated with resveratrol) were treated in an in vivo MI model by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery. The electrocardiogram signals were monitored and recorded for 24 h using an implanted telemetry transmitter. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during the first 24-h after MI was also evaluated. Meanwhile, invasive in vivo electrophysiology with pacing in the right ventricle was performed in each group to assess the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS: Administration of resveratrol significantly suppressed the MI-induced ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (0.4 +/- 0.2 in Resv group vs. 7.1 +/- 2.2 in MI group episodes per hour per rat, P < 0.01). Data also showed that the incidence of inducible ventricular tachycardia was lower in the Resv group than the MI group (46% vs. 81%, P < 0.01). The infarct size and mortality in the Resv group at 14 weeks were reduced by 20% and 33%, respectively, compared with the MI groups. Results from patch clamp recording revealed that resveratrol inhibited L-type calcium current (I (Ca-L)), and selectively enhanced ATP-sensitive K(+) current (I (K,ATP)) in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the emerging anti-arrhythmic character induced by resveratrol treatment in rat hearts could be mainly accounted for by inhibition of I (Ca-L) and enhancement of I (K,ATP). Administration of resveratrol also improved the long-term survival by suppressing left ventricular remodeling.
