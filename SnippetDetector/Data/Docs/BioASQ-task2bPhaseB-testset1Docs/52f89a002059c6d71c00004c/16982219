Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are considered to be a continuum of a neurological sleep disorder associated with abnormal iron metabolism or deficiency. I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis. This is the first case that reports RLS and PLMD manifesting from iron deficiency caused by chronic hemoptysis in advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease.
