BACKGROUND: Cell therapy with bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMCs) can improve recovery of cardiac function after ischemia; however, the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression and modulate the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrated that intramyocardial delivery of BMCs in infarcted mice regulates the expression of cardiac miRNAs and significantly downregulates the proapoptotic miR-34a. In vitro studies confirmed that the supernatant of BMC inhibited the expression of H(2)O(2)-induced miR-34a and cardiomyocytes apoptosis. These effects were blocked by neutralizing antibodies directed against insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Indeed, IGF-1 significantly inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced miR-34a expression, and miR-34a overexpression abolished the antiapoptotic effect of IGF-1. Likewise, inhibition of IGF-1 signaling in vivo abolished the BMC-mediated inhibition of miR-34 expression and the protective effect on cardiac function and increased apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. IGF-1 specifically blocked the expression of the precursor and the mature miR-34a, but did not interfere with the transcription of the primary miR-34a demonstrating that IGF-1 blocks the processing of miR-34a. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data demonstrate that the paracrine regulation of cardiac miRNAs by transplanted BMCs contributes to the protective effects of cell therapy. BMCs release IGF-1, which inhibits the processing of miR-34a, thereby blocking cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
