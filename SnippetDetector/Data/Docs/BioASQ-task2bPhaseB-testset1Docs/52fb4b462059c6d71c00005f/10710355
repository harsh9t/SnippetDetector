Loss of the positive force-frequency relationship is a characteristic finding in failing hearts. The mechanisms of this change are not well understood. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in rabbits to produce left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Beginning 1 day after MI, a subgroup of rabbits received diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) (3.75 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) sc) for 3 wk. We measured contractions, Ca(2+) transients, action potentials, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content at different stimulation rates in single LV myocytes. The shortening-frequency relationship was markedly flattened in MI myocytes compared with control myocytes. In addition, Ca(2+) transients, action potentials, and contractions were prolonged. Myocytes from DITPA-treated MI rabbits had preserved inotropic responses to increased stimulation rate and normal duration of action potentials and Ca(2+) transients. SR Ca(2+) content increased significantly when stimulation rate was increased from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz in control myocytes but did not change significantly in MI myocytes. Myocytes from DITPA-treated MI rabbits had a greater frequency-dependent increase in SR Ca(2+) content compared with the untreated MI rabbits. Thus single myocytes from infarcted rabbit hearts have frequency-dependent abnormalities of contractility, Ca(2+) cycling, and action potential repolarization. The flattened contraction-frequency relationship can be partially explained by an attenuation of the normal enhancement of SR Ca(2+) content that occurs when stimulation rate is increased. Chronic DITPA administration after MI largely prevents the development of these abnormalities.
