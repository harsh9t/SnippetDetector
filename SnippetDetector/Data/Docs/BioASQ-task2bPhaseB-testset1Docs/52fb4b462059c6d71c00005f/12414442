Previous studies from our laboratory and those of others have shown thyroxine to be a stimulator of coronary microvascular growth. The present study tested the hypothesis that 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotopic characteristics, is angiogenic in the nonischemic heart. Daily injections (3.75 mg/kg sc) of DITPA to Sprague-Dawley rats affected protein increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(164), VEGF(188,) basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (FGF-2), angiopoietin-1, and Tie-2 during the first few days of treatment. After 3 wk of treatment, arteriolar length density and the relative number of terminal arterioles (<10 microm diameter) increased in the left ventricle as determined by image analysis of perfuse-fixed hearts. These findings occurred in hearts that did not undergo changes in mass nor in increases in capillary length density. We conclude that DITPA, which is known to improve ventricular function after infarction, is angiogenic in normal nonischemic hearts.
