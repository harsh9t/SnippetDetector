Thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) has many beneficial effects including enhancing cardiac function, promoting weight loss and reducing serum cholesterol. Excess thyroid hormone is, however, associated with unwanted effects on the heart, bone and skeletal muscle. We therefore need analogs that harness the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone without the untoward effects. Such work is largely based on understanding the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, specifically the crystal structure of the nuclear receptor proteins. In clinical studies, use of naturally occurring thyroid hormone analogs can suppress TSH levels in patients with thyroid cancer without producing tachycardia. Many thyromimetic compounds have been tested in animal models and shown to increase total body oxygen consumption, and to lower weight and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels while having minor effects on heart rate. Alternatively, analogs that specifically enhance both systolic and diastolic function are potentially useful in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. In addition to analogs that are thyroid hormone receptor agonists, several compounds that are thyroid hormone receptor antagonists have been identified and tested. This Review discusses the potential application of thyroid hormone analogs (both agonists and antagonists) in a variety of human disease states.
