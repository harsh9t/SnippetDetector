We performed partial evaluation of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) autoantibody profile using the protein array technology. The sera from seven patients with acute PV and five healthy donors were probed for the presence of autoantibodies characteristic of the organ-non-specific autoimmune disorders rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, diabetes and some other autoimmune disorders, but not to desmosomal proteins. The array targeted 785 human genes amplified using Mammalian Gene Clone Collection with gene-specific primers containing 20-bp nucleotide extension complementary to ends of linear pXT7 vector. The array identified PV antibodies significantly (P<0.05) differentially reactive with 16 antigens, most of which were cell-surface proteins, such as CD2, CD31, CD33, CD36, CD37, CD40, CD54, CD66c and CD84 molecules, nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region gamma 2 and others. Reactivity with Fc-IgG helps explain an ability of the chimeric desmoglein constructs to absorb out all disease-causing PV antibodies. Anti-M(1) muscarinic receptor antibody was also identified, consistent with the facts that while blockade of this receptor causes keratinocyte detachment, its activation is therapeutic in PV. Further proteomics analysis of PV antibodies should help elucidate the immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying keratinocyte detachment and blistering.
