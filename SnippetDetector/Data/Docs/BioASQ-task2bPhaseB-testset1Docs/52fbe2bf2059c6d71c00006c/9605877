Using a previously isolated mouse centromere protein A (Cenpa) probe, we have localized the gene to the proximal region of mouse Chromosome 5, between the known Il6 and Yes1 loci near [Adra2C-D5H4S43-Hdh]. Comparison of this localization with that of human CENPA, which maps to chromosome 2, is consistent with the presence of a new region of conserved synteny between the two species.
