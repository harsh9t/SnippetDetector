Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP-2) is a newly discovered member of the PARP family. We report the association of PARP-2 with mammalian centromeres in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, accumulating at centromeres during prometaphase and metaphase, disassociating during anaphase, and disappearing from the centromeres by telophase. Analysis of a pseudodicentric chromosome and a human neocentromere indicates that PARP-2 binding occurs only at active centromeres in a sequence-independent manner. Centromere binding peaks at the outer centromere region, and is significantly enhanced upon treatment with microtubule-inhibiting drugs. Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrates interaction between PARP-2 and its functional homolog PARP-1, constitutive centromere proteins Cenpa and Cenpb, and spindle checkpoint protein Bub3, but not with a third constitutive centromere protein Cenpc. These results, together with our previous demonstration that PARP-1 displays an identical binding pattern with Cenpa, Cenpb and Bub3, but not Cenpc, and that all three proteins undergo significant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation upon gamma-irradiation of cells, point to possible diverse roles of PARP-2 and PARP-1 in modulating the structure and checkpoint functions of the mammalian centromere, in particular during radiation-induced DNA damage.
