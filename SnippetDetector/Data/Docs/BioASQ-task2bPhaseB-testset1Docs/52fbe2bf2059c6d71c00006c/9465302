We have determined the genomic structure and organization of the mouse Cenpa and Cenpc genes. CENPA is a member of the histone H3-like proteins and is thought to replace histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes. CENPC is a DNA-binding protein that is located at the inner kinetochore plate of active mammalian centromeres. The Cenpa cDNA encodes a 134-amino-acid product that is 70% identical and 84% similar to its human homolog. The mouse Cenpa gene is approximately 8 kb in length and contains five exons. Sequence analysis of the 5' DNA sequence of the gene revealed two consensus CAAT boxes, a putative TFIID-binding site, an Sp1-binding domain, and two cell cycle regulatory motifs, but no consensus TATA element. The mouse Cenpc gene spans 60 kb and contains 19 exons that range in size from 44 to 602 bp. Sequence analysis of the C+G-rich promoter region showed the presence of known promoter elements, including a CpG island, a CAAT box, and several GC boxes, but the absence of a consensus TATA element.
