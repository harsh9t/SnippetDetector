DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: GARS-associated axonal neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2D/distal spinal muscular atrophy V [CMT2D/dSMA-V]) is characterized by adolescent or early-adult onset of bilateral weakness and atrophy of thenar and first dorsal interosseus muscles, sparing of the hypothenar eminence until later in the course of illness, and mild to moderate impairment of vibration sense in the hands and feet later in the disease course in a minority of individuals. The phenotype is considered the CMT2D subtype when sensory deficits (reduction of pinprick, temperature, touch, and vibration perception in a stocking and [less often] glove pattern) are present and dSMA-V when sensory deficits are absent. The lower limbs are involved in about half of affected individuals. The earliest elicited manifestations in many individuals are transient cramping and pain in the hands on exposure to cold and cramping in calf muscles on exertion. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of GARS-associated axonal neuropathy is based on clinical findings, electromyography (EMG), and molecular genetic testing of GARS, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Assistive devices for weak hands, ankle support, toe-up braces, ankle-foot orthotics as necessary. Surveillance: Periodic assessment by a neurologist and/or neuromuscular disorders specialist to asses progression of weakness in the limbs and determine the need for prosthetic or assistive devices. GENETIC COUNSELING: GARS-associated axonal neuropathy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with the disorder have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown. Each child of an individual with GARS-associated axonal neuropathy has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal testing is possible if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member.
