Currently used measures to assess kidney function and injury are largely inadequate. Markers such as serum creatinine, formulas to estimate glomerular filtration rate, cystatin C, and proteinuria largely identify an underlying disease process that is well established. Thus, there has been a recent effort to identify new biomarkers that reflect kidney function, early injury, and/or repair that ultimately can relate to progression or regression of damage. Several biomarkers emerged recently that are able to detect kidney damage earlier than is currently possible with traditional biomarkers such as serum creatinine and proteinuria. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine. Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention. The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. In this article, we focus on the applications of these biomarkers in disease.
