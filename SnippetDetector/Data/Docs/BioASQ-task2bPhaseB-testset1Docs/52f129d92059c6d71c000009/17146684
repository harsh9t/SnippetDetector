<abstract>
A new mutation of the CD40LG gene that encodes the CD40 ligand molecule was characterized in a young patient harboring a hyper-IgM with immunodeficiency syndrome. Inactivation of CD40LG gene resulted from the insertion of an AluYb8 element in exon 1 responsible for a total deficiency of CD40 ligand expression by T lymphocytes. Maternal transmission of the X-linked mutation was confirmed by gene-specific polymerase chain reaction. This is the 17th case report concerning a human genetic disease caused by an Alu element insertion in a coding sequence.
