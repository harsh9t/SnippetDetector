PURPOSE: Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathy caused by mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene. It is characterized by insidious onset with a selective degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, variable loss of visual acuity, temporal optic nerve pallor, tritanopia, and development of central, paracentral, or cecocentral scotomas. Here we describe the clinical and molecular findings in a large Italian family with ADOA. METHODS: Routine ophthalmologic examination and direct sequencing of all coding regions of the OPA1 gene were performed. Further characterization of a new OPA1 gene insertion was performed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of RNA from patients and control subjects. RESULTS: We identified an Alu-element insertion located in intron 7 of OPA1 causing an in-frame deletion of exon 8 in 18 family members. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted consequence of this mutation is the loss of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of OPA1. Alu insertions have been reported in the literature as causing human genetic disease. However, this is the first report of a pathogenic OPA1 gene mutation resulting from an Alu insertion.

Introduction
utosomal dominant optic atrophy (;  165500) is the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathy, with an estimated prevalence between 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 in different populations [1]. t is characterized by insidious onset with a selective degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, variable loss of visual acuity, temporal optic nerve pallor, tritanopia, and development of central, paracentral, or cecocentral scotomas [2].  is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with high interfamilial and intrafamilial phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance.
utations in the optic atrophy 1 (1) gene (that consists of 30 coding exons) are responsible for approximately 90% of cases. 1 encodes a large guanosine triphosphatase (ase), implicated in the formation and maintenance of the mitochondrial network [3] and in protection against apoptosis by segregating cytochrome c inside the mitochondrial cristae [4]. 1 comprises a highly basic -terminus, a dynamin ase domain, and a -terminus. ore than 200 pathogenic mutations have been reported in the literature (see the e. OPA1 database). No significant correlation has been observed between degree of visual impairment and location or type of mutation [5]. Missense mutations in OPA1, however, leading to multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions in skeletal muscle and a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase, were recently found. In these cases the disorder presented with visual failure and optic atrophy in childhood, followed by Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ataxia, deafness, and sensory-motor neuropathy in adulthood. Moreover, some cases show additional neurologic symptoms, the so-called optic atrophy plus phenotypes [6].

Methods
amily study. Twenty-eight individuals of a single large Italian family were recruited from the Department of Neurologic, Neurosurgical and Behavioral Sciences of Siena, the Italian Union of the Blind of Siracusa and the Department of Pediatric of Catania. There were 15 females and 13 males ranging in age from 9 to 59 years. We use the term β€�familyβ€� to indicate descendants of a multigenerational pedigree of related individuals (Figure 1). Autosomal dominant inheritance was indicated by multiple affected individuals in each generation. All patients underwent routine ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, color vision, manual visual field, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), and dilated fundoscopy. Clinical neurologic examination and genetic analysis was also performed in all patients.Figure 1Pedigree diagram of the Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA) family. The pedigree of a five-generation family shows eighteen affected members. Solid squares mean male patients, open circles mean normal females, solid circles mean female patients, open squares mean normal males, arrow means proband (V-3). Oblique lines through circles and squares represent deceased, vertical lines indicate the presence of the mutation in two unaffected family members (IV-7 and IV-10) and in another family member not available for ophthalmological examination (V-15).Mutation analysisAfter informed consent was obtained, 5Β ml of blood from the proband, his family members, and healthy controls, was drawn into an ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) sample tube and preserved (frozen). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using a QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen, Limburg, Netherlands). All 30 coding exons (comprising intronβ€“exon boundaries) were amplified by PCR using primers specific for OPA1 (Table 1). PCR reactions were performed in 25Β ΞΌl reaction volumes containing 100 ng genomic DNA, 10 pmol forward and reverse primers, 100Β mM dNTPs, 1U DNA polymerase (Eurotaq DNA polymerase; Euroclone, Milan, Italy), 1.5Β mM MgSO4, 1Γ— Reaction buffer, using a DNA thermal cycler (PTC-200; MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The PCR products of exon 8 were cloned into a PCR Cloning Vector pSC-A using the Strata Cloneβ„Ά PCR Cloning Kit (Agilent Technologies, Stratagene Products Division, Santa Clara, CA). After purification of PCR products with QIAquick PCR Purification kits (Qiagen), sequencing was performed using the automated sequencer ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Table 1DNA sequence of oligonucleotides used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Amplified fragmentForward primer (5β€²-3β€²)Reverse primer (5β€²-3β€²)PCR length (bp)Annealing temperature Β°CPromotorCATGGCTAGTACGGATGTAATTGGAGAAACTAACCACCATCA25055Exon 1TGTTTCCGTGACGGACTGAGTACCTGAGAGTCACCTGCACATTT33056Exon 2TCCTTTGTACTGTTACCCTCTCCTAGTCCATGGTAGAGACACAA53054Exon 3CATTATTCTTAGTAGATTAATGTGAAACAGTTAGTGGCAGCTGTGG34056Exon 4GTAGGGTTGTCATGAGGATTAACCTCCATGGTTCTTAAATTT27054Exon 4bGAAATCTGAGATCTCAGACATCTGGTCTGCAATTTTATTTGCAAC25057Exon 5TCAGCTTAGGCTGTTGACATCACCCAGAACTGCCACGTAATACCT30062Exon 5bTCCCTAGCTTACATCTGTTCCTTGGCAGAAATGGCTGATTAGTG27057Exon 6GCAACAGGGAAATGATTGCCTTAGGTTCTATCATTACACCTTCC41056Exon 7AGGAGATATGACTTCAAGATTTTGGCCATCCTCCAAGCACATTAGGTT35057Intron 7AGGAGATATGACTTCAAGATTTTGGCATGTTTGTTAAGCTAGAACTG90056Intron 7CTGCAGTAAATCATGGCATGTGAGAGAGAAAGAGAGAGGACAG65052Intron 7CAGTGGATACTTAACCACCCGAGAACATCAAGAACTTCAG45054Exon 8CTCTTGACACATCTGTTATATTGCCTACATCTAGTATGTATA27052Exon 9CTCAGAGCAGCATTACAAATAGGAACACAATGAACAGGTCTCACTG25057Exon 10CAATGCAGTAGCCCTGTCTAGAGGCTAACGGTACAGCCTTCTTT38062Exon 11GATAGTTCTCGGGAGTTTGATCGCTCTACATATCTAGATAGCAGC36062Exon 12 and 13GTCTTATCTGAATGGATGAGGCAAAGCTTGGATTGCTAAAGAAG42057Exon 14CTTGCTATAATGTAGACACAGGGAAATCCCTATCACAGCTGGAGC30062Exon 15 and 16TAGGCAGCAGAGCAGGAATTCACAGTTCAATTTAAGCTACTCTC40056Exon 17AGCACATTCGCAGACTTGGTGGTAGTATGGATGCCAAAGATTGCCAGC26068Exon 18CCACTTTAACCACTACATCTGGGAGATAACTGCTCCTAGAGATG30062Exon 19CCTCCCTTTGGTTATCTCTGAAGCCTATGAGCCAAGGCAACAATAAAT27054Exon 20CTTGACTGGTGCGATTTACAGGGAAAGATAGAGGCTGTGATGGG43060Exon 21CTGTTTGGCTTGAGCTCGTGTTTGAGGCTGATACCCCAGTATAC43062Exon 22GGGCCAGGAGAGAATCTCCACTTGGATGACTCCTTCACCACTGT35062Exon 23CTGCCTTCATATTGATATAGCACATTCCTGAGACTGGTCTAGAGC30054Exon 24TTTACCATATTCATAAGCCGGGTGTCAGCAAATGTACACGTGAC45060Exon 25CTTCTCAGTGTGGTTGATCAACCCCCAGATGATCAAAGGACTTA30050Exon 26CTGGTTCTAGTAGTTGTATGTGAGCTACCACACCTGGCCAGTTT35056Exon 27GCACTTCCATTAAAGTGTATAGCACAAATGGAAATGGGAAAGGTGG42062Exon 28AAGGTGGTATGGTGAGACTCATTACAGCATAAGTGACAAGCAGG35062Reverse Transcriptaseβ€“PCR analysisPeripheral blood, about 10Β ml, was collected using vacutainer EDTA tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) from the proband (V-3, Figure 1), the probandβ€™s mother (IV-8, Figure 1) and three healthy controls.

Results
linical findings in carriers of mutations. Neurologic examination was unremarkable (Table 2). Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity ranging from 20/20 to less than 20/200. Color vision was normal in two subjects, the other 16 had different degrees of color sensitivity deficiency (eight of them showed generalized color sensitivity deficit). IOP with applanation was in the normal range in 11 patients (not exceeding 19β€“20Β mmHg); four subjects had IOP over 20Β mmHg. One patient had high IOP (40Β mmHg). Optic nerve appearance was normal in two subjects, whereas nine showed temporal pallor and six diffuse neurorim pallor.Table 2Patients clinical findings.CaseAgeVisual acuityColor vision IshiharaIOP applanation (mmHg)OphthalmoscopyΒ Β RELERELERELERELEIII-35920/4020/502/1518diffuse neurorim pallor C/D 0.3III-958<20/200generalized deficit16temporal pallor C/D 0.6β€“0.7III-1156<20/200generalized deficit20optic atrophy C/D 0.6β€“0.7III-1351<20/200generalized deficit14temporal pallor C/D 0.6β€“0.7IV-441<20/20020/1503/154012optic atrophy C/D 0.6subatrophy C/D 0.4IV-72020/2015/1521>cupping C/D 0.5β€“0.6IV-83820/2012/1515/151922slight temporal pallor C/D 0.5β€“0.6cupping CD0.6β€“0.7IV-103620/2015/15normalnormalIV-223320/4020/70generalized deficit14temporal pallor C/D 0.6β€“0.7IV-2625<20/200generalized deficit16temporal pallor C/D 0.3β€“0.4IV-2727<20/200generalized deficit16temporal pallor C/D 0.3β€“0.4IV-284120/704/151617diffuse neurorim pallor C/D: 0.4IV-304820/7020/100generalized deficit15normal cuppingV-11020/404/15nptemporal pallor C/D 0.3V-3920/100generalized deficitnptemporal pallor C/D 0.7V-121220/2015/15normalslight temporal pallor.

We did not find any known pathogenic mutation, but amplification of exon 8 revealed a hemizygous product of about 604 bp (Figure 2, A). Cloning and sequencing of the longer band revealed an insertion of about 325 bp. Using BLAST and Repeat Masker [7] to elucidate the nature of the inserted fragment, we identified 289 bp of the insert as belonging to AluYb8 (99.65% homology with Alu Sb2). The Alu insert was composed of a 289-bp fragment and contained a 25-bp poly(A) tail at its 3β€² end with perfect direct repeats of 17 bp flanking the insert (Figure 2B,C). In Figure 2C RNA polymerase III promoter (A and B boxes) and the consensus target site sequence are also indicated. The same mutation was found in 17 family members (Figure 1); in ten subjects the mutation was absent, and the analysis was not performed in the remaining family members. The Alu insertion was located in intron 7 of OPA1, 21 bp upstream of exon 8, near the acceptor site (C.784β€“21_22). The mutation caused the skipping of exon 8 in mRNA (Figure 2D,E).Figure 2OPA1 mutation in the Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA) family.

Discussion
n the case reported here, we found an unusual molecular defect in 1 causing  in a large talian family. he defect is the result of an lu element insertion.
lu sequences are the most frequent, short, interspersed elements in the human genome, numbering 1.1 million copies and more than 10% of the mass of the genome. lu elements are sequences of approximately 300 nucleotides flanked by perfect direct repeats of the host sequence, consistent with insertion into staggered nicks in the target  [8]. lu and other repetitive elements have had great influence on the human genome and its evolution [9]. hey influence m. RNA splicing, RNA editing, and protein translation [10]. Not surprisingly, Alu insertions have been associated with several human genetic disorders. A total of 26 L1 trans-driven Alu insertions have so far been described as causes of diseases [11].
In our case the Alu element was inserted in the antisense direction with respect to OPA1. Alu element insertions in introns can have strong effects on gene expression, especially when inserted in the antisense direction. Five reports indicate that Alu insertions into intronic sequences in antisense orientation and close to the affected exon (19β€“50 nucleotides) cause the downstream exon to shift from constitutive splicing to full exon skipping or alternative splicing. Three have been found to cause skipping of downstream exons: one impairs correct recognition of the splice acceptor site (F8 gene) [12], while the other two may affect the branch site that is usually very close to the end of the intron (NF1 and TNFRSF6 genes) [13,14]. The orientation and position of the Alu in the upstream intron was recently studied. Lev-Maor et al. shed light on the positive and negative effects of Alu elements inserted in antisense orientation immediately upstream of the regulated exon [15].
In our case Alu insertion probably interferes with the branch site leading to production of an alternatively spliced mRNA lacking exon 8. Loss of this exon may be similar to that reported for Alu element insertion in NF1 and TNFRSF6 genes.
A consensus target site is probably generated in the antisense strand where integration of the retroposon begins: the first 5β€²-gtAAAA-3β€² hexanucleotides (3β€²CAβ†“TTTT 5β€²) of the 17-bp target-site duplication flanking the Alu element matches one of the more frequent consensus sequences perfectly [16]. The sense strand is nicked 17 bp from gtAAAA [17].
Phenotypic expression of this new mutation did not show particular peculiarities since ophthalmologic variability observed in our patients has also been described in other common OPA1 mutations. Moreover, the presence of the mutation in two unaffected family members suggests incomplete penetrance, as previously reported for other OPA1 gene mutations [18].
In conclusion, we describe an AluYb8 [8] retrotransposition event in an intron of the OPA1 gene leading to exon skipping. The predicted consequence of this mutation is the loss of the GTPase activity of OPA1. Alu insertions have been reported in the literature as causing human genetic disease. However, this is the first report of a pathogenic OPA1 gene mutation resulting from an Alu insertion.
