Aging-associated decline in androgen levels is associated with risks of age-related disorders such as sarcopenia and disability in older adults. However, several clinical trials with androgen replacement therapy have failed to show clinical benefit. Recently, it has been reported that exercise could enhance intrinsic androgen levels, explaining one of the mechanisms of the beneficial effects induced by exercise.
