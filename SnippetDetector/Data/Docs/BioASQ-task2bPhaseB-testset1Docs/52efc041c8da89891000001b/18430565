Thyroid hormone has various effects on the cardiovascular system and its effects on cardiac contractility, heart rhythm and vascular function has long been recognized. However, new evidence is emerged on the importance of thyroid hormone in the response of the myocardium to ischaemic stress and cardiac remodelling following myocardial infarction. Based on this new information, this review highlights the role of thyroid hormone in myocardial ischaemia and cardiac remodelling, the possible underlying mechanisms and the potential therapeutic implications. Thyroid hormone or analogs may prove new therapeutic agents for treating ischaemic heart disease.
