The present study explored the effects of thyroid hormone (TH) treatment on post-ischemic cardiac function and potential implicated mechanisms. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was induced in mice by coronary artery ligation while sham-operated animals served as controls. This procedure resulted in a marked depression of cardiac function and significant reduction in TH levels in plasma. TH was given at a dose aiming to normalize T3 levels in plasma [AMI-TH (A)] and also at higher doses. The group of animals treated with the highest dose of TH, which displayed significantly increased mortality rate was included in the study [AMI-TH (B)]. In AMI-TH (A) mice, TH significantly improved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF%), [27.9% (1.4) in AMI versus 38.0 (3.1) in AMI-TH (A), P < 0.05], and favorably remodeled LV chamber while Î±-MHC was the dominant isoform expressed. In AMI-TH (B) mice, TH treatment resulted in increased mortality as compared to untreated mice (73% vs 47%, P < 0.05), while the favorable effect of TH was not evident in the survived animals. At the molecular level, TH, at the replacement dose, modestly increased p-Akt levels in the myocardium without any change in p-ERK levels. On the contrary, TH at the higher dose resulted in further increase in p-Akt along with an increase in p-ERK levels. In conclusion, TH appears to have a dose-dependent bimodal effect on post-ischemic cardiac performance and this effect may, at least in part, be mediated by a distinct pattern of activation of Akt and ERK signaling.
