Dermatoglyphics of 11 patients with Wilson's disease and 16 of their clinically asymptomatic relatives of first degree were investigated; 11 of the latter ones were heterozygous in agreement with the turn over rates of Cu-67, 12 under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance. On the finger tips the Mb. Wilson patients showed 52.7% whorls, their heterozygous relatives about 40%; compared with our controls (males 33.16%, females 28.82%, Aue-Hauser, 1970) that means a strong increase of this pattern type. On the palm the high frequency of hypothenar patterns in homo- and heterozygotes for Wilson's disease and of loops with accessory triradius in the 4th interdigitum of the patients with Wilson's disease was striking.
