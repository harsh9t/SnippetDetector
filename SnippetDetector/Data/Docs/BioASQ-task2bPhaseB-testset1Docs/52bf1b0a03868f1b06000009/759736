Fifty-eight patients with Wilson's disease are reviewed, of whom 25 symptomatic patients experienced liver disease first and 28, brain disease. Ten of these patients presented with liver disease alone, 19 with brain disease alone, and 24 with evidence of both liver and brain disease. The remaining five were discovered as asymptomatic siblings of known patients. Three of the patients with hepatic presentation and one with neurologic presentation later experienced the other type of symptomatology, bringing the total number of patients with mixed disease to 28. Of the 44 patients with brain disease, 12 presented primarily with extrapyramidal findings, 6 with cerebellar findings, and 17 with both; pseudobulbar findings were noted in 9 patients, all of whom had other symptoms of severe nervous system disease. In addition to these presentations, in an appreciable number of patients the first symptoms were of a mental or emotional disorder. Disease of other organ systems, such as the joints and kidneys, also occurred but infrequently. Where adequate family information was available, 13 of 65 siblings (20%) were known to have had or were suspected of having had Wilson's disease. This is consistent with the autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance.
