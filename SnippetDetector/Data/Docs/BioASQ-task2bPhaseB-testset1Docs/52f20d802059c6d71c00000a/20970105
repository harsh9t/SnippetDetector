In human mitochondria, polyadenylation of mRNA, undertaken by the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial poly(A) RNA polymerase, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial gene expression. Our molecular investigation of an autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia with optic atrophy, present among the Old Order Amish, identified a mutation of MTPAP associated with the disease phenotype. When subjected to poly(A) tail-length assays, mitochondrial mRNAs from affected individuals were shown to have severely truncated poly(A) tails. Although defective mitochondrial DNA maintenance underlies a well-described group of clinical disorders, our findings reveal a defect of mitochondrial mRNA maturation associated with human disease and imply that this disease mechanism should be considered in other complex neurodegenerative disorders.
