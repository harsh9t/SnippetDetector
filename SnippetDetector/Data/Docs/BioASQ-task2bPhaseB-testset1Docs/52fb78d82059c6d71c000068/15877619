Brugada syndrome is an inherited cardiac disorder caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit, which can lead ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Inattentive use of antiarrhythmic drugs potentially triggers fatal cardiac arrhythmias through further reduction of sodium current (I(Na)). We studied the molecular mechanism underlying a case of Brugada syndrome that showed no response to a class Ic antiarrhythmic drug. Molecular genetic studies of a patient with Brugada syndrome identified a novel mutation in SCN5A, which causes substitution of serine for asparagine (N406S) in S6 of domain I (IS6). The provocation test with pilsicainide, a class Ic antiarrhythmic drug, failed to exacerbate ST-segment elevation in this case. Electrophysiological analyses of the N406S-mutant channel expressed together with the beta1 subunit in HEK293 cells showed that the voltage dependence of activation was positively shifted by 16 mV and that intermediate inactivation was enhanced. Whereas tonic block by pilsicainide was not changed in the N406S channel, use-dependent block by pilsicainide was almost completely abolished, consistent with the clinical findings of the negative provocation test. In contrast, the N406S channel showed stronger use-dependent block by quinidine than the wild-type channel. We demonstrate a novel Brugada mutation N406S, which is associated with the discordant effects on blocking actions of antiarrhythmic drugs as well as the multiple channel gating defects. We emphasis that an antiarrhythmic drug may exert unpredicted effects in patients with channel mutations.
