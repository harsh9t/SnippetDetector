<abstract>
Andersen's syndrome is a clinically distinct form of potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis associated with cardiac dysrhythmias. The subtle nature of the cardiac and dysmorphic features may delay the recognition of this syndrome and its potentially lethal cardiac dysrhythmias. The genetic defect in Andersen's syndrome is not genetically linked to other forms of potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis and is probably distinct from the long QT syndrome locus.
