Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is an autosomal dominant or sporadic disorder characterized by periodic paralysis, dysmorphic features, and ventricular arrhythmias. Although ventricular tachycardia burden is quite high sudden cardiac death in ATS is rare. We describe a case with sudden cardiac death due to electrical storm a few days after ICD implantation in KCNJ2 mutation-negative ATS.
