With an ageing population and improving cancer therapies, the two most common benign and malignant bone diseases, osteoporosis and bone metastases, will continue to affect an increasing number of patients. Our expanding knowledge of the molecular processes underlying these conditions has resulted in novel bone targets that are currently being explored in clinical trials. Clearly, the approval of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL, has just marked the beginning of a new era for bone therapy with several additional new therapies lining up for clinical approval in the coming years. Potential agents targeting the osteoclast include cathepsin K, currently in phase 3 trials, and src inhibitors. Amongst anabolic agents, inhibitors of the Wnt-inhibitor sclerostin and dickkopf-1 are promising in clinical trials. Here, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the most promising agents currently explored for the treatment of bone diseases.
