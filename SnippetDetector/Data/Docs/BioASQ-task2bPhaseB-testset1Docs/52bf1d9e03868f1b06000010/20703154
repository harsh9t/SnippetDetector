PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Treatment and prevention of bone metastases is a major problem in patients with cancer. New treatment of bone metastases are needed to maintain the quality of life of our patients with metastastic bone disease. In addition, promising preliminary results suggest that bone-directed therapies may be able to prevent both skeletal and extraskeletal metastases RECENT FINDINGS: For the past decade intravenous bisphosphonates have been the mainstay of treatment of patients with bone metastases. New therapies such as the antibody to RANKL (denosumab) are undergoing phase III clinical testing. In addition, confirmatory studies suggesting that bisphosphonates can prevent metastatic disease are underway. SUMMARY: Understanding the biology of bone metastases has uncovered many new potential therapies for the treatment and prevention of bone metastases. Many of these potential new approaches are discussed in the enclosed article.
