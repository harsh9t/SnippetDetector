The skeletal and immune systems have a complex relationship. Both systems are intimately coupled, with osteoclastogenesis and hematopoiesis occurring in the bone marrow. Bone and immune cells also share common hematopoietic precursors. Furthermore, the skeletal and immune systems share various cytokines, receptors, and transcription factors that regulate signal transduction pathways involved in osteoclastogenesis and immune system activation, including the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ ligand/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ/osteoprotegerin (RANKL-RANK-OPG) pathway. Cancer cells can disrupt both the skeletal and immune systems. Interaction between cancer and bone cells results in a vicious cycle of bone destruction and cancer growth. Bone remodeling generates a growth-factor-rich environment that attracts cancer cells and promotes their proliferation. In turn, cancer cells stimulate osteoclast formation and activity, resulting in additional bone resorption that further stimulates cancer cell growth. Currently available bone-targeted therapies may also modulate the immune system. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid exert stimulating effects on the immune system, resulting in possible anticancer activity against malignant cells. Denosumab, an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody with proven antiosteoclast activity, may suppress immune responses. This may result in the reported association with an increased risk of neoplasms, as well as serious skin and other infections as reported in some studies, mainly in the postmenopausal setting. When assessing bone-targeted therapies, it is important to consider the shared signaling pathways between bone and the immune system, as well as the clinical risk:benefit ratio.
