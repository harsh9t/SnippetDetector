Calstablin2 stabilises the ryanodine receptor (RyR2), preventing aberrant activation of the channels during the resting phase of the cardiac muscle. Loss of this stabilisation may be associated with cardiac arrhythmias, the sudden death occasionally observed in people with structurally normal hearts, as well as the atrial fibrillation in heart failure. Calstabin2-deficient mice have structurally normal hearts but exhibit exercise-induced cardiac ventricular arrhythmias that cause sudden death. In arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2-/- mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2+/- mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstablin2. Familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in humans has been linked to missense mutants in the hRyR2 gene. In HEK293 cells, these RyR2 mutants showed less binding of 35S-calstabin2 than the wild type, indicating a reduced binding affinity. In human atrial fibrillation and heart failure, where there is excessive disassociation of calstabin2 from the RyR2 receptor in vitro, JTV519 is able to reverse this. In conclusion, calstabin2 is an important new target in sudden cardiac death associated with structurally normal hearts, and in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
