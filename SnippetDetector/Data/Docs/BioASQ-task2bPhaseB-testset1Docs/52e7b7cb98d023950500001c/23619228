The rapidly increasing number of people with obesity and type 2 diabetes is one of the most serious problems of the contemporary world. Until recently, it was thought that the main cause of this phenomenon is the change of lifestyle and dietary habits. According to recent reports, the gut microbiota may also play an important role in the "epidemic" of obesity and diabetes. Changes in its composition have been observed in people suffering from these diseases. In addition, the fact that the intestinal microbiota may affect body weight, insulin sensitivity or sugar and lipid metabolism has led to the hypothesis that these changes may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. Scientists, using antibacterial drugs, pro- and prebiotics, are trying to modify the intestinal flora and thus affect its interaction with the host. The results are very promising, lead to further analysis and indicate gut microbiota as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes treatment.
