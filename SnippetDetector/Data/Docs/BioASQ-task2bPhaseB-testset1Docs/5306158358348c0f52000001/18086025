BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder caused by genetic defects in certain regions of chromosome 15q11-13. It is characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems, childhood-onset hyperphagia and obesity, short stature, facial dysmorphy, hypogonadism, learning and behavioural difficulties, and dental abnormalities. AIM: To describe the oro-dental phenotypic spectrum of patients with PWS. DESIGN: Fifteen PWS patients (3-35 years of age) being followed at the Centre for Human Genetics of the University Hospital of Leuven were examined at the dental clinic of the same institution. Medical information collected included age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) and level of cognitive functioning. Oral, clinical and radiological evaluations were performed. Caries experience (cavitation level), dental erosion and salivary flow rates were assessed. RESULTS: The 15 patients had dmft/DMFT scores ranging from 0 to 28, while nine were cavity-free. Those with severe caries experience also presented advanced dental erosion. BMI ranged from 16 to 42.6. There was no association between BMI and caries experience or erosive tooth wear. The PWS patients in our survey presented with a more favourable oral health status than those in previous studies. This might be due to early diet management or better oral hygiene during childhood or both.
