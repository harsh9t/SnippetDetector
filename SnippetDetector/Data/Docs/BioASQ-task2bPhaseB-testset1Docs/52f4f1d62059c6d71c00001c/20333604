HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 55-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with signs of cerebral ischaemia i. e. dysarthria and weakness of the buccal branch of the facial nerve. Additionally the patient reported symptoms of heart failure NYHA class II. Six months earlier the patient also had visual disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had shown ischaemic lesions. INVESTIGATIONS: A recent MRI confirmed the suspected diagnosis of ischaemia in the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. The echocardiography was characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25 %) due to isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC). TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with a combination therapy including ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. An oral anticoagulation was recommended as secondary prophylaxis. At the time of discharge the patient had no residual neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events, arrhythmias and heart failure. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice in identifying characteristic changes.
