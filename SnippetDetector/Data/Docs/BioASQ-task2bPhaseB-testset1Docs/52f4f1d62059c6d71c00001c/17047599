Non-compaction of the left ventricle or spongy myocardium is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy which is characterized by impaired endomyocardial morphogenesis, hypertrophy of left ventricular myocardium with prominent trabeculation, and deep inter-trabecular recesses. According to WHO classification (1995) this disease belongs to unclassified cardiomyopathies. Main clinical signs of ventricular non-compaction are heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, systemic and pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography which is a basic method of diagnosis can reveal double layer structure of thickened left ventricular wall and multiple prominent trabeculation with wide inter-trabecular spaces. Predominant localizations of pathological process are region of cardiac apex, inferior and lateral left ventricular walls. Treatment of patients with ventricular non-compaction concentrates on elimination of its main clinical symptoms.
