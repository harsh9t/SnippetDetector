Acute rejection episodes are now as low as 5-20% in the first year after renal transplantation; however, graft half-life has remained almost unchanged in the last decade. This statistic is mainly attributable to the side effects of immunosuppression, with loss of allografts due to the chronic allograft nephropathy that is a consequence of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity or hypertension. Patient death due to cardiovascular events, infections and malignancy also contribute to allograft loss. The introduction of the inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin sirolimus and everolimus in renal transplantation has increased the repertoire of immunosuppressive protocols substantially. They have a different mode of action and a different side effect profile (i.e. lower nephrotoxicity, less hypertension and less neoplastic potential) than the calcineurin inhibitors. The inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin therefore provide an especially promising alternative for the maintenance immunosuppression after renal transplantation. This overview provides a summary of the current literature on inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin, with a special focus on sirolimus.
