Targeted therapies are widely used in cancer because of their effectiveness, even in tumours that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy such as kidney or hepatocellular carcinomas. There are different families classified according to their mode of action. The antiangiogenics block tumor angiogenesis by acting on VEGF or its receptor. The main molecules are bevacizumab, sunitinib, and sorafinib. HER inhibitors work by blocking these receptors, which control different signaling intracellular pathways, and include an inhibitor of HER2, trastuzumab, and various inhibitors of HER1, or EGFR, including cetuximab, erlotinib, and gefitinib. Inhibitors of KIT, a membrane receptor, are mainly represented by imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase. Finally, mTOR inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus.
