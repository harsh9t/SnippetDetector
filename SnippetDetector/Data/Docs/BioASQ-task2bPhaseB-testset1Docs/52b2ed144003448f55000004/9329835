PGD has been successfully used for several years. Over 40 babies have been born worldwide by use of these techniques. Unfortunately, a number of misdiagnoses have been made, a distressing consequence of a new frontier. Significant advances have been made to improve the efficiency and accuracy of PCR and FISH. The widespread use of this technology awaits further documentation of safety and accuracy. Other issues must also be addressed. First, the cost-effectiveness of the techniques relative to the traditional alternatives must be evaluated. A number of ethical issues regarding embryo screening must be addressed including what diseases are serious enough to warrant the procedure. Another concern is the use of this technology for nongenetic disorders such as gender selection. Finally, the experimental nature of these procedures must continually be discussed with patients, and long-term follow-up studies must be undertaken. Development of more accurate and less expensive assays coupled with improved IVF success rates may make PGD a more widely used clinical tool. The future awaits these developments.
