<abstract>
Both genetic and environmental factors affect susceptibility, severity and probably drugs' efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). After initial completion of the Human Genome Project on the 16th February 2001, significant progress has been made in identifying other than HLA genome regions linked to the increased RA susceptibility. As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors, whereas STAT 4, CTLA4, PADI4 and IRF5 genes polymorphisms are listed among probable RA development genetic risk factors.
