Accumulating evidence suggests that genes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid pathway influence susceptibility to hypertension. Type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase is responsible for the conversion of thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine for use in peripheral tissues. The present study evaluated whether a type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase nonsynonymous polymorphism, threonine 92 to alanine (Thr92Ala), is a determinant of hypertension susceptibility. A total of 372 euthyroid subjects were genotyped for Thr92Ala polymorphism using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Associations with hypertension and hypertension-related intermediate phenotypes were performed with generalized estimating equations. Type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase Thr92Ala allele frequencies differed significantly between hypertensive and normotensive subjects, with an excess of Ala92 carriers in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects (64.8% versus 47.1%; P=0.011). Adjusted for age, gender and race, the estimated odds ratio for hypertension in Ala92 allele carriers compared with Thr92 homozygotes was 2.11 (95% CI: 1.15 to 3.89). Among euthyroid adults, the common Ala92 allele of the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase increases risk for the development of hypertension. These data support an important role for genetic variation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid pathway in influencing susceptibility to hypertension.
