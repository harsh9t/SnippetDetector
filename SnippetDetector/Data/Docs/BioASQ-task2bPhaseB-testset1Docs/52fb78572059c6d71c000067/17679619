BACKGROUND: Short-QT syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by a short QT interval and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The clinical significance of a short QT interval observed in a randomly recorded ECG is not known. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence and prognostic significance of a short QT interval in a general population. METHODS AND RESULTS: QT intervals were measured from the 12-lead ECGs of 10 822 randomly selected middle-aged subjects (5658 males, mean age 44+/-8.4 years) enrolled in a population study and followed up for 29+/-10 years. The end points were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In addition to Bazett's method (corrected QT interval, or QTc), the Fridericia (QTfc) and nomogram (QTnc) methods were used to correct the QT interval for heart rate. The cutoff values for short QT intervals were defined as 320 ms (very short) and 340 ms (short). The prevalence of QT interval <320 ms based on QTc, QTfc, and QTnc was 0.10%, 0.08%, and 0.06%, and the prevalence of QT interval <340 ms was 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively. The majority of subjects with short QT intervals were males. All-cause or cardiovascular mortality did not differ between subjects with a very short or short QT interval and those with normal QT intervals (360 to 450 ms). There were no sudden cardiac deaths, aborted sudden cardiac deaths, or documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias among subjects with a QTfc <340 ms. CONCLUSIONS: A short QT interval does not appear to indicate an increased risk for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged nonreferral, community-based individuals.
