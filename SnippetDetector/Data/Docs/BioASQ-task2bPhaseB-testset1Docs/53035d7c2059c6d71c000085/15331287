Commotio cordis is ventricular fibrillation that results from blunt chest trauma and is a life threatening condition; early resuscitation and defibrillation are critical. This may occur during sporting events or from child abuse and most patients are boys who are younger than 16 years. Commotio cordis' prognosis depends on the availability of cardiac defibrillation. Automatic defibrillators at convenient locations near sporting events, combined with improved cardiopulmonary resuscitation education, may improve chances of survival after this rare phenomenon. Transient cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias have been observed in survivors; therefore, cardiac clearance before resumption of sports is indicated.
