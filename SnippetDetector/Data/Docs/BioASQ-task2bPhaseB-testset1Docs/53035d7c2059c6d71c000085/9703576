<abstract>
Cardiac concussion, previously known as commotio cordis, occurs in structurally normal hearts without gross or microscopic injury to the myocardium, cardiac valves, or coronary arteries, as opposed to other sports-related deaths known to occur more frequently in structural or congenital heart disease. We describe the sudden cardiac death of a 2-year-old child, who died as a result of a blunt force impact to the chest. A thorough medicolegal investigation was necessary to determine that the child died as a result of foul play.
