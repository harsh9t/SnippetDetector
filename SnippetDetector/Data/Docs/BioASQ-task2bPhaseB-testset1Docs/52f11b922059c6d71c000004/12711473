Mutations that inactivate either TSC1 or TSC2 cause tuberous sclerosis. We have used immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis to see whether there is phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, and the ribosomal S6 protein in angiomyolipomas occurring in tuberous scierosis. Hamartin (encoded by TSC1) and S6K was expressed in all samples. Tuberin (TSC2) was weak or absent in angiomyolipomas, but present in healthy kidney, whereas, phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase and p56 were present only in angiomyolipomas. Our results indicate activation of a mammalian target of rapamycin metabolic pathway in tuberous sclerosis lesions, which contributes to their growth. We suggest that treatment with rapamycin and its analogues could benefit such patients.
