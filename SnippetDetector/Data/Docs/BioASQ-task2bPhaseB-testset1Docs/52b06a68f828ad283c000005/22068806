Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance, associated with multiple hamartomas in several organs, such as the brain, skin, lung, kidney, heart and eyes. The authors of this study report a case of a 30 years old female patient with tuberous sclerosis, presenting multiple angiofibromas on face treated with high frequency equipment (radiofrequency), and discuss the therapeutic options for treatment of individuals with extensive cutaneous involvement in tuberous sclerosis.
