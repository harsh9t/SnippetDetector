Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance, associated with hamartomas in several organs and various skin findings. A case of a ten year old boy is presented here to highlight the multisystem involvement in tuberous sclerosis. The child had seizures, facial papular naevi and peri-ungual fibromas. MRI revealed cortical tubers, white matter lesions and subependymal nodules. Orbital ultrasound showed retinal hamartoma on the left side. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a soft tissue mass at the upper pole of left kidney with a small cyst in right kidney.
