Tuberous sclerosis is a dominant hereditary disease characterized by the appearance of angiofibromas on the face, epileptic attacks, and mental retardation. Attention has been paid to the atypical cells observed histologically in the stroma of the angiofibroma as they may play an important role in forming lesions. We have established a cell line from an angiofibroma to clarify the nature of these cells at the cellular and biochemical levels. The cultured cells have been stably maintained for four years and show an abnormal morphology resembling that of neuronal cells. In culture, these cells divide into daughter cells, which consist of both normal cells and abnormal ones whose nuclei disintegrate and cannot divide further. The cells resemble normal fibroblasts in their pattern of staining with antibodies against tubulin, actin, vimentin, and fibronectin. However, they also stain with an antibody against the glia-specific acidic protein, which is thought to be a specific marker protein for glial cells. The gel profile of cyclic-AMP binding proteins was not fibroblastic, but rather of the neuron cell type. These results indicate the gene expression of these cells is also abnormal. They are a useful tool for understanding this specific genetic disease.
