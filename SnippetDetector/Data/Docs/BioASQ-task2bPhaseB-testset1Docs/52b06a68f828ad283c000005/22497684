Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant genetic disease characterized by a spectrum of pathologic manifestations involving skin, brain, kidney, and heart. These manifestations include neuroectodermal, mesodermal, and skin lesions as well as a variety of associated tumors and hamartomas. We report an 11-year-old male with previously diagnosed TSC who presented with a laryngeal mass shown on histology to be fetal cellular rhabdomyoma. Cardiac rhabdomyomas are common in TSC patients, but to our knowledge, the association between TSC and extracardiac rhabdomyomas has not been previously reported.
