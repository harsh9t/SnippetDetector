Triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. However, the extent of its contribution to the regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release remains unclear, because overexpression of triadin in single-transgenic mice was associated with the downregulation of its homologous protein, junctin. In the present study, this problem was circumvented by cross-breeding of mice with heart-directed overexpression of triadin and junctin (JxT). This resulted in a stable approximately threefold expression of total triadin but unchanged junctin protein. Transgenic mice exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and structural abnormalities of myofibrils. Measurement of cardiac function by echocardiography and edge detection in myocytes revealed an impaired relaxation in JxT mice. The stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors resulted in a depressed contractility and an impaired relaxation in catheterized hearts and myocytes of JxT mice. The use of a maximum stimulation frequency (5 Hz) was associated with both a lower shortening and relengthening in isolated myocytes of JxT mice. The contractile effects in JxT myocytes were paralleled by similar changes of the intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca](i)) peak amplitude and Ca transient decay kinetics at basal conditions, under administration of isoproterenol, and with high-frequency stimulation. Finally, we found a higher caffeine-induced [Ca](i) peak amplitude in JxT myocytes. Our data show that the stable expression of triadin, independent of junctin expression, resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, prolonged basal relaxation, a depressed response to beta-adrenergic agonists, and altered Ca transients. Thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal SR Ca cycling and contractile function.
