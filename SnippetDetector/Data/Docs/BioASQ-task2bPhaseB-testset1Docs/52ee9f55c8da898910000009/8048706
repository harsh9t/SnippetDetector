Loss of consciousness in childhood may be due to cardiovascular causes, and the Long Q-T syndromes can present with seizures. The Romano-Ward syndrome is of autosomal dominant inheritance, and the Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, with associated deafness, of autosomal recessive inheritance. The diagnosis is often delayed, but a careful history can avoid this. The syndromes can appear to be due to an imbalance in the sympathetic nerve to the ventricular myocardium, and precipitating causes such as stress suggest a CNS influence on this. The electrocardiogram can confirm the prolonged Q-T interval, but this is not always present, at least without an exercise test. Treatment with beta-blockers is often successful. If a wrong diagnosis of epilepsy is made a chance may be missed of avoiding sudden death, quite apart from all the medical, and social consequences that can result from such a diagnosis.
