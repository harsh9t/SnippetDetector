We have investigated the possibility of mutations in the calcitonin/calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) gene in children with Williams syndrome. Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels. To test the hypothesis that mutations in the calcitonin/CGRP gene might be responsible for the reduced calcitonin levels, we examined the calcitonin/CGRP gene structure in Williams syndrome children. Analysis of white blood cell DNA by Southern blot hybridizations in 5 individuals did not show any detectable large deletions or rearrangements in the calcitonin/CGRP gene locus. The possibility of small deletions or point mutations within the exon encoding the mature calcitonin hormone is unlikely based on ribonuclease protection assays with patient DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. These findings suggest that the calcitonin deficiency might be due either to mutations elsewhere in the gene or to defects in the cellular machinery needed for calcitonin synthesis and/or secretion.
