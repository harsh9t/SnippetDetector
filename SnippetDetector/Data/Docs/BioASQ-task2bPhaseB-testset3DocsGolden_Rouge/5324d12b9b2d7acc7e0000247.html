We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet.
The aim was to investigate this association in a primary-care setting.
GERD symptoms were evaluated using a subdimension of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale for heartburn and regurgitation domains.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease patients often complain of symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ).
The aim of this study was to establish the recurrence of GERD-rs, in CD patients with nonerosive reflux disease.
Second, the prevalence of oesophagitis was estimated in 382 untreated and 232 treated coeliac patients; controls here comprised 5404 patients with dyspeptic symptoms and 2525 patients with reflux symptoms.
The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population.
METHODS: We evaluated 133 adult CD patients at diagnosis and 70 healthy controls.
Lactose intolerance is common in the general population and can mimic symptoms of FGID or coexist with FGID.
There is a great interest in the role of a major dietary protein, gluten, in the production of symptoms that are very similar to those of patients with celiac disease without the enteropathy that characterizes celiac disease.
