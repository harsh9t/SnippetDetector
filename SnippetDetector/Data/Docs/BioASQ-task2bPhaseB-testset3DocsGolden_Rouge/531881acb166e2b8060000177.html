Hsp90 inhibitors at low concentrations, which did not exert cytocidal effects but inactivated key anti-apoptotic proteins including erbB2, Akt, and NF-kB, efficiently sensitized bladder cancer cells (T24, 5637 and UM-UC-3 cells) to in vitro CRT by enhancing apoptosis.
In mice UM-UC-3 tumor xenografts model, Hsp90 inhibitors successfully potentiated anti-tumor activity of CRT.
(PMID: 22134243) The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), which simultaneously inactivated both Akt and ERK signaling at noncytocidal concentrations, synergistically potentiated the cytotoxicity of CDDP against BCICs by enhancing CDDP-induced apoptosis in vitro.
(PMID: 21964864) Geldanamycin (GA) can be considered a relatively new component with a promising mode of action against human malignancies.
It specifically targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone.
In toto, we have evinced the dose-dependent and cell line-specific actions of geldanamycin on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of critical Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling -oncogenic- integrity.
