Mutations in the genes of the mismatch DNA repair system and of the TGF-beta-II-receptor, the main defects of the HNPCC (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), are exclusively identified in sequences of microsatellites.
In HNPCC families, germline mutations in any of four genes encoding proteins of a specialized DNA repair system, the mismatch repair, predispose to cancer development.
