(PMID: 19284180)  Cranberry products affect the surface properties, such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharides, and adhesion of fimbriated and nonfimbriated E.
coli.
(PMID: 19257836)  Cranberry juice has been shown to be effective in preventing adhesion of bacteria such as Escherichia coli to the bladder epithelium.
(PMID: 22499815) Inhibition of adherence to an extent of about 70% with multi-drug resistant E.
coli strains was observed on uroepithelial cell.
The anti-adherence bioactivity of the proanthocyanidin was detected at concentrations of 10-50 ug/ml with significant bacteriuria.
(PMID: 21688109) In vitro studies have shown that binding of the P fimbriae of Escherichia coli to the uroepithelial tissue can be inhibited in the presence of proanthocyanidins, the active ingredient of cranberries.
(PMID: 19636526) These data suggest that daily consumption of concentrated cranberry juice can significantly prevent the recurrence of symptomatic UTIs in children.
