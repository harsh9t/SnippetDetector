The HNPCC syndrome (hereditary non polyposis colon cancer) or Lynch syndrome stands for an autosomic dominant condition leading to the most prevalent hereditary colo-rectal cancers (CCR).
MMR (mismatch repair) s genes are involved in carcinogenesis as they play a role in ADNA mismatch repair.
Mutations in the genes of the mismatch DNA repair system and of the TGF-beta-II-receptor, the main defects of the HNPCC (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), are exclusively identified in sequences of microsatellites.
