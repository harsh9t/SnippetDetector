LDH inhibition by oxamate induced G2/M cell cycle arrest via downregulation of the CDK1/cyclin B1 pathway and promoted apoptosis through enhancement of mitochondrial ROS generation.
N-acetylcysteine, a specific scavenger of ROS, significantly blocked the growth inhibition effect induced by oxamate.
IOA exhibited effective cell growth inhibition by inducing cancer cells to undergo G(2)-M phase arrest and apoptosis.
Further investigation revealed that IOA s inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude mice model.
Cell cycle blockade was associated with increased levels of p21 and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, cdc2, and cdc25C.
