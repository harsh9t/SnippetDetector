In Cox analyses, fT3 was a significant predictor of mortality independent of the main traditional as well as non-traditional risk factors.
These data lend support to the hypothesis that thyroid dysfunction is implicated in the high risk of the ESRD population.
However, serum fT3 level is a strong and inverse mortality predictor, in part explained by its underlying association with nutritional state and inflammation.
Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, showed that mortality was best predicted by total triiodothyronine (T3).
The Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed significantly worse cumulative survival rates in the 'lower' T3 group (P<0.
001).
All-cause and CV mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with 'lower' T3 levels than in the 'higher' T3 group (113.
4 vs 18.
2 events per 1000 patient-years, P<0.
001, and 49.
8 vs 9.
1 events per 1000 patient-years, P=0.
001, respectively).
Increased rT3 may be more common in ESRD patients than previously described, and together with decreased T3 it may serve as an indicator of poor prognosis in subsequent months.
