This situation was encountered in the development of LY2062430, a therapeutic mid-domain monoclonal anti-amyloid beta peptide (AΞ²) antibody undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease.
This communication reports the development and validation of a novel radioimmunoassay used to measure potential patient immune responses to AΞ² in the presence of LY2062430.
Solanezumab (LY2062430) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the central region of Ξ²-amyloid, a peptide believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease (AD).
LY2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody being studied as a putative disease-modifying treatment of AD.
