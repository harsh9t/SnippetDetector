We assessed, in a feasibility study, whether telematic transmission using the DreamΒ® and SleepboxΒ® technologies was associated with low HPSG failure rate.
The paper describes the development of biomedical clothing for ambulatory telemonitoring of human vital parameters.
In this study, we monitored remotely self-measured body weight and blood pressure, in parallel with the data automatically transmitted by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.
In patients with diabetes, mobile telemonitoring has potential for delivering intensified care to improve blood pressure control, and its use may be associated with reduced exposure to hyperglycemia.
Mobile telemonitoring for achieving tighter targets of blood pressure control in patients with complicated diabetes:.
Blood pressure appears to offer no additional value.
Home-polysomnography (HPSG) has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis.

Telemonitoring is currently being used in community-based healthcare, at the scene of medical emergencies, by ambulance services and in hospitals.
