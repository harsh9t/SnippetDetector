Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed anticonvulsant for the treatment of epilepsy.
Here we demonstrate that VPA is a novel activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular metabolism, using primary mouse and human hepatocytes.
These studies are the first to establish VPA and its metabolites as in vitro activators of AMPK.
