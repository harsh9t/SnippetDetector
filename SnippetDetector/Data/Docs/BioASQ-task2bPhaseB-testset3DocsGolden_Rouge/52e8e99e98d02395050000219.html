The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy.
At present use of biological agents throughout pregnancy cannot be recommended.
(PMID: 21346578) Drugs recommended to be stopped before pregnancy include methotrexate and leflunomide, plus the biologics: anti-TNF agents, rituximab and abatacept.
(PMID: 21120498) Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception.
(PMID: 19506586) Pregnancy experience with abatacept and rituximab is still too limited to prove their safety for the developing fetus.
They must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy.
(PMID: 18504282) Prophylactic withdrawal of drugs before pregnancy is mandatory for abatacept, rituximab, LEF and MMF.
(PMID: 18504282) As such, it is recommended that abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab be withheld prior to pregnancy; however, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and anakinra may be continued until conception.
