We report on two prenatal ultrasound diagnoses of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) associated with mutation of the cardiac Ξ²-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7)  A novel alpha-tropomyosin mutation associates with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy  Severe familial left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy due to a novel troponin T (TNNT2) mutation  This novel homozygous truncating mutation in the isoform-1 specific region of the DSP C-terminus caused Carvajal syndrome comprising severe early-onset heart failure with features of non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
