These results encourage clinical trials of Hsp90 inhibitors to overcome CRT resistance in patients with MIBC.
17 - demethoxygeldanamycin, which simultaneously inactivated both Akt and ERK signaling at noncytocidal concentrations, synergistically potentiated the cytotoxicity of CDDP against BCICs by enhancing CDDP-induced apoptosis in vitro.
In this study, we have investigated the effect of 17-AAG on the regulation of Hsp90-dependent signaling pathways directly implicated in cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human urinary bladder cancer cell lines.
Here, we systematically evaluated the inhibitory effects of the prototypical Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin on cellular processes involved in invasion and angiogenesis in T24 bladder cancer cells stimulated with HGF and chemical hypoxia.
RESULTS: We have herein demonstrated that, upon geldanamycin treatment, bladder cancer cells are prominently arrested in the G1 phase of cell cycle and eventually undergo programmed cell death via combined activation of apoptosis and autophagy.
It specifically targets heat shock protein 90 and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone.
CONCLUSIONS: In toto, we have evinced the dose-dependent and cell line-specific actions of geldanamycin on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of critical Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling - oncogenic - integrity.
