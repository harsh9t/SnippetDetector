The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer.
Merck's lambrolizumab (MK-3475) monoclonal antibody received "Breakthrough Therapy" designation from the U.
S.
Food and Drug Administration in April for treating patients with advanced melanoma.
We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.
In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.
