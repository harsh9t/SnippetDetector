Based on approximately 4,000 daily pairs of measurements pooled for all patients, weight inversely correlated with activity and with the difference between MHR and RHR.
In this study, we monitored remotely self-measured body weight and blood pressure, in parallel with the data automatically transmitted by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.
The first part involved selection of appropriate sensors.
The design of this system consisted of three parts: sensors, analog signal processing circuits, and a user-friendly graphical user interface.
The second part consisted of processing the analog signals obtained from these sensors.
The input element of the system was the home monitor with two sensors for recording the trans-abdominal fetal heart signal and the uterine contractions.
The purpose of this article is to describe a new, phonocardiography-based fetal telemonitoring system, which, due to its passive nature, allows long-term measurements even at the home of the pregnant woman.
A controller of the terminal is in charge of processing data collected from the wireless sensors and communicating with the monitoring platform.
Fall detection of the elderly is a major public health problem.
90 % of the recordings were of excellent quality.
The paper describes the development of biomedical clothing for ambulatory telemonitoring of human vital parameters.
