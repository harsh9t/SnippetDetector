HGF and chemical hypoxia with CoCl2 cooperatively promoted in vitro invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, while CoCl2 but not HGF activated urokinase-type plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase 2, both of which promote invasion and angiogenesis.
Notably, brief GA pretreatment inhibited in vitro invasion and VEGF secretion induced by HGF as effectively as did continuous treatment.
Low dose GA (100 nmol/L) inhibited these processes by suppressing both HGF and HIF-1 pathways.
Moreover, we found that GA inhibited activation of focal adhesion kinase, focal adhesion assembly, and actin reorganization induced by HGF and integrin engagement by extracellular matrix.
GA downregulated Met by inhibiting new protein maturation, thereby dampening HGF signaling.
Geldanamycin (GA) can be considered a relatively new component with a promising mode of action against human malignancies.
Furthermore, 17-AAG administration was shown to induce a pronounced downregulation of multiple Hsp90 protein clients and other downstream effectors, such as IGF-IR, Akt, IKK-Ξ±, IKK-Ξ², FOXO1, ERK1/2 and c-Met, resulting in sequestration-mediated inactivation of NF-ΞΊB, reduced cell proliferation and decline of cell motility.
