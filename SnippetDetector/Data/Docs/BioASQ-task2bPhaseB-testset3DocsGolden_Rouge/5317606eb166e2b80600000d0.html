Yes, induction of alpha-tubulin acetylation correlates with inhibition of cell motility, while it is involved in additional cellular processes, e.
g.
cell cycle progression, differentiation, intracellular trafficking, and signalling.
Dynamic microtubule (MT) acetylation/deacetylation mediating cell motility and adhesion is controlled by enzymes such as HDAC6, a major cytoplasmic Ξ±-tubulin deacetylase.
While its overexpression and activation is capable to enhance cell motility, HDAC6 activity can also be negatively regulated by a number of cellular inhibitors, thus decreasing the ability of cells for migration.
