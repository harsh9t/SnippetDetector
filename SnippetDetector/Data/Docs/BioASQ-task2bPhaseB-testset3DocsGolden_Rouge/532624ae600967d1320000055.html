Renal sympathetic denervation not only reduces blood pressure but also renal as well as systemic sympathetic nerve activity in such patients.
The reduction in blood pressure appears to be sustained over 3 years after the procedure, which suggests absence of re-innervation of renal sympathetic nerves.
Safety appears to be adequate.
(PMID: 23819768) Significant decreases and progressively higher reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed after RSD.
The complication rate was minimal.
In conclusion, the RSD presents itself as an effective and safe approach to resistant hypertension.
(PMID: 24029963) Clinical evaluation of selective renal sympathetic denervation demonstrated a decrease of renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, an increase of renal plasma flow, and has confirmed clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension.
