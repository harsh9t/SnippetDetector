LY2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody being studied as a putative disease-modifying treatment of AD.
Specimens from Phase 2 studies of the Ξ³-secretase inhibitor semagacestat and the therapeutic antibody solanezumab at baseline and following 12-14 weeks of treatment were also tested.
To assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 12 weekly infusions of solanezumab, an anti-Ξ²-amyloid (AΞ²) antibody, in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer s disease.
Solanezumab (LY2062430) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the central region of Ξ²-amyloid, a peptide believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease (AD).
