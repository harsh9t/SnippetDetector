Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations (PMID: 21761402) Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series.
(PMID: 22392042) Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %).
(PMID: 23580068) A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutations The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages.
Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%); These findings suggest that breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2.
