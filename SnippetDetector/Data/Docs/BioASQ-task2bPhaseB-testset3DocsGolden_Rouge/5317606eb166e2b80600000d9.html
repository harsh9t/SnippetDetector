HDAC6 is a major cytoplasmic a-tubulin deacetylase that is involved in cell motility and adhesion.
the enzymes responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known.
GRK2-HDAC6-mediated regulation of tubulin acetylation also modulates cellular spreading.
Microtubules are highly dynamic polymers of / tubulin heterodimers that play key roles in cell division and in organizing cell cytoplasm.
Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating microtubule stability and function.
TPPP/p25 is an unstructured protein that induces microtubule polymerization in vitro and is aligned along the microtubule network in transfected mammalian cells.
GRK2, which levels inversely correlate with the extent of - tubulin acetylation in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate - tubulin deacetylase activity.
Protein acetylation, especially histone acetylation, is the subject of both research and clinical investigation.
This review highlights the emerging roles of tubulin acetylation in multiple cellular functions, ranging from cell motility, cell cycle progression or cell differentiation to intracellular trafficking and signalling.
Our results show that HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provide evidence that reversible acetylation regulates important biological processes beyond histone metabolism and gene transcription.
These and other inhibitors also affect microtubule acetylation.
