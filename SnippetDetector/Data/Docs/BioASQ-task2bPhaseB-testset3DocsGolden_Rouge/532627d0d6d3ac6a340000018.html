Outcome of shunting in INPH is most often successful when patients are accurately diagnosed, suitably evaluated for surgical candidacy, and managed carefully throughout the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative periods.
The decision to perform the only efficient procedure, i.
e.
, a ventricular shunt operation, depends upon a number of established arguments in favor of that procedure.
Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can then confirm the diagnosis.
(PMID: 10586442)  After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.
95 +- 0.
44 vs 4.
38 +- 0.
68, p = 10(-7)) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of 48.
7%.
(PMID: 21993525) Shunt treatment showed an effect on cognitive functions of distractibility of attention and motor speed, but not on intelligence of memory.
Three patients deteriorated, eleven remained stable and sixteen showed significant improvement on psychological tests, mainly those for attention, motor speed and memory, but rarely did any improvement of intelligence occur.
