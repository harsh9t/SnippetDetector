Ponezumab is a humanized antiamyloid beta (AΞ²) monoclonal antibody designed to treat Alzheimer disease (AD).
LY2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody being studied as a putative disease-modifying treatment of AD.
Ponezumab (PF-04360365) is a humanized anti-amyloid beta (AΞ²) monoclonal antibody designed for treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD).
The most developmentally advanced monoclonal antibody directly targeting Abeta is bapineuzumab, now being studied in a large Phase III clinical trial.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that passive AΞ² immunotherapy with bapineuzumab results in decreases in CSF T-tau and P-tau, which may indicate downstream effects on the degenerative process.
The second set of baseline scans was from the EXPanding alzhEimer s Disease InvestigaTIONs (EXPEDITION) studies examining solanezumab, an anti-AΞ² monoclonal antibody (cohort 2, n = 2141).
