And N-, K-, and H-RAS (codons 12, 13, and 61).
Exons 1 and 2 of KRAS.
Analysis of KRAS (codon12/13).
KRAS (codon 12/13 hotspot).
Three hotspots in KRAS (codons 12/13, 61 and 146).
Mutations C742T, G746T, G747T in the TP53 gene and G35T in the KRAS gene have been repeatedly found in sectors of human tumors.
In this study we analyzed 15 sMTC for mutations in the hotspots codon 12, 13 and 61 of the H- and K-ras oncogene.
Mutation in the codon 12, 13 and 61 of the H-ras and K-ras oncogene.
The mutation hotspots of the K-ras proto-oncogene in human functional adrenocortical tumors are in codons 15, 16, 18, and 31.
Mutations occurring in mutational hotspots (codons 12 and 13) of the KRAS protein.
