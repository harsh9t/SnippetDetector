The gene responsible for AR-JP was recently identified and designated parkin.
We focus on PARK7, a gene relates to an autosomal recessive form of early-onset Parkinsonism and encodes a protein named DJ-1.
Oss-of-function mutations in Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism with early-onset.
We focus on PARK7, an autosomal recessive form of early-onset parkinsonism caused by mutations in the DJ-1 gene.
PINK-1 for an autosomal-recessive early-onset variant.
Mutations in the Parkin gene (PARK2) are the major cause of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism.
Mutations of the parkin gene on chromosome 6 cause autosomal recessive, early onset parkinsonism.
Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 all cause autosomal-recessive parkinsonism of early onset.
Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1 and PINK1 all cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.
Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.
Mutations in the DJ-1 gene associated with autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism.
