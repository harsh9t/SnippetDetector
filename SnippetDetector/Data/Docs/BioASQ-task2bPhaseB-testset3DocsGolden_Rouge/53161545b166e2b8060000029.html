This fact explains the relatively late clinical manifestation of the disease and offers the possibility to identify carriers with an increased risk of colorectal cancer development in order to integrate them into a program of control and preventive medicine.
Mutations in the genes of the mismatch DNA repair system and of the TGF-beta-II-receptor, the main defects of the HNPCC, are exclusively identified in sequences of microsatellites.
Because the binding site of beta-catenin is localized in the C-terminus of the Ape protein, disturbances result in the cellular signal transfer from its loss.
Mutations of tumor suppressor genes, of the mismatch DNA repair system, and of the TGF-beta-II-receptor are the main causes for a higher risk of colorectal cancer.
MMR 's genes are involved in carcinogenesis as they play a role in ADNA mismatch repair.
Microsatellite instability induced by germline mutations is characteristic of such tumors and is necessary to assert the diagnosis.
The HNPCC syndrome or Lynch syndrome stands for an autosomic dominant condition leading to the most prevalent hereditary colo-rectal cancers ( CCR ).
Due to the lack of pathognomonic morphological or biomolecular markers, HNPCC has traditionally posed unique problems to clinicians and geneticists alike, both in terms of diagnosis and clinical management.
