Cardiac function and mechanics are significantly affected by low thyroid function.
l-T4 therapy improves but does not completely recover cardiac function in patients with mild hypothyroidism.
Long-term T4 treatment after myocardial infarction has beneficial effects on myocyte, arteriolar, and collagen matrix remodeling in the non-infarcted area.
Most importantly, results suggest improved survival of myocytes in the peri-infarct area.
