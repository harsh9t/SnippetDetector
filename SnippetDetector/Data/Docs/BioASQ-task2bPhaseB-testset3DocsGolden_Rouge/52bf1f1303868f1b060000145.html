Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is an antioxidant enzyme that uses cysteine residues to decompose peroxides.
(PMID: 18479207) Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) has been known to act as an antioxidant enzyme whose main function is H(2)O(2) reduction in cells.
(PMID: 21248284) Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), a thiol-dependent peroxidase, is the third most abundant protein in the erythrocyte, and its absence in knock-out mice gives rise to hemolytic anemia.
(PMID: 17105810) Human erythrocyte peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a typical 2-cys cytosolic peroxiredoxin with thiol-dependent hydrogen peroxide scavenger activity.
(PMID: 19375361) Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prdx2), a potent peroxide reductant, is the third most abundant protein in the erythrocyte and might be expected to play a major role in the cell's oxidative defenses.
