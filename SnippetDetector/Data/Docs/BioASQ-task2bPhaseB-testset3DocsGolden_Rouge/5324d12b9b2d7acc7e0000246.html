Food intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Moderate to severe symptoms were significantly associated with the classical clinical presentation of CD (35.
0%).
Altogether, 0.
9% of patients with oesophagitis and 0.
6% of those with oesophageal reflux symptoms had coeliac disease.
The prevalence of oesophagitis was 5.
2% in untreated coeliac disease, 5.
6% in treated coeliac disease,.
The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population.
: At diagnosis, celiac patients had a significantly higher reflux symptom mean score than healthy controls (P <.
001).
Since the participation of gluten in the esophageal symptoms of CD seems clear, its intimate mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, and several hypothesis have been proposed, including the specific immune alterations characterizing CD, the reduction in nutrient absorption determining the arrival of intact gluten to distal gastrointestinal segments, and various dysregulations in the function of gastrointestinal hormones and peptides.
