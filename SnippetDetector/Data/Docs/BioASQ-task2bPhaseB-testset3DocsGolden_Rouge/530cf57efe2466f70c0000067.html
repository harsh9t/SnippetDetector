OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people living in the community.
Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment.
CONTEXT: Vitamin D affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly.
This review summarizes the benefits of vitamin D with the strongest evidence from randomized controlled trials for fall and fracture prevention.
Vitamin D use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls.
Moreover, vitamin D supplementation in combination with calcium can reduce fracture incidence by about 20 %.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the existing evidence on vitamin D use and the risk of falls.
Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance.
Studies investigating falls in the later phase after stroke report an incidence of up to 73 % in the first year post-stroke.
An anti-slip shoe device reduced rate of falls in icy conditions.
