Exogenous FGF-2 was shown to increase angiogenesis and myocardial perfusion, promote myocardial regeneration by activating the SDF-1Ξ±/CXCR4 axis, and thereby improve the cardiac function after myocardial infarction.
Furthermore, prevascularization with basic FGF-incorporated microspheres enhances the benefits of cardiomyocyte transplantation.
In another study, transmyocardial drilling revascularization combined with heparinized basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-incorporating degradable stent implantation (TMDRSI) was shown to promote Cardiac Progenitor Cells proliferation and differentiation into cardiomyocytes through activating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, while inhibiting myocardial apoptosis, thereby enhancing myocardial regeneration following myocardial infarction and improving cardiac function.
