Many organophosphorus compounds, including the organophosphate insecticides, may cause polyneuropathy of delayed onset.
(PMID: 7194975) Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy is a sensory-motor distal axonopathy which usually occurs after exposure of certain OP insecticides.
Neuropathies due to ingestion of OPs have rarely been reported in the literature.
(PMID: 18780003) Particular interactions are also addressed, such as those of pesticides acting as endocrine disruptors, the cumulative toxicity of organophosphates and organochlorines resulting in estrogenic effects and the promotion of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy.
(PMID: 22728724) Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a rare toxicity resulting from exposure to certain organophosphorus (OP) esters.
Therefore, OPIDP may develop only after very large exposures to insecticides, causing severe cholinergic toxicity.
