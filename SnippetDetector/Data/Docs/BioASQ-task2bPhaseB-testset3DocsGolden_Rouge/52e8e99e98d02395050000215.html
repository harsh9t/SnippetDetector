Prophylactic withdrawal of drugs before pregnancy is mandatory for abatacept, rituximab, LEF and MMF.
Pregnancy experience with abatacept and rituximab is still too limited to prove their safety for the developing fetus.
They must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy.
Drugs recommended to be stopped before pregnancy include methotrexate and leflunomide, plus the biologics: anti-TNF agents, rituximab and abatacept.
As such, it is recommended that abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab be withheld prior to pregnancy; however, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and anakinra may be continued until conception.
