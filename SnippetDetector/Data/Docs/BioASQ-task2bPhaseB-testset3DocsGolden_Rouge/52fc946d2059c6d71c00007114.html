The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer.
Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/its ligand (PD-L1) antibodies have changed the landscape in oncology in 2013.
Because of all these reasons PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are considered 'drug of the year'.
Merck's lambrolizumab (MK-3475) monoclonal antibody received "Breakthrough Therapy" designation from the U.
S.
Food and Drug Administration in April for treating patients with advanced melanoma.
The most mature results have been obtained in advanced melanoma patients.
However, through parallel efforts that have showcased the efficacy of small-molecule BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, as well as the immune checkpoint inhibitors, namely ipilimumab and the anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies (lambrolizumab, nivolumab, MPDL3280), an opportunity exists to transform the treatment of melanoma specifically and cancer generally by exploring rational combinations of molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and molecular targeted therapies with immunotherapies.
We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.
