Mutations in the Parkin gene (PARK2) are the major cause of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism.
(PMID: 24244333) Early onset PD (EOPD) is particularly associated with autosomal recessive (AR) mutations, and three genes, PARK2, PARK7 and PINK1, have been found to carry mutations leading to AR disease.
(PMID: 22427796) oss-of-function mutations in Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism with early-onset.
(PMID: 19297401)  we focus on PARK7, a gene relates to an autosomal recessive form of early-onset Parkinsonism and encodes a protein named DJ-1.
