Clinical trials have demonstrated that bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of amyloid plaques, is not effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
The burden of beta amyloid plaques was reduced in response to bapineuzumab therapy.
However, bapineuzumab therapy did not improve cognitive functioning and was associated with significant adverse effects in Alzheimer's disease patients.
