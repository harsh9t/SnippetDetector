Biologics should be avoided unless there is a treatment need in cases of uncontrolled disease activity.
They must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy.
Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception.
As such, it is recommended that abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab be withheld prior to pregnancy; however, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and anakinra may be continued until conception.
Drugs recommended to be stopped before pregnancy include methotrexate and leflunomide, plus the biologics: anti-TNF agents, rituximab and abatacept.
Pregnancy experience with abatacept and rituximab is still too limited to prove their safety for the developing fetus.
Prophylactic withdrawal of drugs before pregnancy is mandatory for abatacept, rituximab, LEF and MMF.
The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy.
Case reports on abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy are not conclusive.
No significant adverse effects or complications were observed during the pregnancies, and all three patients delivered healthy newborns.
