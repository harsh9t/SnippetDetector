We show that a mutation in TPM1 is associated with DCM and a lethal, early onset form of NCCM.
Mutation in MYH7B causes a classical LVNC phenotype.
The molecular classification of cardiomyopathies includes an MYH7-associated spectrum of NCCM.
This novel homozygous truncating mutation in the isoform-1 specific region of the DSP C-terminus caused Carvajal syndrome comprising severe early-onset heart failure with features of non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
We describe a family with LVNC due to a novel missense mutation, pE96K, in the cardiac troponin T gene.
Severe familial left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy due to a novel troponin T (TNNT2) mutation.
A novel alpha-tropomyosin mutation associates with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
We report on two prenatal ultrasound diagnoses of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) associated with mutation of the cardiac Ξ²-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7).
We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM families, the identification of mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7).
