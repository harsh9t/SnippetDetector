analysis of KRAS (codon12/13)  exons 1 and 2 of KRAS  KRAS (codon 12/13 hotspot)  three hotspots in KRAS (codons 12/13, 61 and 146)  and N-, K-, and H-RAS (codons 12, 13, and 61)  mutations occurring in mutational hotspots (codons 12 and 13) of the KRAS protein  mutation in the codon 12, 13 and 61 of the H-ras and K-ras oncogene  In this study we analyzed 15 sMTC for mutations in the hotspots codon 12, 13 and 61 of the H- and K-ras oncogene.
mutations C742T, G746T, G747T in the TP53 gene and G35T in the KRAS gene have been repeatedly found in sectors of human tumors  the mutation hotspots of the K-ras proto-oncogene in human functional adrenocortical tumors are in codons 15, 16, 18, and 31.
