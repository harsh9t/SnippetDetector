Celiac disease (CD) patients often complain of symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD).
The association between these two conditions is, at most, weak, but a gluten-free diet may still bring symptomatic relief for reflux symptoms in coeliac disease  Effect of gluten-free diet on preventing recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease-related symptoms in adult celiac patients with nonerosive reflux disease.
In coeliac patients, the reflux symptoms were mild but nevertheless were alleviated on a gluten-free diet.
GERD symptoms are common in classically symptomatic untreated CD patients.
The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population.
