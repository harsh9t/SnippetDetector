RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK were more abundant in tumors and metastatic lymph nodes than in nontumor bladder and uninvolved lymph nodes (P < 0.
0001).
By univariate analysis, high RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK protein expression predicted shortened disease-free and overall survival (P < 0.
0001).
Alterations in RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42 expression play a significant role in the genesis and progression of UCC of the urinary bladder.
