Thus, an increasingly complex network of genes contributing in different ways to disease risk and progression is emerging.
Linkage studies and positional cloning strategies have identified mutations in a number of genes that cause several monogenic autosomal-dominant or autosomal-recessive forms of the disorder.
Here, we focus on PARK7, an autosomal recessive form of early-onset parkinsonism caused by mutations in the DJ-1 gene.
The identification of rare monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease has provided tremendous insight into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder.
Point mutations, duplications and triplications in the alpha-synuclein gene cause a rare dominant form of PS in families.
Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1 and PINK1 all cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.
PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 is a causative gene for autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism.
Over the last few years, genetic findings have changed our views on Parkinson's disease, as mutations in a growing number of genes are found to cause monogenic forms of the disorder.
Evidence is emerging that at least some of these genes may play a direct role in the etiology of the common sporadic form of PD.
Several genes have been identified for monogenic disorders that variably resemble Parkinson's disease.
