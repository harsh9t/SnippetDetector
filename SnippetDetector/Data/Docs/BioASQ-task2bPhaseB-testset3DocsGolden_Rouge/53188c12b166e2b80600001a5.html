AIM: The aim of this study is to review the literature pertaining to the role of the RhoA/ROCK system in male urogenital function.
CONCLUSION: Rho/ROCK pathway apparently involved in occurrence and progression of bladder cancer may be valuable prognostic markers.
We investigated the roles of Rho and ROCK in bladder cancer.
By univariate analysis, high RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK protein expression predicted shortened disease-free and overall survival.
By multivariate analysis, only RhoC was independently influenced in disease-free survival, and RhoA and RhoC in overall survival ( P ( 0.
001 ).
There were no other correlations among the 15 factors studied and pathologic stage, lymph node status, or tumor grade.
The Ras-transfected cells were then treated with either a PI-3K inhibitor or Rho kinase inhibitor ( Y-27632 ) and the expressions of Ras, PI-3K, Akt, NF-kappaB, and RhoA were analyzed.
PURPOSE: To investigate the expression of RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42 kinases in urothelial cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and determine the expression profile of 107 Rho-associated genes, including GTPases, GDIs, GAPs and GEFs.
On the contrary, mRNA of RhoC and protein levels of RhoA, RhoC and Cdc42, respectively, were significantly higher in UCC vs.
normal tissue.
