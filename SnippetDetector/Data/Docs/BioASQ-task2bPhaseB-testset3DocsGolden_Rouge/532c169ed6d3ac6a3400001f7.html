Ntegrins are heterodimeric structural components of the plasma membrane whose ligands include a large number of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.
The integrin receptor activation by T4 may take a role in plasma membrane processes involved in the male reproductive system.
Recently, integrin Ξ±vΞ²3 has been shown to have a panel of previously unappreciated small molecule receptor sites for thyroid hormone and hormone analogues, for dihydrotestosterone, and for resveratrol, a polyphenol that has certain estrogen-like features.
Rapid signaling via this plasma membrane binding site appears to be responsible for many nongenomic effects of thyroid hormones, independent of the classic nuclear receptors.
