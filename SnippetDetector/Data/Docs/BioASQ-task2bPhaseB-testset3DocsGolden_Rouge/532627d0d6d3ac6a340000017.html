Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can then confirm the diagnosis.
The remarkable and prompt improvement in the global CMRglu and in symptoms may also have important implications for the current concept of "neuronal plasticity" and for the cells' reactivity in order to recover their metabolic function.
Our preliminary data show that changes in the CMRglu are promptly reversible after surgery and that there is a relationship between the early metabolic changes and clinical symptoms, independently from the simultaneous changes in the ventricular size.
Clinical improvement depends not only on the capability to restore the cerebrospinal fluid dynamic, but also on the ability of cerebral parenchyma to recover the metabolic function.
Outcome of shunting in INPH is most often successful when patients are accurately diagnosed, suitably evaluated for surgical candidacy, and managed carefully throughout the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative periods.
After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.
