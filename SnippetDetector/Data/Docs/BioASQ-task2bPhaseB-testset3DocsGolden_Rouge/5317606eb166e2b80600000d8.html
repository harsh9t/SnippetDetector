GRK2 and HDAC6 colocalize in the lamellipodia of migrating cells, leading to local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility.
GRK2, which levels inversely correlate with the extent of - tubulin acetylation in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate - tubulin deacetylase activity.
We identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 as a key novel stimulator of HDAC6.
The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin is tightly controlled and stereotypic.
Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating microtubule stability and function.
TPPP/p25 is an unstructured protein that induces microtubule polymerization in vitro and is aligned along the microtubule network in transfected mammalian cells.
Our results highlight the role of alpha-tubulin acetylation in mediating the localization of microtubule-associated proteins.
GRK2-HDAC6-mediated regulation of tubulin acetylation also modulates cellular spreading.
This GRK2-HDAC6 functional interaction may have important implications in pathological contexts related to epithelial cell migration.
HDAC6 is a major cytoplasmic a-tubulin deacetylase that is involved in cell motility and adhesion.
Consistent with the hypothesis that tubulin deacetylase activity might affect cell response to the anti-motility activity of taxanes, we found that overexpression of the tubulin deacetylase SIRT2 increased cell motility and reduced cell response to the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel.
