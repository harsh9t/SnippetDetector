Low fT3 is an independent predictor of death in hemodialysis patients.
These data lend support to the hypothesis that thyroid dysfunction is implicated in the high risk of the ESRD population.
(PMID: 16775599) Low T3 was particularly common (44.
3 %), and clearly associated with increased 6- and 12-month mortality and decreased overall survival (log rank test, P=0.
007).
(PMID: 22881233) Increased rT3 may be more common in ESRD patients than previously described, and together with decreased T3 it may serve as an indicator of poor prognosis in subsequent months.
