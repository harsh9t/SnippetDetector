Molecular pathogenesis of gastrointestinal polyposis in Peutz-Jegher's syndrome (PJS) has been linked to the loss-of-function mutation of LKB1.
Recent functional genetic studies have pointed out that LKB1 plays a physiological role in controlling the Wnt-signaling pathway and activation of the pathway as a consequence of LKB1 haploinsufficiency might be responsible for the development of harmatomatous polyps.
