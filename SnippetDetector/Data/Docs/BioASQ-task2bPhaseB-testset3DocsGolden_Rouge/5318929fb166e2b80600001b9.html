Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is one of the most penetrant forms of familial cancer susceptibility syndromes, characterized by early age at tumor onset and a wide spectrum of malignant tumors.
Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited.
Their lifetime breast cancer risk is 49 % by age 60.
Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2 +.
Unstained slides and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from breast cancers from 39 germline TP53 mutation carriers were assembled from investigators in the LFS consortium.
We seek to complement the existing small literature with this report of a histopathologic analysis of breast cancers from women with documented LFS.
Basal breast cancers are now well recognized to be a typical sub-type of breast cancer developing in a large proportion of BRCA1 gene carriers.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011.
The median age at diagnosis was 32 years.
