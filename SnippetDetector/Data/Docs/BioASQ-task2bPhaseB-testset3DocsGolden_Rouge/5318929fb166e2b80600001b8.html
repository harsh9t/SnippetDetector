As seen in this case, most breast cancers in patients with LFS exhibit a triple-positive phenotype.
Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, an inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.
Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive.
We considered whether a similar narrow sub-type of breast cancer was found in TP53 gene mutation carriers.
The DCIS were positive for ER and HER2 in 27 % of the cases.
RESULTS: Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor amplification ( 83 % ) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases ( 16 % ); ER and PR status were equivalent between groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2.
The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation were compared with those testing negative ( controls ).
We assessed the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in a cohort of women with HER2 + breast cancer diagnosed age 50 years.
