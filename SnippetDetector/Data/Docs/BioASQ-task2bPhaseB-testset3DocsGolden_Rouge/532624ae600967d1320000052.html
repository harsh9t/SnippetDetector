In conclusion, the RSD presents itself as an effective and safe approach to resistant hypertension.
Novel procedure- and device-based strategies to control hypertension include renal sympathetic denervation and baroreflex sensitization.
In addition to drug treatment, baroreceptor stimulation therapy and renal sympathetic denervation are promising new approaches in this group of patients.
Significant decreases and progressively higher reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed after RSD.
The complication rate was minimal.
Clinical trials of renal sympathetic denervation have shown significant reductions in blood pressure in these patients.
Renal sympathetic denervation also reduces heart rate, which is a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk.
