Currently there are two U.
S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents that promote hair regrowth: over-the-counter topical minoxidil solution for men and women and prescription oral finasteride tablets for men.
In addition, low-level light therapy (LLLT) has recently been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hair loss.
Recently, in addition to the two currently approved U.
S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medications (minoxidil and finasteride), a novel device was FDA-approved for the treatment of hair loss, the laser hair comb.
Topical monoxidil and oral finasteride are commonly in use and have FDA approval for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia; dutasteride, a type I and II 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, is on hold in Phase III trials.
Finasteride (Propecia) was approved by the FDA in 1998 for treating men with androgenetic alopecia.
The only FDA-approved dermatological indication of finasteride is androgenetic alopecia.
