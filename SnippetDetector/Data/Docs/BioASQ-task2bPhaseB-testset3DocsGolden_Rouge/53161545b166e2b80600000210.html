Mutations of tumor suppressor genes, of the mismatch DNA repair system, and of the TGF-beta-II-receptor are the main causes for a higher risk of colorectal cancer.
MMR 's genes are involved in carcinogenesis as they play a role in ADNA mismatch repair.
Generally, complexly connected reactions are involved in this cascade of colorectal cancer genesis.
Lynch syndrome, or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, is an autosomal-dominant disease accounting for approximately 1-5 % of all colorectal cancer cases.
The HNPCC syndrome or Lynch syndrome stands for an autosomic dominant condition leading to the most prevalent hereditary colo-rectal cancers ( CCR ).
Microsatellite instability induced by germline mutations is characteristic of such tumors and is necessary to assert the diagnosis.
Among mutations of the Ape gene, which characterize the clinical manifestation of the familial polyposis, point mutations are dominating which create new stop codons or arise from deletions or insertions of nucleotides causing frame shifts.
Because the majority of Apc gene mutations is also localized in repetitive motifs even in CpG islands primary disturbances are to postulate in the methylation pattern of the genes producing germline and somatic mutations.
The present report summarizes the clinicopathological aspects of HNPCC and reviews the most recent molecular and biochemical findings.
