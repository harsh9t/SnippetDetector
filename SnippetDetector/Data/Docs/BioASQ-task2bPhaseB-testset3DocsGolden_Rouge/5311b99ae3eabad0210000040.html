Most common tests used in diagnosing normal kidney function include blood tests such as serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, also medical imaging tests like ultrasound and CT Scan.
Additionally kidney biopsy is used in more direct but invasive approach.
Lastly, and probably the most relevant tests to kidney function are urine tests along the lines of urinalysis, urine protein levels and microalbuminuria creatinine clearance.
