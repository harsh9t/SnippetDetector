Several forms of autosomal recessive parkinsonism are known.
Several genes have been identified for monogenic disorders that variably resemble Parkinson's disease.
Mutations in several genes are found to cause monogenic forms of the disorder.
Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 gene are causative of autosomal recessive, early onset Parkinson's disease.
The identification of rare monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease has provided tremendous insight into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder.
Single heterozygous mutations of PINK1 have been also identified sporadic Parkinson's disease patients.
Over the last years, a plethora of genetic findings have completely changed our views on the aetiology of Parkinson's disease.
This is the most frequent form of monogenic parkinsonism so far identified.
Early onset PD is particularly associated with autosomal recessive ( AR ) mutations, and three genes, PARK2, PARK7 and PINK1, have been found to carry mutations leading to AR disease.
Although the majority of PD cases are sporadic, 5-10 % of PD is monogenic form of PD as familial PD.
the study of rare monogenic forms of these disorders has proven to be fruitful.
PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease.
