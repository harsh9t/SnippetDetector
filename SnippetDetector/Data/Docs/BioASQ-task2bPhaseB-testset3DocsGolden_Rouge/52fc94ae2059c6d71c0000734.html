Solanezumab (LY2062430) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the central region of b-amyloid, a peptide believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
(PMID: 22288451)  LY2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody being studied as a putative disease-modifying treatment of AD.
(PMID: 20375655) A single dose of solanezumab was generally well tolerated, although infusion reactions similar to those seen with administration of other proteins may occur with higher doses.
A dose-dependent change in plasma and CSF Abeta was observed, although changes in cognitive scores were not noted.
