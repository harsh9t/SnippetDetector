Llow percentages of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in liquid chromatography solvents lead to a strong enhancement of electrospray ionization of peptides, improving the sensitivity of protein identification in bottom-up proteomics by up to tenfold.
Additionally, the presence of DMSO in the sample allow the retention time selectivity of the peptides.
