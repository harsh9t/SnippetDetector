PINK-1 for an autosomal-recessive early-onset variant  The gene responsible for AR-JP was recently identified and designated parkin.
Mutations in the DJ-1 gene associated with autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism.
Mutations of the parkin gene on chromosome 6 cause autosomal recessive, early onset parkinsonism.
Mutations in the Parkin gene (PARK2) are the major cause of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism.
In three forms, caused by mutations in parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), or DJ-1 (PARK7),  Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1 and PINK1 all cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.
Autosomal recessive parkinsonism associated with mutations in the parkin gene represents a monogenic form of hereditary parkinsonism.
Heritable mutations in alpha-synuclein, parkin, DJ-1 and PINK1 cause familial forms of PD.
mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 all cause autosomal-recessive parkinsonism of early onset.
