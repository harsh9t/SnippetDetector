RESULTS: After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased ) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of 48.
7 %.
METHODS: Eleven selected INPH patients underwent clinical assessment, cognitive evaluation ( Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE ) and dynamic (18) F-FDG PET/CT scan 3 days before and 1 week after ventricular shunt placement.
Cognitive functions such as fluency, selective attention and motor speed were re-examined within 24 hours after spinal tap of 40-50 cc.
Prospective clinical and computed tomographic monitoring was continued for at least 5 years.
INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is a disease that most frequently concerns subjects of an advanced age.
Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can then confirm the diagnosis.
After shunting, 17 of 20 iNPH patients were clinically improved; all scale scores decreased, and CMRglu significantly increased in all regions.
PURPOSE: We prospectively evaluated the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose before and after ventricular shunt placement in idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus ( iNPH ) patients, to investigate whether some brain regions are more involved than others; we also correlated the individual variations of CMRglu with the clinical scale score assessment after shunting.
After shunting, a significant correlation between individual variations of CMRglu and clinical assessment was found.
