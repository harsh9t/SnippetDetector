We investigated a strategy to potentiate CRT response of bladder cancer cells by using Hsp90 inhibitors in preclinical models.
Here, we systematically evaluated the inhibitory effects of the prototypical Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin on cellular processes involved in invasion and angiogenesis in T24 bladder cancer cells stimulated with HGF and chemical hypoxia.
In this study, we have investigated the effect of 17-AAG on the regulation of Hsp90-dependent signaling pathways directly implicated in cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human urinary bladder cancer cell lines.
These results encourage clinical trials of Hsp90 inhibitors to overcome CRT resistance in patients with MIBC.
Although radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, loss of native bladder frequently impairs patient's quality of life ( QOL ).
According to the cancer stem cell theory, this phenomenon is attributable to the re-growth of bladder cancer-initiating cells that have survived chemotherapy.
These data encourage clinical trials of Hsp90 inhibitors as they may improve therapeutic outcomes of CDDP-based combination chemotherapy against advanced bladder cancer.
Since both Met and HIF-1alpha proteins are heat shock protein 90 clients, Hsp90 inhibitors might be expected to positively impact tumor progression.
based combination chemotherapy is the first-line choice of treatment.
