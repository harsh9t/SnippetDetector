biased amplification of DNA templates might occur in the process of emulsion PCR, which results in production of artificial duplicate reads.
Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX.
Prior to SOLiD sequencing reaction, the libraries were amplified with emulsion PCR and enriched with the P2 enrichment beads.
We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing.
Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR.
The motivation of this research is to establish a system of target genomic DNA capture and enrichment, which could be used in deep sequencing of target regions with next-generation sequencing.
In our NGS approach, the 16,569-bp mtDNA is enriched by long-range PCR and the 108 nuclear genes are enriched by RainDance emulsion PCR.
Due to the difficulties in deep sequencing, high-throughput sequencing of ancient DNA has been limited to exceptionally well-preserved ancient materials.
The 454 Genome Sequencer FLX System is one of the next-generation sequencing systems featured by long reads, high accuracy, and ultra-high throughput.
