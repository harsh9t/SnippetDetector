TGF-beta) inducible early gene 1 (TIEG1) is known to induce apoptosis in TGF-beta sensitive pancreatic cancer cells, yet its effect on TGF-beta resistant cancer cells remains unclear (PMID: 18930345) overexpression of TIEG1, protected ALL cells against chemotherapy-induced cell death.
TIEG1 might be involved in mediating this effect from the microenvironment onto the leukemia cells (PMID: 18798273) TIEG1 acts as an inducer or repressor of gene transcription to enhance the TGFbeta/Smad pathway, as well at other signaling pathways, to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
(PMID: 17729309) In human and murine tissues it has been shown that TIEG1 and TIEG2 induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth (PMID: 17308981).
