One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB)  macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.
This repressor activity is further supported by the substantial and relatively uniform macroH2A1 enrichment along the inactive X chromosome, which averages 4-fold  Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A  In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies.
Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes.
Although macroH2A1 nucleosomes are widely distributed across the genome, their local concentration varies over a range of 100-fold or more.
