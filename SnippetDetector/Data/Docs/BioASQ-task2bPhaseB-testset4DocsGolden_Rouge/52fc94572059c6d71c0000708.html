In a recently completed phase III trial, apixaban also demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in that indication.
These results suggest a lack of clear superiority of apixaban relative to enoxaparin.
Nowadays, the new anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, show potential advantages over classical treatments.
Apixaban is an oral alternative with similar efficacy and safety to existing anticoagulant therapies.
Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.

For all cause mortality there were no significant differences between the novel oral anticoagulants and conventional treatment (0.
