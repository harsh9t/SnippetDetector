Aptamers are a special class of nucleic acid molecules that are beginning to be investigated for clinical use.
These small RNA/DNA molecules can form secondary and tertiary structures capable of specifically binding proteins or other cellular targets; they are essentially a chemical equivalent of antibodies.
Aptamers have the advantage of being highly specific, relatively small in size, and non-immunogenic.
In the last two decades, many aptamers have been clinically developed as inhibitors for targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombin.
The first aptamer based therapeutic was FDA approved in 2004 for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and several other aptamers are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
Preclinical studies using aptamer-siRNA chimeras and aptamer targeted nanoparticle therapeutics have been very successful in mouse models of cancer and HIV.
In summary aptamers are in several stages of development, from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials and even as FDA approved therapeutics.
(PMID: 21838685) Aptamers specific for a number of cellular and viral proteins have been documented previously; one aptamer (Macugen) is approved for clinical use and several others are in clinical trials.
