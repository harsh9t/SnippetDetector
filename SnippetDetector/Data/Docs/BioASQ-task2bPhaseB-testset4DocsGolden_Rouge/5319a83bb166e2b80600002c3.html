Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR.
Emulsion PCR-coupled target enrichment: an effective fishing method for high-throughput sequencing of poorly preserved ancient DNA  Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX.
We show the efficacy by comparing the method to a commercial kit and further demonstrate that emulsion PCR can be used for bias free amplification and virtual immortalization of DNA template libraries.
However, pyrosequencing of emulsion PCR reactions, amplifying from only one molecule at a time, can generate megabases of clonally amplified loci at high coverage, thereby greatly simplifying allelic sequence determination.
Briefly, amplified libraries carrying unique barcodes are prepared by fluorescent tagging of complementary sequences and then resolved by high-speed flow cytometric sorting of labeled emulsion PCR beads.
