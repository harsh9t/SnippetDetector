Geldanamycin is an ansamycin antibiotic which holds the ability to bind heat-shock protein 90.
This interaction can lead to the disruption of heat-shock protein 90-containing multimolecular complexes.
Additionally, it can induce inhibition or even degradation of partner proteins dissociated from the 90 kDa chaperone and, eventually, cause apoptosis in a variety of cell types.
