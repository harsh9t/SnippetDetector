The size distribution of chromosome 9 linked families was similar to that of non-linked families.
On average TSC families are very small; in most cases there are fewer than two informative meioses.
One option is to perform functional tests to assess whether the variants affect protein function.
Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a frequent autosomal-dominant condition (affecting 1 in 6000 individuals) caused by various mutations in either the hamartin (TSC1) or the tuberin gene (TSC2).
We have used this strategy to characterize variants identified in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes in individuals with, or suspected of having, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).
The tuberous sclerosis gene 2 product tuberin is an important regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant disorder.
The effects of missense changes and small in-frame deletions and insertions on protein function are not easy to predict, and the identification of such variants in individuals at risk of a genetic disease can complicate genetic counselling.
