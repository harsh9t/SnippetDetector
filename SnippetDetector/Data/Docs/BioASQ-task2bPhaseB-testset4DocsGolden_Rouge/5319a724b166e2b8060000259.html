Expansion of trinucleotide repeats is now recognized as a major cause of neurological disease.
The discovery that expansion of unstable repeats can cause a variety of neurological disorders has changed the landscape of disease-oriented research for several forms of mental retardation, Huntington disease, inherited ataxias, and muscular dystrophy.
Although polyglutamine tract lengthening presumably has a toxic gain of function effect in the CAG trinucleotide repeat disorders, the basis of this neuronal toxicity remains unknown.
The expanded trinucleotide repeats are unstable, and the phenomenon of anticipation, i.
e.
, worsening of disease phenotype over successive generations, correlates with increasing expansion size.
At least seven disorders result from trinucleotide repeat expansion: X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, two fragile X syndromes of mental retardation ( FRAXA and FRAXE ), myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 ( SCA1 ), and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ).
In this review, we compare the clinical and molecular features of the trinucleotide repeat diseases, which may be classified into two types.
The dynamic nature of these mutations provided an explanation for the variable phenotype expressivity within a family.
Beyond diagnosis and genetic counseling, the benefits from studying these disorders have been noted in both neurobiology and cell biology.
