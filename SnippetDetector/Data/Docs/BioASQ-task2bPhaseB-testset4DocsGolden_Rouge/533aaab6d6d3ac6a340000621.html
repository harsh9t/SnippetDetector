Yellow Fever (YF) is an acute viral communicable disease transmitted by an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus.
It is primarily a zoonotic disease, especially the monkeys.
Worldwide, an estimated 200β€‰000 cases of yellow fever occurred each year, and the case-fatality rate is ~15%.
Forty-five endemic countries in Africa and Latin America, with a population of close to 1 billion, are at risk.
Up to 50% of severely affected persons from YF die without treatment.
