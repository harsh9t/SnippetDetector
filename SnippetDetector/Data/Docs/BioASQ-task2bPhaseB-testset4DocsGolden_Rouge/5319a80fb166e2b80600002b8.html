whether MTOR exerts a positive or a negative effect on myocardial function remains to be fully elucidated.
Here, we show that ablation of Mtor in the adult mouse myocardium results in a fatal, dilated cardiomyopathy that is characterized by apoptosis, autophagy, altered mitochondrial structure, and accumulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1.
Drugs inhibiting MTOR are increasingly used in antineoplastic therapies.
Myocardial MTOR activity changes during hypertrophy and heart failure.
Mechanistic target of rapamycin plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and in the response to energy state changes.
In particular, they highlight the role of 4E-BP1 in regulating cardiomyocyte viability and in HF.
When the gene encoding 4E-BP1 was ablated together with Mtor, marked improvements were observed in apoptosis, heart function, and survival.
Our results demonstrate a role for the MTORC1 signaling network in the myocardial response to stress.
4E-BP1 is an MTOR-containing multiprotein complex-1 substrate that inhibits translation initiation.
When subjected to pressure overload, Mtor-ablated mice demonstrated an impaired hypertrophic response and accelerated HF progression.
