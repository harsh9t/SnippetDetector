None of the known progerias represents true precocious ageing.
Some of them, including Werner (WS), Bloom (BS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes (RTS) as well as combined xeroderma pigmentosa-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS) are characterised by features resembling precocious ageing and the increased risk of malignant disease.
Such phenotypes result from the mutations of the genes encoding proteins involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity, in most cases DNA helicases.
