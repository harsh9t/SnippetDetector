Geldanamycin is an antibiotic originally discovered based on its ability to bind heat-shock protein 90.
This interaction can lead to the disruption of heat-shock protein 90-containing multimolecular complexes.
It can also induce the inhibition or even degradation of partner proteins dissociated from the 90 kDa chaperone and, eventually, can cause apoptosis, for instance, in PC12 cells.

coli Hsp90 during client protein remodeling.
(PMID: 21525416) The molecular chaperone heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90 is an important anticancer drug target because it maintains the conformation, stability, and function of many important oncogenic client proteins, including those involved with signal transduction, cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, motility angiogenesis, and metastasis.
Using the standard inhibitors of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of Hsp90, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17- demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), novel solid-phase immunoassays have been validated using a time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) end point.
Their utility for confirming the mechanism of action of Hsp90 inhibition in secondary cell-based assays has been shown and applied to the novel Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159.
