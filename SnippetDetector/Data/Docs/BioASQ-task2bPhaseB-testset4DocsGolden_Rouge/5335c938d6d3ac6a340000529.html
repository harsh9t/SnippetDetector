OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic cost of urinary incontinence in community-dwelling Australian women aged 18 years and over for the year 1998.
PURPOSE: We quantified and described the economic burden of overactive bladder and stress urinary incontinence in Korea.
Overactive bladder is a highly prevalent condition among older patients, and its presence is associated with the use of substantial healthcare resources and economic costs.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the economic costs of overactive bladder, including community and nursing home residents, and to compare the costs in male versus female and older versus younger populations.
OAB may severely impair quality of life, and its overall economic costs to society are substantial.
Institutional costs were estimated from the costs of urinary incontinence in nursing homes, limited to only those with urge incontinence or mixed incontinence.
There is a need for urgency UI treatments that improve HRQoL of these patients and alleviate the economic burden of this condition.
Survey data estimates were combined with year 2000 average cost data to calculate the cost of OAB in the community.
UNLABELLED: Overactive bladder, often accompanied by urinary incontinence, is most prevalent among the elderly, but also affects many middle-aged men and women in the US.
