These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors  We found that macroH2A1 was depleted on the transcribed regions of active genes  Similar results were found for the L41gene, with enrichment of mH2A in the promoter region.
The centrosomal pool of macroH2A1 accumulates in the presence of an inhibitor of the 20S proteasome.
The data show that mH2A1 is uniformly distributed across the entire Xi chromosome.
In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome  Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes.
In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies.
Although macroH2A1 nucleosomes are widely distributed across the genome, their local concentration varies over a range of 100-fold or more  macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5  end of pro-pol.
