We further demonstrated that CHIR99021, a GSK-3 inhibitor reversed the suppressive effects of hUC-MSCs on HCCC-9810 cells and increased the expression of - catenin.
When administered together, wortmannin and trichostatin A completely negated the inhibitory effect of DEX on the differentiation-related cell cycle.
While cross talk between the Wnt / - catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways has been proposed, the impact of PI3K/AKT inhibition on - catenin signaling in glioma remains unknown.
In this study, we show that molecular cross-talk between the beta-catenin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase / Akt signaling pathways is crucial to sustain medulloblastoma pathophysiology.
Our current goal was to engage canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling at the receptor level to significantly increase human - cell proliferation while maintaining a - cell phenotype in intact islets.
Another pathway regulating proliferation and survival is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase / Akt pathway.
These data demonstrate that Wnt and insulin signaling pathways exhibit cross-talk at multiple levels.
Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF -1 receptors.
These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways.
Canonical WNT signals are transduced through Frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 coreceptor to downregulate GSK3beta activity not depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation.
