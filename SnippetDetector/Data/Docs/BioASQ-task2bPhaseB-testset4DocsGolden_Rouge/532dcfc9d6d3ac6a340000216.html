histone modification is catalyzed by protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs).
PKMTs contain a conserved SET domain (PMID: 17517655) SET domain, first identified within and named after proteins encoded by three Drosophila genes [Su(var)3-9, E(z), and Trithorax], is recognized as a signature motif for histone methyltransferases (PMID: 15659850) SET domain contains the catalytic center of lysine methyltransferases that target the N-terminal tails of histones and regulate chromatin function (PMID: 12389038) C-terminal SET domain that catalyzes methylation of histone H3 (PMID: 23652029) not all members of the H3K4 methyltransferase family contain n-SET domains (PMID: 23453808).
