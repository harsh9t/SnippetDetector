Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a worldwide health problem causing serious complications, such as liver cirrhosis and hepatoma.
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have been reported to suppress gene expression significantly.
HCV seems a suitable candidate for targets of siRNAs, as HCV is a positive single-strand RNA virus and replicates in the cytoplasm.
Based on results, nowadays there are few HCV replication inhibitors such as GS-563253, PSI-6130, NA-808, BMS-790052, GS-9132 and BMS-788329.
