Kabat Database was initially started in 1970 to determine the combining site of antibodies based on the available amino acid sequences at that time.
amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering (NUMEROTATION) that are used in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB cards, results of contact analysis and renumbered flat files.
the basis of comparative studies of known antibody structures and sequences it has been argued that there is a small repertoire of main-chain conformations for at least five of the six hypervariable regions of antibodies, and that the particular conformation adopted is determined by a few key conserved residues.
Standardized sequence and structure analysis of antibody using IMGT(Β®) databases and tools allows one to bridge, for the first time, the gap between antibody sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures.
This is achieved through the IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of classification (IMGT gene and allele nomenclature), description (IMGT standardized labels), and numerotation (IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles).
