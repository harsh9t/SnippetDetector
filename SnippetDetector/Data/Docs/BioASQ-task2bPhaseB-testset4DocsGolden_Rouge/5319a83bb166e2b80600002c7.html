Emulsion PCR-coupled target enrichment: an effective fishing method for high-throughput sequencing of poorly preserved ancient DNA.
We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing.
The method made it possible to obtain efficiently non-duplicated reads mapped to target sequences of interest, and this can achieve deep and reliable sequencing of ancient DNA from typical materials, even though poorly preserved.
(PMID: 23900195) Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR.
Briefly, amplified libraries carrying unique barcodes are prepared by fluorescent tagging of complementary sequences and then resolved by high-speed flow cytometric sorting of labeled emulsion PCR beads.
