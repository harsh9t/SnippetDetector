(STAT3) is critical for cancer progression by regulating tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
Herein, we investigated the regulation of STAT3 activation and the therapeutic effects of Icaritin, a prenyl flavonoid derivative from Epimedium Genus, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Overall, these results suggest that Icaritin strongly inhibits STAT3 activation and is a potentially effective therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 24324713) (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus.
However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis.
It regulates cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis (PMID: 24199193) STAT3) signaling pathway plays important roles in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, immunity, and tumor cell invasion.
In the present study, we investigated the association of interleukin (PMID: 24116074).
