Centromere protein -A (CENPA) is a centromere-specific histone-H3-like variant gene involved in regulating chromosome segregation during cell division (PMID: 24213134) CENP-A is an essential histone H3-like protein that localizes to the centromeric region of eukaryotic chromosomes (PMID: 12906131) sing a previously isolated mouse centromere protein A (Cenpa) probe, we have localized the gene to the proximal region of mouse Chromosome 5, between the known Il6 and Yes1 loci near [Adra2C-D5H4S43-Hdh] (PMID: 9605877).
