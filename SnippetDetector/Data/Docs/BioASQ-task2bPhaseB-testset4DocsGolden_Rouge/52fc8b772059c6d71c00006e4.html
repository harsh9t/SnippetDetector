We have discovered that 8-halo-4-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenylamino)-6-[(1H-[1,2,3]triazol-4-ylmethyl)-amino]-quinoline-3-carbonitriles (4) are potent inhibitors of this enzyme  a novel class of selective Tpl2 kinase inhibitors: 4-Alkylamino-[1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles  have previously reported the discovery and initial SAR of the [1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles and quinoline-3-carbonitriles as Tumor Progression Loci-2 (Tpl2) kinase inhibitors  Optimization of these cyclic amine groups led to the identification of 8-chloro-4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-6-((1-(1-ethylpiperidin-4-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methylamino)quinoline-3-carbonitrile (34)   novel quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives as Tpl2 kinase inhibitors.
