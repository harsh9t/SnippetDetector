(DSIF), is involved in regulating the processivity of RNA polymerase II.
DSIF plays also a role in transcriptional activation, and in concert with the negative elongation factor NELF causes promoter proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II  (NELF) and 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) are involved in pausing RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in the promoter-proximal region  NA polymerase II (Pol II) and the pausing complex, NELF and DSIF, are detected near the transcription start site (TSS) of many active and silent genes.
