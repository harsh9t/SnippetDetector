the specialization imparted by histone H2A (H2A.
X and H2A.
Z) variants to the nucleosome core particle constitutes the earliest response to DNA damage in the cell (PMID: 22253857)  phosphorylation of H2AX, a DNA damage signal (PMID: 21700704) H2A.
Z incorporation in the coding regions of genes encoding proteins involved in the regulation of meiosis and genotoxic stress responses (PMID: 21901086) H2AX has a complete SQ(E/D)varphi (where varphi denotes a hydrophobic residue) known to be phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (PMID: 19607843) H1 variant, H1R is involved in DNA damage response (PMID: 17613284) H2A variants, H2AX and H2AZ.
H2AX is phosphorylated on a serine four residues from the carboxyl terminus in response to the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (PMID: 11893489).
