The onset of bleeding was compared with the lunar phase.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients admitted to the department of neurosurgery during 1992 and 2004 suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
RESULTS: We found no correlation between incidence of aneurysmal SAH, location of the aneurysm, initial clinical presentation, or amount of subarachnoid blood and the lunar cycle.
CONCLUSION: The lunar cycle seems to affect the incidence of intracranial aneurysm rupture, with the new moon being associated with an increased risk of aneurysmal SAH.
Therefore, the present study investigates the influence of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal rupture, the initial clinical presentation, and the amount of subarachnoid blood.
BACKGROUND: Several external and internal risk factors for cerebral aneurysm rupture have been identified to date.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of the lunar cycle and season on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The date of aneurysm rupture was matched with the corresponding season and moon phase.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 111 patients who were admitted over a 5-year period to our department because of aneurysmal SAH were retrospectively reviewed.
