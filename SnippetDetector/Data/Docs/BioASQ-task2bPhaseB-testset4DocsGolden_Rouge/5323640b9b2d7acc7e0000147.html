It is also possible that the brainstem migraine area is involved in CADASIL.
OBJECTIVE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy is a small vessel disease of the brain caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene.
NOTCH3, the gene involved in CADASIL, encodes a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed in systemic arterial smooth-muscle cells.
Our results suggest that common migraine is not caused by any known CADASIL mutations in the NOTCH3 gene of interest.
To investigate the migraine locus around the C19p13 region through analysis of the NOTCH3 gene, previously shown to be a gene involved in CADASIL and the TNFSF7 gene ( C19p13 ), homologous to the ligands of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, genes that have previously been associated with migraine.
Notch proteins are involved in a very conserved signaling system with a broad spectrum of functions, from cell proliferation and differentiation to apoptosis.
the TNFSF7 gene displayed signs of involvement in a MO affected population and indicates that further independent studies of this marker are warranted.
The TNFSF7 gene was investigated through SNP association analysis using a matched case-control migraine population.
We reported twenty-one NOTCH3 pathogenic mutations identified in 53 index Italian patients.
