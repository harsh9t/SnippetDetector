OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of the lunar cycle and season on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: The lunar cycle seems to affect the incidence of intracranial aneurysm rupture, with the new moon being associated with an increased risk of aneurysmal SAH.
BACKGROUND: Several external and internal risk factors for cerebral aneurysm rupture have been identified to date.
Recently, it has been reported that moon phases correlate with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage another author found no such association.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients admitted to the department of neurosurgery during 1992 and 2004 suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The date of aneurysm rupture was matched with the corresponding season and moon phase.
CONCLUSIONS: The moon influences neither the incidence of aneurysmal SAH nor the grade of initial neurological deterioration or amount of subarachnoid blood.
METHODS: Lunar phase and the particular day of the lunar cycle were correlated to the date of aneurysm rupture, aneurysm location, initial clinical presentation, and amount of subarachnoid blood assessed from CT scans of all patients treated for basal SAH in our department from 2003 to 2010.
The onset of bleeding was compared with the lunar phase.
