To further elucidate the precise mechanisms of SB's antitumor activity, using a colorectal cancer mouse xenograft model in the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and molecular mechanisms of EESB against tumor growth.
In this study, we investigated the role of IL-27 in regulating EMT and angiogenesis through modulation of the STAT pathways in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells.
Collectively, our findings suggest that inhibition of tumor angiogenesis via suppression of multiple signaling pathways might be one of the mechanisms whereby UA can be effective in cancer treatment.
compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 is critical for cancer progression by regulating tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
6 / STAT3 signaling pathway with T lymphocytes and clinical implication in patients with gastric cancer.
Furthermore, UA suppressed the activation of sonic hedgehog, STAT3, Akt and p70S6K pathways.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and insulin-like growth factor 2 expression were positively correlated with microvessel density in all specimens.
Phosphorylated STAT3 dimers accumulate in the nucleus and drive the expression of genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, invasion, and proliferation.
