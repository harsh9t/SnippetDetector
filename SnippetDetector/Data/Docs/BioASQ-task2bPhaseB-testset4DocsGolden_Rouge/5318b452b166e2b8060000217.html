Whole exome sequencing is sensitive, rapid and efficient for detection of PCC/PGL germline mutations.
Whole exome sequencing is an efficient and sensitive method for detection of germline mutations in patients with phaeochromcytomas and paragangliomas (PMID: 24102379) These results from deep sequencing demonstrate a higher mutational detection rate than reported with conventional sequencing methodology.
(PMID: 23832012) We performed exome sequencing of germline DNA from members of the affected family.
Exome-wide analysis identified a novel loss-of-function mutation in the BAP1 gene, previously suggested as a tumor suppressor.
(PMID: 23341325) whole-exome sequencing has been widely applied in the identification of germline mutations underlying Mendelian disorders, somatic mutations in various cancers and de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders.
