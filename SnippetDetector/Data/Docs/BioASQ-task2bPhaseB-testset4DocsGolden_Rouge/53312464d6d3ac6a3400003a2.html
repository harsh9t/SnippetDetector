Completion of genome sequences for many organisms allows a reasonably complete definition of the complement of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.
In mammals this  core matrisome  comprises β�Ό300 proteins.
Over 300 ECM molecules have been defined as comprising the  core matrisome  in mammals through the analysis of whole genome sequences.
we have developed a bioinformatic approach to predict the in silico  matrisome  defined as the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors.
