The phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (gammaH2AX) is one of the best examples of histone PTMs in response to DNA damage induction  H2A.
X, plays a very important role in the cellular response to DNA damage  H2A variants, H2AX and H2AZ.
H2AX is phosphorylated on a serine four residues from the carboxyl terminus in response to the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks  the specialization imparted by histone H2A (H2A.
X and H2A.
Z) variants to the nucleosome core particle constitutes the earliest response to DNA damage in the cell  H2A.
X is an H2A variant present in multicellular organisms that is specifically phosphorylated on the serine in the C-terminal consensus sequence, canonically  SQEY,  in response to DNA damage.
histone variants (H2AX and H2A.
Z), histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination) and chromatin-remodeling complexes (INO80, SWR1, SWI/SNF, RSC and NuRD) are important and direct players in the DNA double-strand break (DSB).
