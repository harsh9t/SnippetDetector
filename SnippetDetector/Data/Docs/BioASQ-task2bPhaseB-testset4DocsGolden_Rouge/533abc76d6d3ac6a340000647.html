One important pathway regulated by Bmi-1 is that involving two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) (PMID: 20551323) p16INK4a and p14ARF tumor suppressors, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (h-TERT), and oncoprotein c-Myc have been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation mediated by PcG proteins, mainly Bmi-1 (PMID: 17145810) increased frequency to a telomere-independent senescent state mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a).
p16(INK4a) expression was regulated by the Polycomb group repressor Bmi-1 (PMID: 16537449).
