Genetic BRCA2 insufficiency is associated with breast cancer development; however, in sporadic breast cancer cases, high BRCA2 expression is paradoxically correlated with poor prognosis (PMID: 24289229) Network analysis showed increased expression of a majority of components in p53 and BRCA1 subnetworks in AA breast tumor samples, and members of the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling pathways were also highly expressed (PMID: 24324792) These results indicate that nuclear NRF2 protein plays important roles in the proliferation and/or progression of breast carcinoma, and nuclear NRF2 immunoreactivity is therefore considered a potent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients (PMID: 24302665) many molecular components that regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator.
Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key recombinase in HR (PMID: 23678008) HER-2 and TOP2A gene amplification showed a tendency to be associated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, high level of apoptotic and proliferative indexes, and low level of p53 and Bcl-2 expression, which all together indicate group of patients with similar outcome during the progression of the disease (PMID: 24272208).
