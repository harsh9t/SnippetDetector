Myocardial MTOR activity changes during hypertrophy and heart failure (HF).
When subjected to pressure overload, Mtor-ablated mice demonstrated an impaired hypertrophic response and accelerated HF progression.
Our results demonstrate a role for the MTORC1 signaling network in the myocardial response to stress.
In particular, they highlight the role of 4E-BP1 in regulating cardiomyocyte viability and in HF.
Because the effects of reduced MTOR activity were mediated through increased 4E-BP1 inhibitory activity, blunting this mechanism may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac function in clinical HF.
