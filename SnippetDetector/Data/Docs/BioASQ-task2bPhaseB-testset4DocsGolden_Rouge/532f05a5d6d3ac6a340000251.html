Ranolazine is an innovative anti-ischemic and antianginal agent that inhibits the late Na current, thereby reducing the Na-dependent Ca-overload, which improves diastolic tone and oxygen handling during myocardial ischemia.
In addition, ranolazine seems to exert beneficial effects on diastolic cardiac function.
(PMID: 22767404) Ranolazine improves cardiac diastolic dysfunction through modulation of myofilament calcium sensitivity (PMID: 22343711) Diastolic dysfunction could be reversed by ranolazine, probably resulting from a direct effect on myofilaments, indicating that cardiac oxidative stress may mediate diastolic dysfunction through altering the contractile apparatus.
(PMID: 22343711) Data from in vitro and animal studies indicate that ranolazine improves diastolic function by inhibiting the late sodium current.
(PMID: 21538388) New clinical and experimental studies even point to potential antiarrhythmic effects, beneficial effects in diastolic heart failure, and under hyperglycemic conditions.
