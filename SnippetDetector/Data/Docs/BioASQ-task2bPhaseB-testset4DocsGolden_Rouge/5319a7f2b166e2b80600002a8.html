Tuberous sclerosis complex is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome caused by mutations in TSC1 and TSC2.
Hamartin and tuberin, the products of TSC1 and TSC2, respectively, form heterodimers and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin.
Plk1 interacts with the N-terminus of hamartin, which contains two potential Plk1-binding sites ( T310 and S332 ).
Phosphorylated hamartin interacts with Plk1 independent of tuberin with all three proteins present in a complex.
Hamartin negatively regulates the protein levels of Plk1.
These data reveal a novel subcellular localization for hamartin and a novel interaction partner for the hamartin/tuberin complex and implicate hamartin and mTOR in the regulation of centrosome duplication.
A non-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant with an alanine substitution at residue T310 does not interact with Plk1, whereas a non-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant at residue S332 in conjunction with alanine mutations at the other CDC2/cyclin B1 sites does not impact hamartin binding to Plk1.
Previously, we have shown that hamartin is phosphorylated by CDC2/cyclin B1 during the G / M phase of the cell cycle.
RNAi inhibition of Plk1 in Tsc1 MEFs failed to rescue the increased centrosome number phenotype.
Both phenotypes are rescued after pre-treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.
