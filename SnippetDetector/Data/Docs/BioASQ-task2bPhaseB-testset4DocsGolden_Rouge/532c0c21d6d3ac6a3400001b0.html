A pharmacophore describes the arrangement of molecular features a ligand must contain to efficaciously bind a receptor.
Pharmacophore models are developed to improve molecular understanding of ligandβ€“protein interactions, and can be used as a tool to identify novel compounds that fulfil the pharmacophore requirements and have a high probability of being biologically active.
Protein structure-based pharmacophores (SBPs) derive these molecular features by conversion of protein properties to reciprocal ligand space.
Unlike ligand-based pharmacophore models, which require templates of ligands in their bioactive conformation, SBPs do not depend on ligand information.
