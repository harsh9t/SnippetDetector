We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing.
The method made it possible to obtain efficiently non-duplicated reads mapped to target sequences of interest, and this can achieve deep and reliable sequencing of ancient DNA from typical materials, even though poorly preserved.
Emulsion PCR-coupled target enrichment: an effective fishing method for high-throughput sequencing of poorly preserved ancient DNA  Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX.
Prior to SOLiD sequencing reaction, the libraries were amplified with emulsion PCR and enriched with the P2 enrichment beads.
The library samples were loaded to sequencing Chip for Work Flow Analysis (WFA) or sequencing running with default parameters.
