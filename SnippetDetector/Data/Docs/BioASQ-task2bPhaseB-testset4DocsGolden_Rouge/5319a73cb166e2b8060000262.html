The molecular chaperone heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90 is an important anticancer drug target because it maintains the conformation, stability, and function of many important oncogenic client proteins, including those involved with signal transduction, cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, motility angiogenesis, and metastasis.
Using the standard inhibitors of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of Hsp90, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17- demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), novel solid-phase immunoassays have been validated using a time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) end point.
Their utility for confirming the mechanism of action of Hsp90 inhibition in secondary cell-based assays has been shown and applied to the novel Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159.
Geldanamycin (HSP90 inhibitor)  the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin  Unique proteome patterns were observed in HeLa cells treated with the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, and were similar to the patterns induced by radicicol, a structurally different HSP90 inhibitor.
An Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor, geldanamycin, inhibits luciferase reactivation demonstrating the importance of the ATP-dependent chaperone activity of E.
