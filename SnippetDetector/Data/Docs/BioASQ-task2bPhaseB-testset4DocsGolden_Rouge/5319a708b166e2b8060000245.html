The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates many basic cellular processes and has been proven to be a promising target for cancer therapy.
Bortezomib is the first U.
S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma.
Validation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a target for cancer therapy has come in the form of approvals of the first such inhibitor, bortezomib, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this agent has become a standard of care.
