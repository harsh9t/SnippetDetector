One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB)  Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A  These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors  Similar results were found for the L41gene, with enrichment of mH2A in the promoter region.
In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome  Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes.
Although macroH2A1 nucleosomes are widely distributed across the genome, their local concentration varies over a range of 100-fold or more  macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5  end of pro-pol.
