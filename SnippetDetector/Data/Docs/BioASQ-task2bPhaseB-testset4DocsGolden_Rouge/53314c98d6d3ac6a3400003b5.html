Deregulation of scribble promotes mammary tumorigenesis and reveals a role for cell polarity in carcinoma.
(PMID: 19041750) Scribble expression is decreased in many invasive human cancers.
(PMID: 18641685) we demonstrate that scribble inhibits breast cancer formation and that deregulation of polarity pathways promotes dysplastic and neoplastic growth in mammals by disrupting morphogenesis and inhibiting cell death.
