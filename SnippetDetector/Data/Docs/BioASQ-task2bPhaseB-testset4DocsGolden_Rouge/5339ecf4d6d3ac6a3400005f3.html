It is possible to conclude that there is a high prevalence of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with high-risk or recovered from cardiac sudden death, like those with clinical indication to implantable cardioverter -defibrillator.
Late gadolinium enhancement by CMR has prognostic value in predicting adverse cardiovascular events among HCM patients.
There are significant relationships between LGE and cardiovascular mortality, heart failure death, and all-cause mortality in HCM.
Additionally, LGE and SCD/aborted SCD displayed a trend toward significance.
