transcription and splicing are functionally intertwined, and that modified nucleosomes with trimethylation of lysine 36 in histone subunit 3 (H3K36me3) are enriched at internal exons and the downstream flanking intronic regions of highly expressed genes (PMID: 19823040) histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a single polyadenylation site.
(PMID: 23740743) ChIP-sequencing data mapped onto skipped exon events reveal a correlation between histone H3K36 trimethylation peaks and skipped exons, suggesting epigenetic marks being part of alternative splicing regulation.
(PMID: 23676078) Genome-wide analysis of histone methylation in human cell lines and mouse primary T cells reveals that intron-containing genes are preferentially marked with histone H3 Lys36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) (PMID: 21792193).
