Prior to SOLiD sequencing reaction, the libraries were amplified with emulsion PCR and enriched with the P2 enrichment beads.
The motivation of this research is to establish a system of target genomic DNA capture and enrichment, which could be used in deep sequencing of target regions with next-generation sequencing.
This data was also compared to whole-exome sequencing data from ten individuals.
RainDance emulsion PCR and SureSelect RNA-bait hybridization capture enrichment methods were directly compared by enriching DNA from eight samples.
Next generation sequencing of exonic amplicons with the 454 genome sequence FLX System and Conexio Assign ATF 454 software provides high resolution, high throughput HLA genotyping for eight class I and class II loci.
All previously reported variants associated with mitochondrial disorders were found in validation samples, and 5 of the 13 clinical samples were found to have mutations associated with mitochondrial disorders in either the mitochondrial genome or the 108 nuclear genes.
Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX.
biased amplification of DNA templates might occur in the process of emulsion PCR, which results in production of artificial duplicate reads.
