Both phenotypes are rescued after pre-treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.
RNAi inhibition of Plk1 in Tsc1(-/-) MEFs failed to rescue the increased centrosome number phenotype.
These data reveal a novel subcellular localization for hamartin and a novel interaction partner for the hamartin/tuberin complex and implicate hamartin and mTOR in the regulation of centrosome duplication.
Phosphorylated hamartin interacts with Plk1 independent of tuberin with all three proteins present in a complex.
Finally, Tsc1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have increased number of centrosomes and increased DNA content, compared to Tsc1(+/+) cells.
Hamartin negatively regulates the protein levels of Plk1.
