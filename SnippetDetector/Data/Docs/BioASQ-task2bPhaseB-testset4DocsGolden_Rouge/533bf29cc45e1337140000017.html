The CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms have been noted as markers for tumour metastasis and prognosis in several adenocarcinomas.
(PMID: 10601048) Positive CD44v3 expression was associated with more advanced pathological stage and poorer prognosis than negative CD44v3 expression (PMID: 11751503) CD44v2 and CD44v6 may be useful markers for poor prognosis in curatively resected primary pancreatic cancer (PMID: 9849582) Certain splice variants (CD44v) can promote the metastatic behaviour of cancer cells.
In human colon and breast cancer the presence of epitopes encoded by exon v6 on primary resected tumour material indicates poor prognosis (PMID: 7587629).
