This review will summarize current knowledge of the small-molecule multiple-kinase inhibitors in lung cancer therapy.
These kinases are receptor kinases, which are transmembrane proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor or cytoplasmic kinases such as Src kinase.
Growth factor signals are propagated from the cell surface to intracellular processes that control critical functions such as growth, differentiation, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis via sequential kinase signaling.
Thus, they represent attractive targets for cancer therapy.
In malignancies, these signaling pathways are often exploited to optimize tumor growth and metastasis.
These inhibitors include ZD6474, SU11248, AEE 788, sorafenib, vatalanib, and AG-013736.
