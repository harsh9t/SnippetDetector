These include the histone H3 variant centromeric protein A (CENPA), the composition and deposition of which have been widely investigated  Centromere protein -A (CENPA) is a centromere-specific histone-H3-like variant gene involved in regulating chromosome segregation during cell division  ENP-A is an essential histone H3-like protein that localizes to the centromeric region of eukaryotic chromosomes  CENPA is a member of the histone H3-like proteins and is thought to replace histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes.
