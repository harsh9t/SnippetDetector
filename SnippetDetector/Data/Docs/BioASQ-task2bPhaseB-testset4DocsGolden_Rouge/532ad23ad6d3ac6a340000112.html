IMGT is a high quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrates, and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of any species which belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and to the MHC superfamily (MhcSF).
IMGT consists of five databases, ten on-line tools and more than 8,000 HTML pages of Web resources.
IMGT provides a common access to standardized data from genome, genetics, proteome and three-dimensional structures.
amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering (NUMEROTATION) that are used in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB cards, results of contact analysis and renumbered flat files.
(PMID: 19900967) Standardized sequence and structure analysis of antibody using IMGT((r)) databases and tools allows one to bridge, for the first time, the gap between antibody sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures.
This is achieved through the IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of classification (IMGT gene and allele nomenclature), description (IMGT standardized labels), and numerotation (IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles).
