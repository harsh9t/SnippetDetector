Late gadolinium enhancement by CMR has prognostic value in predicting adverse cardiovascular events among HCM patients.
There are significant relationships between LGE and cardiovascular mortality, heart failure death, and all-cause mortality in HCM.
Additionally, LGE and SCD/aborted SCD displayed a trend toward significance.
(PMID: 22498326) The hyperenhanced apical myocardium had a lower percentage of systolic myocardial thickening, and was associated with serious symptoms (e.
g.
syncope) and ventricular arrhythmias.
(PMID: 21498307)  It is possible to conclude that there is a high prevalence of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with high-risk or recovered from cardiac sudden death, like those with clinical indication to implantable cardioverter -defibrillator.
