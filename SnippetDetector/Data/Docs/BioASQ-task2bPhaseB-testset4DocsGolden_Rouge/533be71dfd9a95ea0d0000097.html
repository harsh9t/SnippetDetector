MLL1, MLL5, Set1 and ASH1 to be highly up-regulated during transdifferentiation of HSCs.
All of these histone methyltransferases regulate methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3, which is a signature of actively transcribed genes (PMID: 22488473) MLL1 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1), a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K4 residues (PMID: 22046413) MLL1 and MLL2 H3K4 methyltransferase complexes are tethered by p52 on the MMP9 but not on the IkappaBalpha promoter, and the H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity r (PMID: 19219072) MLL1 localizes with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the 5' end of actively transcribed genes, where histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation occurs (PMID: 15941828).
