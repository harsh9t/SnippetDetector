Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor.
The most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancer).
Other forms of breast cancer begin in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer) or in other parts of the breast.
Early breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms.
As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness.
These changes can occur as part of many different conditions, however.
Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.
In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body.
If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain.
Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.
A small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families.
Hereditary cancers are those associated with inherited gene mutations.
Hereditary breast cancers tend to occur earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases and are more likely to involve both breasts.
Variations of the BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCT, and P53 genes increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
The and NFR2, HER2 and TOP2A genes are associated with breast cancer.
