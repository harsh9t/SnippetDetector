The mechanisms underlying the human fetal-to-adult beta-globin gene switch remain to be determined.
The study of hemoglobin switching has represented a focus in hematology due in large part to the clinical relevance of the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch for developing targeted approaches to ameliorate the severity of the beta-haemoglobinopathies.
Their identification may clarify the mechanisms of the conversion from fetal to adult globin production and lead to new approaches to reversing or retarding the gamma - to beta-globin gene switch.
Treatment of adult blood-derived stem cells with transforming growth factor during the first 3-4 days in culture increases the proportions and absolute numbers of erythroid cells subsequently expressing fetal hemoglobin ( F + cells ).
We have evaluated human gamma - and beta-globin promoter methylation in primary human fetal liver and adult bone marrow ( ABM ) erythroid cells.
The persistence of fetal hemoglobin in many patients with deletion type beta thalassemias and the expression patterns of human globin genes in transgenic mice suggest that gamma - to beta-globin gene switching results primarily from competition of gamma - and beta-globin genes for interaction with the beta-globin locus control region.
Globin gene switching may be mediated by proteins expressed during different stages of development.
