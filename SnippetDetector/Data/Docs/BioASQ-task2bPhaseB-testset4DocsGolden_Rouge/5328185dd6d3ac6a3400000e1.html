The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a cluster of risk factors including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, The MetS is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
(PMID: 24320038) As a molecular link between metabolic signals, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction, resistin can be proposed as playing a significant role in the heightened inflammatory state induced by metabolic stress linked to excessive caloric intake, thus contributing to the risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
(PMID: 24320036) Metabolic disturbances are well-recognized clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) has been widely used as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
(PMID: 24328010) The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with a higher risk for both, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.
