We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing.
The method made it possible to obtain efficiently non-duplicated reads mapped to target sequences of interest, and this can achieve deep and reliable sequencing of ancient DNA from typical materials, even though poorly preserved.
