Ξ™vabradine decreases heart rate and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, increases diastolic perfusion time and improves energetics in ischemic myocardium.
Ivabradine protects the myocardium during ischemia, improves left ventricular function in heart failure and reduces remodeling following myocardial infarction.
It improves prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and heart rate β‰¥70 beats per minute, as well as in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction.
The beneficial effects of ivabradine may be due to the reversal of electrophysiological cardiac remodelling in post-MI rats by reduction of functional overexpression of HCN channels.
Furthermore, the improvement of cardiac function is related not only to the HR reduction per se but also to modifications in the extracellular matrix.
