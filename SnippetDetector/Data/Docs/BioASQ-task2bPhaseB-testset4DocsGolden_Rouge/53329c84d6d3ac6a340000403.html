Recent studies show that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins E and C have benefits in CHD prevention; however, supplementation with beta-carotene may have deleterious effects and is not recommended.
Current evidence suggests that patients with CHD would probably benefit from taking vitamin E in a dosage of 400 IU per day and vitamin C in a dosage of 500 to 1,000 mg per day.
Clinicians may also want to consider vitamin supplementation for CHD prevention in high-risk patients.
Folate lowers elevated homocysteine levels, but evidence for routine supplemental use does not yet exist.
