Our data demonstrate that engaging Wnt signaling at the receptor level by this method leads to necessary crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways including activation of Akt, mTOR, Wnt/b-catenin, PKA/CREB, and inhibition of RhoA/ROCK that substantially increase human b-cell proliferation while maintaining the b-cell phenotype.
(PMID: 23776620) The cross-talk role of Wnt/b-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with GSK-3b as the key enzyme bridging these pathways, may contribute to the inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cells by hUC-MSCs.
(PMID: 23646150) Small-molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin pathway cross-talk and suppress medulloblastoma growth (PMID: 20028853) Therefore, our findings unravel a novel molecular mechanism regulating the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of beta-catenin and provide new insights into the cross-talk between the Wnt and Akt signaling pathways.
(PMID: 19158508) Furthermore, DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity was attenuated in the presence of dominant negative forms of either PI3K or protein kinase B/Akt.
These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways.
