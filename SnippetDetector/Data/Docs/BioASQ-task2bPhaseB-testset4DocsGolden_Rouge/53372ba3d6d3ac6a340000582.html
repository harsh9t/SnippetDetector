In addition to coordinating the processing of the nascent transcript, elongating RNA polymerase II recruits histone methyltransferases to methylate lysines 4 and 36 of histone H3 in nucleosomes in the body of actively transcribed genes  RNA polymerase II signals for deacetylation through the methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36), which provides the recruitment signal for the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex (HDAC).
