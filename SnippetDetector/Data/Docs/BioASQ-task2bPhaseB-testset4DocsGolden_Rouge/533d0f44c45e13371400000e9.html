Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 is critical for cancer progression by regulating tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
BACKGROUND: The signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 signaling pathway plays important roles in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, immunity, and tumor cell invasion.
BACKGROUND: Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus.
METHODS: The expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and insulin-like growth factor 2 as well as microvessel density was measured in a series of tissue samples from 44 human sporadic adrenocortical tumors by immunohistochemistry.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aberrant activation of STAT3 is frequently encountered and promotes proliferation, survival, metastasis and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the development of solid tumors by supplying nutrients and oxygen to support continuous growth of tumor as well as providing an avenue for hematogenous metastasis.
Therefore, suppression of tumor angiogenesis through targeting these signaling pathways has become a promising strategy for cancer chemotherapy.
