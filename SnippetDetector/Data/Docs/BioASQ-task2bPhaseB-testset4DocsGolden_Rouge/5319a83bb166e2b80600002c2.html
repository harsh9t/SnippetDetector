We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing.
The method made it possible to obtain efficiently non-duplicated reads mapped to target sequences of interest, and this can achieve deep and reliable sequencing of ancient DNA from typical materials, even though poorly preserved.
Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR.
Emulsion PCR-coupled target enrichment: an effective fishing method for high-throughput sequencing of poorly preserved ancient DNA  Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX.
However, pyrosequencing of emulsion PCR reactions, amplifying from only one molecule at a time, can generate megabases of clonally amplified loci at high coverage, thereby greatly simplifying allelic sequence determination.
