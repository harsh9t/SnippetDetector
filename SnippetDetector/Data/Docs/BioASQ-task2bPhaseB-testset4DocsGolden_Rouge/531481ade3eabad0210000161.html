We have evaluated human gamma - and beta-globin promoter methylation in primary human fetal liver and adult bone marrow ( ABM ) erythroid cells.
The expression of epsilon - and gamma-globin mRNA and protein has been determined in three Old World monkey species.
Beta-thalassemia is a genetic, red blood cell disorder affecting the beta-globin chain of the adult hemoglobin gene.
The study of hemoglobin switching has represented a focus in hematology due in large part to the clinical relevance of the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch for developing targeted approaches to ameliorate the severity of the beta-haemoglobinopathies.
The change in F + cell proportions may be due to globin switching or to selective effects on the expansion of stem cell subpopulations with different globin expression programs.
The persistence of fetal hemoglobin in many patients with deletion type beta thalassemias and the expression patterns of human globin genes in transgenic mice suggest that gamma - to beta-globin gene switching results primarily from competition of gamma - and beta-globin genes for interaction with the beta-globin locus control region.
Studies of these natural mutants associated with increased synthesis of HbF in adult life have provided considerable insight into the understanding of the control of globin gene expression and Hb switching.
