CONCLUSIONS: By quantifying the total economic costs of overactive bladder and stress urinary incontinence, this study provides an important perspective in Korea.
Because the average age of the Korean population is rapidly increasing, this study provides important information on the direct and indirect costs of overactive bladder and stress urinary incontinence for an aging society.
RESULTS: The estimated total economic cost in treating overactive bladder was 117 billion Korean Won in 2006 and 145 billion KRW in 2007.
An estimated 60 % of women with incontinence in 1998 were aged 40 years or over.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary incontinence imposes a considerable drain on Australian healthcare resources.
The estimated total cost was sensitive to the estimated prevalence of OAB; therefore, we calculated the average cost per community-dwelling person with OAB, which was 267 dollars per year.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic cost of urinary incontinence in community-dwelling Australian women aged 18 years and over for the year 1998.
OAB may severely impair quality of life, and its overall economic costs to society are substantial.
Studies assessing the impact of UI on HRQoL of patients with an underlying neurologic condition of interest were included.
In addition, urgency UI also results in substantial economic costs.
