a novel class of selective Tpl2 kinase inhibitors: 4-Alkylamino-[1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles   novel quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives as Tpl2 kinase inhibitors  Initial 4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitrile leads showed poor selectivity for Tpl2   have previously reported the discovery and initial SAR of the [1,7]naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles and quinoline-3-carbonitriles as Tumor Progression Loci-2 (Tpl2) kinase inhibitors  We have discovered that 8-halo-4-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenylamino)-6-[(1H-[1,2,3]triazol-4-ylmethyl)-amino]-quinoline-3-carbonitriles (4) are potent inhibitors of this enzyme   selectivity and in vivo antiinflammatory activity of novel 8-substituted-4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitriles  report here the synthesis and SAR of a new series of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines as potent Tpl2 kinase inhibitors  identified a novel series of 2,4-disubstituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridines as COT kinase inhibitors.
