These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways.
In this study, we show that molecular cross-talk between the beta-catenin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase / Akt signaling pathways is crucial to sustain medulloblastoma pathophysiology.
In the present study, we have investigated cross-talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways using preadipocytes with and without knockdown of the Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 and with and without knock-out of insulin and IGF-1 receptors.
Here, we show that compartmentalization by Axin of GSK3 prohibits cross-talk between the PI3K and Wnt pathways and that Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity is not modulated by activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway.
Chibby is an evolutionarily conserved antagonist of beta-catenin, a central player of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which acts as a transcriptional coactivator.
Another pathway regulating proliferation and survival is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase / Akt pathway.
Disturbed Wnt signaling has been implicated in numerous diseases, including type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.
Direct inhibition of GSK-3, that engages Wnt signaling downstream of the Wnt receptor, increases - catenin nuclear translocation and - cell proliferation but results in lower insulin content.
This treatment also increased expression of Nr4a2 and Irs2 and resulted in phosphorylation of Akt.
