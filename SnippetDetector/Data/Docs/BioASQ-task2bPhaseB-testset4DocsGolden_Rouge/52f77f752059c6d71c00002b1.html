PALB2 interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2 in supercomplexes involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination.
XRCC3 is a RAD51 paralog that functions in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination ( HR ).
Defects in components of DSB repair pathways are associated with a predisposition to cancer.
Mismatch repair has a central role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA replication errors and inhibiting recombination between non-identical sequences.
Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer.
Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.
No difference in recombination was detected between two isogenic cell lines that only differed in DNA mismatch repair capability.
These proteins are highly conserved DNA helicases, which have diverse roles in multiple DNA metabolic processes such as DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair.
DNA-repair pathways recognize and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous agents to maintain genomic integrity.
