Centromere protein A (Cenpa for mouse, CENP-A for other species) is an essential histone H3-like protein that localizes to the centromeric region of eukaryotic chromosomes, where it replaces conventional histone H3 and together with centromere-specific-DNA-binding factors directs the assembly of active kinetochores.
