Data from in vitro and animal studies indicate that ranolazine improves diastolic function by inhibiting the late sodium current.
Ranolazine is an innovative anti-ischemic and antianginal agent that reduces the Na-dependent Ca-overload, which improves diastolic tone and oxygen handling during myocardial ischemia.
Furthermore, ranolazine improves cardiac diastolic dysfunction through modulation of myofilament calcium sensitivity.
