HGF-induced activation of c-Met is playing a pivotal role in the stimulation of c-Src activation, resulting in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85Ξ±/p110Ξ± and p85Ξ±/p110Ξ΄, which is required for Akt-mediated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, with consequent inhibition of IΞΊB kinase and nuclear factor-ΞΊB activation, resulting in enhanced cell survival.
