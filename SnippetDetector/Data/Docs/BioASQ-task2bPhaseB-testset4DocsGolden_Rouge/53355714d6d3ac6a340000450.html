Traditional central processing unist (CPUs) are reaching their limit in processing power and are not designed primarily for multithreaded applications.
Graphics processing units (GPUs) on the other hand are affordable, scalable computer powerhouses that, thanks to the ever increasing demand for higher quality graphics, have yet to reach their limit.
Typically high-end CPUs have 8-16 cores, whereas GPUs can have more than 2,500 cores.
GPUs are also, by design, highly parallel, multicore and multithreaded, able of handling thousands of threads doing the same calculation on different subsets of a large data set.
This ability is what makes them perfectly suited for biological analysis tasks.
Lately this potential has been realized by many bioinformatics researches and a huge variety of tools and algorithms have been ported to GPUs, or designed from the ground up to maximize the usage 
of available cores.
