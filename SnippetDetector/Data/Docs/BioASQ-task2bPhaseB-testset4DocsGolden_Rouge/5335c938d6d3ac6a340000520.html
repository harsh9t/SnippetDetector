The estimated total economic cost in treating overactive bladder was 117 billion Korean Won (KRW, the currency of South Koea) in 2006 and 145 billion KRW in 2007.
The estimated total cost in treating stress urinary incontinence was 122 billion KRW in 2006 and 59 billion KRW in 2007.
The estimated total economic cost of OAB was 12.
02 billion dollars in 2000, with 9.
17 and 2.
85 billion dollars incurred in the community and institutions, respectively.
Community female and male OAB costs totaled 7.
37 and 1.
79 billion dollars, respectively.
The estimated total cost was sensitive to the estimated prevalence of OAB; therefore, we calculated the average cost per community-dwelling person with OAB, which was 267 dollars per year.
An estimated 1835628 community-dwelling women over the age of 18 years had urinary incontinence in 1998.
The total annual cost of this urinary incontinence is estimated at $710.
44 million, or $387 per incontinent woman, comprising $338.
47 million in treatment costs and $371.
97 million in personal costs.
An estimated 60% of women with incontinence in 1998 were aged 40 years or over.
Assuming the prevalence of incontinence remains constant and, allowing for inflation, we project that the total annual cost in 20 years' time will be $1267.
85 million, 93% ($1.
18 billion) of which will constitute costs associated with women aged over 40 years.
For individuals 65 years of age and older these costs are substantial, increasing from $8.
2 billion (1984 dollars) to $16.
4 billion (1993 dollars).
The 1995 societal cost of incontinence for individuals aged 65 years and older was $26.
3 billion, or $3565 per individual with urinary incontinence.
