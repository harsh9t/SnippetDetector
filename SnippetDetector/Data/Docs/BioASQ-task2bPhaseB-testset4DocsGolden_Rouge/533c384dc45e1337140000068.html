We studied the enrichment and distribution of the histone variant mH2A1 in the condensed inactive X chromosome.
One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body ( MCB ).
In many instances incorporation of histone variants results in formation of specialized regions of chromatin.
Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A.
In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome.
Studies of macroH2A histone variants indicate that they have a role in regulating gene expression.
Macro H2A is a histone variant that has two different subtypes in vertebrates: mH2A1 and mH2A2.
Using a novel thiol affinity chromatography approach to purify macroH2A1-containing chromatin fragments, we examined the distribution of macroH2A1 histone variants in mouse liver chromatin.
We show that macroH2A1 histone variants are important for repressing the expression of endogenous murine leukemia viruses in mouse liver.
These genes functionally cluster in the area of lipid metabolism.
