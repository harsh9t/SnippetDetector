The first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to four new species are still being found every year  Mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and filariasis are the main contributors to this burden  Re-emergence of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and yellow fever, which are both transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, has been correlated with insecticide resistance.
Sylvatic cycles of both viruses remain active, and where the two viruses overlap in West Africa they utilize similar suites of monkeys and Aedes mosquitoes  Finally, transmission of YFV among humans has been documented only in Africa and the Americas, whereas DENV is transmitted among humans across most of the range of competent Aedes vectors, which in the last decade has included every continent save Antarctica  United States made 12 million visits to developing countries in Asia, South America, Central America, Oceania, the Middle East, and Africa.
