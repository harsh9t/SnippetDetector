Bromodomains bind acetylated lysines, acting as readers of the histone-acetylation code (PMID: 21851057) bromodomain proteins bind to acetylated lysines in histones (PMID: 21189220) Bromodomains are present in many chromatin-associated proteins such as the SWI/SNF and RSC chromatin remodelling and the SAGA HAT (histone acetyltransferase) complexes, and can bind to acetylated lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of the histones (PMID: 17049045) recognition of acetylated histones by bromodomains (PMID: 17049045).
