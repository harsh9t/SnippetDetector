The phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (gammaH2AX) is one of the best examples of histone PTMs in response to DNA damage induction  H2A.
X, plays a very important role in the cellular response to DNA damage  the specialization imparted by histone H2A (H2A.
X and H2A.
Z) variants to the nucleosome core particle constitutes the earliest response to DNA damage in the cell  histone variants (H2AX and H2A.
Z), histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination) and chromatin-remodeling complexes (INO80, SWR1, SWI/SNF, RSC and NuRD) are important and direct players in the DNA double-strand break (DSB)  activation of DNA damage checkpoints (ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and H2A histone family, member X (H2AFX (H2AFX))).
