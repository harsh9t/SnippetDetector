(STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus.
It is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription.
Under normal physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated.
However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis.
It regulates cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis.
