C-terminal Hsp-interacting protein (CHIP) is an HSP70 and HSP90 interacting co-chaperone and an E3 ubiquitin ligase.
Previous studies have reported the role of CHIP in cancer progression by targeting protein degradation.
(PMID: 23429937) The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) binds Hsp90 and/or Hsp70 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), facilitating ubiquitination of the chaperone-bound client proteins.
(PMID: 23344957) The E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) is believed to be a central player in the cellular triage decision, as it links the molecular chaperones Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90 to the ubiquitin proteasomal degradation pathway.
