Apixaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, and is a potential alternative for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism.
Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered in fixed doses, may simplify the treatment of venous thromboembolism.
A fixed-dose regimen of apixaban alone was noninferior to conventional therapy for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and was associated with significantly less bleeding Nowadays, the new anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, show potential advantages over classical treatments.
These results suggest a lack of clear superiority of apixaban relative to enoxaparin.
Apixaban is an oral alternative with similar efficacy and safety to existing anticoagulant therapies.
In a recently completed phase III trial, apixaban also demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in that indication.
