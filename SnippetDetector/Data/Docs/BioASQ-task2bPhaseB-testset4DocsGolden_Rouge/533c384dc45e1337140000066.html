macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.
(PMID: 17570398) macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5' end of pro-pol (PMID: 18195046) In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies.
(PMID: 16738309) One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB) (PMID: 12082075) In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome (PMID: 12082075) The centrosomal pool of macroH2A1 accumulates in the presence of an inhibitor of the 20S proteasome.
