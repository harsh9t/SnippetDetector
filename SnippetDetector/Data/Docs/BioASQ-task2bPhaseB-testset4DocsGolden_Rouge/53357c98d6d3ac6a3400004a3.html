Recent reports have found that the genetic variation in chemokine encoding genes are associated with risk of breast cancer.
Cyclin E, HER-2 and p53, are considered as major prognostic markers in breast cancer.
In humans, mutations in the gene for the breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 affect its interactions with the recombinase RAD51 and are associated with an increased risk of cancer.
BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancers do not represent a single disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses.
As they are related in patho-clinical level, we aimed to check if they have any direct interaction on expression of each other.
This study addresses if TRIM22 expression is de-regulated in breast carcinoma.
The effect of DSS1 was examined in breast cancer cells in vitro.
UNLABELLED: The aim of our study was to investigate HER-2 and TOP2A gene status and their correlation with Bcl-2, p53, Ki67, ssDNA, and clinicopathological parameters in four molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
Our previous studies in breast cancer cells indicate that 2CdA and F-ara-A are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription.
Similarly, TRIM22 protein is significantly down-regulated in breast tumors as compared to matched normal breast tissues.
