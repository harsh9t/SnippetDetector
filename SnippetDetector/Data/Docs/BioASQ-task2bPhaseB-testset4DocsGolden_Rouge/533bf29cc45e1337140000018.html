In certain human cancers, CD44v6 expression is associated with poor prognosis.
The expression of variant isoforms of CD44 correlates with the metastatic potential of various carcinomas.
BACKGROUND: The CD44 variant isoforms have been noted as markers for tumor metastasis and prognosis in several adenocarcinomas.
CD44 variant exon 3 is a heparan sulfate-binding isoform of CD44.
Recently, it was suggested that splice variants of the surface glycoprotein CD44 were associated with tumor metastasis in some cancers.
The proteoglycan CD44 is an adhesion molecule that may be expressed as a standard form of 85-95 KD or as several variant isoforms.
The large family of CD44 splice variants are likely to serve multiple functions in the embryo and in the adult organism.
Certain splice variants can promote the metastatic behavior of cancer cells.
Variants of CD44 differ from the standard form ( CD44s ) by usage of ten variant exons in various combinations.
CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein occurring in several isoforms with different extracellular regions.
The role of CD44v3 in invasion and metastasis associated with heparan sulfate in colon cancer cell lines and cases of colon cancer was examined.
The data were evaluated for any correlation with clinicopathological indices or prognosis.
