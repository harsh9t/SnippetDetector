The clinical use of oligonucleotide therapeutics has been hampered by their limited ability to penetrate intact cells.
The clinical use of these drugs has provided enormous tempo to clinical and pharmacological research.
In this review, we will discuss the current state of aptamers in clinical trials as well as some promising aptamers in pre-clinical development.
Aptamers specific for a number of cellular and viral proteins have been documented previously; one aptamer is approved for clinical use and several others are in clinical trials.
Aptamers are a special class of nucleic acid molecules that are beginning to be investigated for clinical use.
The first aptamer based therapeutic was FDA approved in 2004 for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and several other aptamers are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
Chemical manipulations of aptamers also allow for fine-tuning of their bioavailability, and antidote control greatly expands their clinical use.
In the last two decades, many aptamers have been clinically developed as inhibitors for targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor and thrombin.
In particular, the use of aptamers for the alleviation of blood clotting and the treatment of AIDS are considered.
Aspirin remains the first-line antiplatelet drug for clinical use.
