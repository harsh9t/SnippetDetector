Carcinogenesis or oncogenesis or tumorigenesis is literally the creation of cancer.
It is a process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells.
It is characterized by a progression of changes at the cellular, genetic and epigenetic level that ultimately reprogram a cell to undergo uncontrolled cell division, thus forming a malignant mass.
Carcinogenesis is caused by mutation and epimutation of the genetic material of normal cells, which upsets the normal balance between proliferation and cell death.
This results in uncontrolled cell division and the evolution of those cells by natural selection in the body.
The uncontrolled and often rapid proliferation of cells can lead to benign tumors; some types of these may turn into malignant tumors (cancer).
Based on studies, carcinogenesis also related with the defects in recombination repair.
