Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited cerebral small vessel disease, clinically characterized by migraine, recurrent transient ischemic attacks or strokes, psychiatric disorders and cognitive decline.
Strokes are typically ischemic, while hemorrhagic events have been only sporadically described.
CADASIL is the most common form of hereditary cerebral angiopathy.
