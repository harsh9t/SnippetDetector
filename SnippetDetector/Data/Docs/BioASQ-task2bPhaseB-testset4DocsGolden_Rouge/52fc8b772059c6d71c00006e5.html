Synthesis, modeling and structure-activity relationship of indazoles as inhibitors of Tpl2 kinase are described.
Tpl2 is an upstream kinase of MEK in the ERK pathway.
We have previously reported the discovery and initial SAR of the naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles and quinoline-3-carbonitriles as Tumor Progression Loci-2 ( Tpl2 ) kinase inhibitors.
Evaluation of hit chemotypes from high throughput screening identified a novel series of 2,4-disubstituted thieno pyridines as COT kinase inhibitors.
Tumour progression locus-2 is a serine/threonine kinase, which regulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor.
The QSAR model suggests that the inclusion of hydrophobic substituents will enhance the Tpl2 kinase inhibition.
The article describes the development of a robust pharmacophore model and the investigation of structure-activity relationship analysis of quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives reported for Tpl2 kinase inhibition.
The proposed binding mode suggests the potential flipped binding mode depending on the substitution.
Biacore studies show evidence of binding of these molecules to the protein kinase.
In this paper, we report new SAR efforts which have led to the identification of 4-alkylamino - naphthyridine-3-carbonitriles.
6 - triazol-4-ylmethyl ) - amino ) - quinoline-3-carbonitriles (4) are potent inhibitors of this enzyme.
Structural modifications exploring SAR at the 2 - and 4-positions resulting in inhibitors with improved enzyme potency and cellular activity are disclosed.
