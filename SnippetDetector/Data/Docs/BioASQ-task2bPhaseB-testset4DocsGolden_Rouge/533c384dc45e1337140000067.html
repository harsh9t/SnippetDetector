BACKGROUND: Incorporation of histone variants into chromatin is one of the epigenetic mechanisms used for regulation of gene expression.
We found that macroH2A1 was depleted on the transcribed regions of active genes.
We show that macroH2A1 histone variants are important for repressing the expression of endogenous murine leukemia viruses in mouse liver.
macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.
In contrast, MLV proviruses with a deletion in the 5 ' end of pro-pol were expressed in normal liver and showed relatively low levels of derepression in knockout liver.
Our findings indicate that differential incorporation of mH2A subtypes into the ribosome could regulate gene expression during the acclimatization process in carp.
Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A.
We studied the enrichment and distribution of the histone variant mH2A1 in the condensed inactive X chromosome.
Genes that escape X inactivation stand out as domains of macroH2A1 depletion.
In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome.
