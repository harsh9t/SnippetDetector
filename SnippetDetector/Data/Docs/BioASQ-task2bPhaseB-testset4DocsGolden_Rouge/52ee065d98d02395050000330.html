Machine learning technology is well suited for the induction of diagnostic and prognostic rules and solving of small and specialized diagnostic and prognostic problems.
The medical diagnostic knowledge can be automatically derived from the description of cases solved in the past.
In several medical domains we actually applied machine learning algorithms.
Typically, the automatically generated diagnostic rules achieved the same or slightly better diagnostic accuracy than physicians specialists.
There many several  application of machine learning algorithms in medical diagnosis such as Brain glioma progression, Microarray classification, Mass spectral proteomics, Lymph disease classification and Parkinson's disease.
