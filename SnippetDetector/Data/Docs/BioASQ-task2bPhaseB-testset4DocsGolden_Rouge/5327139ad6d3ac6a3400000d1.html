Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States and other parts of the world.
At present, the only widely accepted screening tools for PCa are prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination.
PSA is known to be prostate specific, but not PCa specific, and hence lacks the sensitivity to detect a large number of tumors, especially during the early stages.
(PMID: 24223021) Rapid uptake of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has occurred in the United States despite inconclusive evidence regarding mortality benefit (PMID: 15530599) PSA can be used reliably as a unique tool in the follow-up of patients for the early detection of progressive disease (PMID: 7544735).
