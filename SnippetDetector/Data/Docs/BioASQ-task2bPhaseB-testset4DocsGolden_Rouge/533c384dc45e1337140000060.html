macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.
The transcribed regions of most active genes are depleted of macroH2A, often in sharply localized domains that show depletion of 4-fold or more relative to bulk mouse liver chromatin.
This repressor activity of marcroH2A is further supported by the substantial and relatively uniform macroH2A1 enrichment along the inactive X chromosome, which averages 4-fold.
In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome.
