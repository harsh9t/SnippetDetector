Completion of genome sequences for many organisms allows a reasonably complete definition of the complement of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.
In mammals this  core matrisome  comprises β�Ό300 proteins.
we have developed a bioinformatic approach to predict the in silico  matrisome  defined as the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors.
