The treatment for hepatitis C virus infection has been significantly improved with the approval of the first two HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir ( Incivek ) and boceprevir ( Victrelis ).
the emergence of resistance to these two inhibitors reduced the effectiveness of vaniprevir and MK-5172 against viral replication.
We recently reported that the combination of two distinct classes of HCV inhibitors, entry inhibitors and replication inhibitors, prolonged reductions in extracellular HCV in persistently infected cells.
We investigated the ability of the SPT inhibitor NA808 to prevent HCV replication in cells and mice.
HCV NS5A replication complex inhibitors, exemplified by Daclatasvir, represent a new class of DAA.
We assessed the ability of NA808 or telaprevir to inhibit replication of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a in mice with humanized livers.
It might be developed for treatment of HCV infection or used in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a or HCV polymerase or protease inhibitors.
METHODS: We assessed boceprevir and telaprevir activity against an HCV G2 and G3 isolates enzyme panel, in replicon, and in phenotypic cell-based assays.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: To examine the antiviral activity of boceprevir, a hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor, in HCV genotype ( G ) 2/3-infected patients.
