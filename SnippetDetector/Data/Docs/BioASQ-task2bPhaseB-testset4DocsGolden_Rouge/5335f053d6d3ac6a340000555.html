mRNA stability plays a major role in regulating the temperature-specific expression of a Tetrahymena thermophila surface protein.
In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of the temperature-specific surface protein SerH3 is controlled primarily by a temperature-dependent change in the stability of its mRNA.
