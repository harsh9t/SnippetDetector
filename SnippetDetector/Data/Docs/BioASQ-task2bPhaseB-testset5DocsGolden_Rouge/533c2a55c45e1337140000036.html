Hippo-Lats-Yorkie signaling regulates tissue overgrowth and tumorigenesis in Drosophila.
We show that the Mst1 and Mst2 protein kinases, the mammalian Hippo orthologs, are cleaved and constitutively activated in the mouse liver.
The Hippo pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell proliferation and survival in Drosophila, which involves the negative regulation of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie by the kinases Hippo and Warts.
We find that EGFR activates the Hippo pathway transcription factor Yorkie and demonstrate that Yorkie is required for the influence of EGFR on cell proliferation in Drosophila.
The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood.
A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.
The serine/threonine protein kinases Mst1 and Mst2, mammalian homologs of the Hippo kinase from Drosophila, play the central roles in the Hippo pathway controlling the cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during development.
Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis.
The Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as a critical regulator for organ size control.
