In bladder cancer, hepaCAM (hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule), RARΞ²(2), APC, TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain), RASSF1A, p14(ARF) and p16 genes were found to be methylated.
These methylation events were demostrated to associate with downregulation of gene expression.
