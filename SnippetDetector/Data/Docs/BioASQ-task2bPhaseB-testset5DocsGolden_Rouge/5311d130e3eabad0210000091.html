Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be facilitated by cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in combination with imaging and clinical assessments.
By determining the concentration of beta amyloid fragments, total tau (t-tau) and phospho-tau (p-tau), it is possible to detect the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD or distinguish AD vs.
pseudo-dementia.
However, these markers are poorly sensitive to the progressive disease stages.
