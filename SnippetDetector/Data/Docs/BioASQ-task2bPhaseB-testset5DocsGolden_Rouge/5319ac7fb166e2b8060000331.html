Podosomes and invadopodia are actin-based structures at the ventral cell membrane, which have a role in cell adhesion, migration and invasion.
Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that FHOD1 contributes to cell migration and invasion.
Finally, FHOD1 depletion reduced the ability of EMT cancer cells to form invadopodia and to degrade extracellular matrix.
Our results indicate that FHOD1 participates in cytoskeletal changes in EMT.
In conclusion, EMT affects the invasion machinery of oral squamous carcinoma cells.
Non-invasive squamous carcinoma cells constitutively organize podosomes, whereas invasive cells form invadopodia.
The club-ended cell extensions, or externalized invadopodia, are involved in ECM degradation and maintenance of contact to adhesion substrate and surrounding cells during invasion.
