GF-Ξ²-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition  We can show that (1) IGF-II induces a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition;  The EMT process is mediated via exposure to vitreous cytokines and growth factors such as TGF-Ξ²2.
SHh regulation by CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active Notch-1.
IGF-II induces rapid beta-catenin relocation to the nucleus during epithelium to mesenchyme transition  Our recent studies found that CCN1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of EMT and stemness.
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is an oncoprotein that is involved in tumorigenesis, and PD173074 is known to be a selective inhibitor of FGFR1.
loss of Na,K-ATPase Ξ²1 is a potential contributor to TGF-Ξ²2-mediated EMT in RPE cells.
Furthermore, treatment of HOC313 cells with PD173074 suppressed cellular proliferation and invasion and reduced ERK1/2 and p38 activation.
nflammatory cytokines augments TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cells by up-regulating TbetaR-I.
