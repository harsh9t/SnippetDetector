Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which is fundamental for neuronal development and specification.
In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates.
This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory.
In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury.
