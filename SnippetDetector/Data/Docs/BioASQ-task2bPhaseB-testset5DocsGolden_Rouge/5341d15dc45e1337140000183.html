non-apoptotic programmed cell death, such as autophagy   utophagy is a ubiquitous eukaryotic cytoplasmic quality and quantity control pathway  definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled  autophagy, a process in which de novo formed membrane enclosed vesicles engulf and consume cellular components  utophagy has been predominantly studied as a nonselective self-digestion process that recycles macromolecules and produces energy in response to starvation  utophagy is a catabolic trafficking pathway for bulk destruction and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles via regulated lysosomal degradation.
Autophagic PCD in animals is defined as being accompanied by an increase in the number of autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and small lytic vacuoles produced by autolysosomes  utophagy is the endogenous, tightly regulated cellular  housekeeping  process responsible for the degradation of damaged and dysfunctional cellular organelles and protein aggregates.
