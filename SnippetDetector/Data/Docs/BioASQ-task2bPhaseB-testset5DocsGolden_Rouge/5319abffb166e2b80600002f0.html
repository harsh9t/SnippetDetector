EMT is characterized by acquisition of cell motility, modifications of cell morphology, and cell dissociation correlating with the loss of desmosomes from the cellular cortex.
A number of growth factors have been shown to be involved in this process.
These include fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), TGF-Ξ²1, TGF-Ξ²2, TNF-Ξ±, CCN family, Sonic Hedgehog (SHh), Notch1, GF-Ξ², Wnt, EGF, bFGF, IGF-I and IGF-II.
