EphA1/EphA8 was down-regulated in glioblastomas  EphB4 and EphrinB2 protein expression in astrocytomas  phrin-A1 is a negative regulator in glioma  phrinA5 acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma  phrinA1 is released in three forms from cancer cells  EPHB6, EFNB2, and EFNB3 expressions in human neuroblastoma.
EphA2 receptor and ephrinA1 ligand in solid tumors  phA2 as a novel molecular marker and target in glioblastoma multiforme  overexpression of EphB2 in glioma cells increases cell invasion  gliomas display over-expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2.
