To better understand the cellular mechanism of radioprotection of osseous tissue, the authors sought to determine the effect of dose fractionation and amifostine on isolated osteoblasts.
Novel schedules and routes of administration are under investigation, and may further simplify the use of amifostine and considerably broaden its applications.
The cytoprotective mechanism of amifostine is complicated, involving free radical scavenging, DNA protection and repair acceleration, and induction of cellular hypoxia.
This review summarizes the preclinical data and clinical experience with amifostine, and provides insight into future clinical directions.
Incubation of cell lines with amifostine resulted in HIF1 alpha induction.
The hypovascularity and acidity of the tumor environment and the differential expression of alkaline phosphatase in normal and neoplastic tissues contribute to its cytoprotective selectivity.
An inactive prodrug, amifostine is converted to an active thiol by dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase in the normal endothelium.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatic and biliary toxicity are still significant problems after intraarterial hepatic chemoembolization for liver metastases from large bowel cancers.
PURPOSE: Tumor hypoxia and low intrinsic radiosensitivity may counteract the efficacy of standard radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer.
We investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy.
