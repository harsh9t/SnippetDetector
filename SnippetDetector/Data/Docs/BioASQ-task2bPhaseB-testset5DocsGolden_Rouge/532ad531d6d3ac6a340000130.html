The variable domains of heavy and light chains of antibodies consist of two Ξ²-sheets.
The first one is composed of four strands, A, B, E and D, and the second one is composed of six strands, named A', G, F, C, C' and C''.
The antigen binding site is formed by the inter-strand links BC, Cβ€²Cβ€³ and FG from each domain.
