Efficient cellular fractionation improves RNA sequencing analysis of mature and nascent transcripts from human tissues.
Here we show that RNA-seq can also be used for studying nascent RNAs undergoing transcription.
We utilize nascent RNA sequencing to document dosage compensation during transcriptional elongation.
