because some archaeal genomes contain multiple origins of replication, bias in gene dosage caused by delayed replication should be minimized and hence the substitution rate of genes should associate less with chromosome position.
Chromosomes with multiple DNA replication origins are a hallmark of Eukaryotes and some Archaea.
Archaea seem to replicate using a single origin even though archaeal replication factors are more like those of eukaryotes.
We employed Z-curve analysis to identify one replication origin in the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii genome, two replication origins in the Halobacterium species NRC-1 genome and one replication origin in the Methanosarcina mazei genome.
To test this hypothesis, six archaeal genomes from the genus Sulfolobus containing three origins of replication were selected, conserved orthologs were identified, and the evolutionary rates of these orthologs were quantified.
Genome-wide measures of DNA strand composition have been used to find archaeal DNA replication origins.
We show that core gene distribution provides a useful tool for origin identification in archaea, and predict multiple replication origins in a range of species.
CONCLUSION: This study provides detailed information about the diversity of multiple orc/cdc6-associated replication origins in haloarchaeal genomes, and provides novel insight into the evolution of multiple replication origins in Archaea.
