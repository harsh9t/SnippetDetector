Dysregulation of cell adhesion and motility is known to be an important factor in the development of tumor malignancy.
Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion.
Actopaxin phosphorylation is elevated in the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compared with normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells.
Here, phosphorylation of actopaxin is shown to contribute to the regulation of matrix degradation and cell invasion.
We report that Binder of Arl Two plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells.
Epidermal growth factor may increase cell motility, an event implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of CTXG on the proliferation, migration and invasion of SW620 cells.
Dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 were stably expressed in the most metastatic cell variant.
We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis.
Tumor invasion and metastasis is directly related to cell motility.
These results indicate that overexpression of Rho proteins contributes to cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
