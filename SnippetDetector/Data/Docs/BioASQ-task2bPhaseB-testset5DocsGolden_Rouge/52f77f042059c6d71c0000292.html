Most cases of tuberous sclerosis complex are complicated with bilateral multiple renal angiomyolipoma.
Hepatic angiomyolipomas (AML), cysts, and other benign lesions were identified in 30% of the cohort, and some lesions grew significantly over time.
Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis and bilateral renal angiomyolipomas are some presentations of tuberous sclerosis and the coexistence of both conditions may cause devastating morbidity and mortality.
Periodic imaging surveillance for development of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), preferably by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 1-3Β years, is now standard of care   Although large tubers are less common than small to medium-sized ones, they are much more likely to be accompanied by severe clinical symptoms (seizures, mental retardation and autistic behaviour), even when the smaller tubers are quite numerous.
