Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement.
We found that fibroblasts from EDG-1 null embryos did not migrate toward PDGF or SPP, and inhibition of motility correlated with defective activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is required for lamellipodia formation and directional locomotion.
