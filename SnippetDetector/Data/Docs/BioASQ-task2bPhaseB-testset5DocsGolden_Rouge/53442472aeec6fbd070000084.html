linked ligand for the EphA2 receptor, which is overexpressed in glioblastoma, among other cancers.
In this study, we showed that the expression of ephrinA5 was dramatically downregulated in primary gliomas compared with normal tissues.
Eph receptors, the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, and their ephrin ligands play important roles in nervous system development.
We investigated the presence of EphA2, and its ligand, ephrinA1, in glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant neoplasm of glial cells, and normal brain.
A functional role for EphA2 was investigated by assessing the activation status of the receptor and the effect of ephrinA1 on the anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness of GBM cells.
OBJECTIVE: The ligand EphrinB2 and the corresponding receptor EphB4 are up-regulated and involved in tumor growth in various human cancers.
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ephrin-B2 localization primarily in GBM cells but not in normal brain.
Here, expression profiles of ephrin-B family members were determined in four glioma cell lines and in invading glioblastoma cells collected by laser capture microdissection.
Previously, we showed that overexpression of EphB2 in glioma cells increases cell invasion.
Forced expression of ephrin-B3 in low expressor cell lines stimulated cell migration and invasion in vitro and ex vivo, concomitant with tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B3.
