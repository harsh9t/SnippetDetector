We interpret the multiple conformations of NS5 observed in solution as resulting from weak interactions between the two NS5 domains and flexibility of the linker in the absence of other components of the replication complex.
Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp.
The West Nile virus NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase ( MTase ) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp ) domain essential for virus replication.
Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the non-structural protein 5 ( NS5 ) is a key activity for viral RNA replication.
The structure completes the vision for polymerase motifs F and G, and depicts defined intra-molecular interactions between RdRP and MTase.
Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.
The flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase in its N-terminal 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRP ) within the C-terminal part.
