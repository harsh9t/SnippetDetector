high expression of ephrin-B2 is a strong predictor of short-term survival and that ephrin-B2 plays a critical role in glioma invasion rendering this signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target  deregulation of Eph/ephrin expression in medulloblastoma enhances the invasive phenotype, suggesting a potential role in local tumor cell invasion and the formation of metastases  migrating glioblastoma cells overexpress EphB2 in vitro and in vivo; glioma migration and invasion are promoted by activation of EphB2 or inhibited by blocking EphB2.
Dysregulation of EphB2 expression or function may underlie glioma invasion  gene expression of Eph receptors and ephrins in benign human tissues and cancers  phosphorylation of ephrin-B2 ligand promotes glioma cell migration and invasion  phB2 activity plays a pivotal role in pediatric medulloblastoma cell adhesion and invasion  crosstalk between Eph and integrin signalling pathways at the membrane protrusions and in the migration of brain cancer cells.
