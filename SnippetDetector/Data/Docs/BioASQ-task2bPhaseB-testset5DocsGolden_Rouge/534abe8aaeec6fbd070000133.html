Conversely, inhibition of HSP90 significantly increased the expression of both VEGF and HGF mRNA, and induced HSP70 protein in PHH cultures in vitro.
HSP90 inhibition was associated with decreased neuroendocrine ErbB and IGF-I receptor expression, decreased Erk and Akt phospho-rylation and the induction of HSP70 expression.
