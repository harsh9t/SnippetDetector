Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) DNA editing technology enables site-directed engineering of the genome  Tal-effector nucleases (TALENs) are engineered proteins that can stimulate precise genome editing through specific DNA double-strand breaks  We used this opportunity to evaluate the effect of total donor homology on transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) mediated bi-allelic modification.
Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free Ξ²-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ.
