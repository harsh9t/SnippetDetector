BACKGROUND: Amifostine was developed to protect normal tissues from radiation exposure.
This is the first report focusing on amifostine related adverse effects leading to discontinuation of amifostine treatment.
We have previously shown that amifostine protects both chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane vessels and cells from the effects of X-rays.
There are currently no effective approaches to protect people from benzene-induced hematotoxicity and AA.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amifostine has been shown to protect against xerostomia induced by radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, but its impact on the therapeutic index is unknown.
Whereas evidence suggests that sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate and amifostine protect renal cells against CAA toxicity in vitro, their efficacy in clinical studies is controversial.
the protective mechanism of amifostine influence on healthy cells has not been fully comprehended, and the research is still being carried out.
Amifostine is one of the few drugs with protective abilities in regard to healthy tissues during antineoplastic therapy.
Antineoplastic drugs and/or their metabolites are very reactive chemically and easily react with cell components, both those neoplastic and healthy, which leads to uncontrolled cell damage.
Recently, a number of agents have been developed to protect normal tissue from the harmful effects of antitumor therapies.
