Most histone modifications can easily be characterized as either activating or repressive.
Post-translational modification of histone tails is thought to modulate higher-order chromatin structure.
This result indicates that H3K36me3 is associated with both facultative and constitutive heterochromatin.
In eukaryotes, histone methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with a variety of functions related to gene regulation or genomic stability.
Posttranslational histone modifications and histone variants form a unique epigenetic landscape on mammalian chromosomes where the principal epigenetic heterochromatin markers, trimethylated histone H3 and the histone H2A.
The degree of individual histone modifications may vary between specific chromatin domains and throughout the cell cycle.
H3 lysine 9 trimethylation is a histone posttranslational modification ( PTM ) that has emerged as hallmark of pericentromeric heterochromatin.
We report the distribution of several histone modifications along the arms and in centromeric regions of somatic chromosomes of maize, including the supernumerary B chromosome.
We have analyzed the pattern of histone modifications associated with facultative heterochromatin within the mouse imprinted Snurf-Snrpn cluster, which is homologous to the human Prader-Willi syndrome genomic region.
We have studied the nuclear patterns of histone H3 and H4 acetylation and of H3 methylation in Arabidopsis.
Z, are inversely localized in relation to each other.
