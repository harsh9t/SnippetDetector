The bundling activity of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein is required for filopodium formation  In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo.
CRP1, a protein localized in filopodia of growth cones, is involved in dendritic growth  Fascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia (ribs) and filopodia.
These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family.
Consistently, Cdc42-induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8.
Overexpression of CRP1 increases filopodia formation and neurite branching, which require its actin-bundling activity.
Role of the actin bundling protein fascin in growth cone morphogenesis: localization in filopodia and lamellipodia  Here, we report that CRP1 colocalizes with actin in the filopodia of growth cones in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.
Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that induces membrane protrusions and cell motility after the formation of lamellipodia or filopodia.
