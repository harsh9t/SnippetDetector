UNLABELLED: The metabolic syndrome is characterized by a cluster of risk factors including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, The MetS is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ).
The aim of the study was to identify risk factors of Charcot neuroarthropathy occurrence in patients with diabetic foot and type 2 diabetes.
UNLABELLED: We investigated the association between circulating levels of 60 and 70 kDa heat-shock proteins and cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women with or without metabolic syndrome ( MetS ).
Insulin resistance has a key role in metabolic changes in these children.
The pattern of appearance of dyslipidemia also varies in children with risk factors even in the pre-pubertal group from those without risk.
In this study, we aim to examine the associations of obesity related loci with risk of metabolic syndrome in a children population from China.
UNLABELLED: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance, is dramatically increasing in Western and developing countries.
Recently, the International Diabetes Federation has proposed a new set of criteria to define metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents aged 6-16 years.
