flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase (MTase) in its N-terminal β‰� 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) within the C-terminal part.
One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation.
Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.
