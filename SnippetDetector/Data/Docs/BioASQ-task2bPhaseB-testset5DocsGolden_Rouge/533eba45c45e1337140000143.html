Both dose fractionation and amifostine protect osteoblasts from the growth inhibitory effects of ionizing radiation.
Fractionation but not amifostine was protective for hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor production (used as a surrogate marker of normal osteoblast function)  Amifostine (Ethyol) is a prodrug that must be dephosphorylated to the free thiol in which form it can detoxify free oxygen radicals generated by radiation, hypoxia and by drugs such anthracyclines, platinum analogues and alkylating agents.
Amifostine as inactive prodrug is primarily metabolized at the tissue site by membrane alkaline phosphatase, which is highly active in the cell membranes of normal endothelial cells and biliary tree cells but not in the cell membranes and neovascular capillaries of tumor.
