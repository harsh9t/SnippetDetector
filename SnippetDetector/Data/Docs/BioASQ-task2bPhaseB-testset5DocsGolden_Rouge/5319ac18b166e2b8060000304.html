Their activity is controlled by the guanine exchange factor RhoGEF2, which is planar polarized and absent in non-intercalating regions.
We delineate a pathway that controls the initiation of E-cadherin endocytosis through the regulation of AP2 and clathrin coat recruitment by E-cadherin.
Collectively, SMAP1 likely represents a key Arf6GAP in clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin in MDCK cells.
E-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junction in epithelial cells and continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae depending on the cell type.
In this study, we examined the role of SMAP1, a clathrin-interacting GTPase-activating protein for the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) GTPase, in E-cadherin endocytosis.
A dileucine motif in the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain is required for E-cadherin endocytosis, because substitution of these residues to alanine resulted in impaired internalization of the protein.
Consistent with these observations, we found that selective uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin by introduction of amino acid substitutions in the p120-binding site increased the level of E-cadherin endocytosis.
Further, p120 knockdown by small interference RNA resulted in dose-dependent elimination of cell surface E-cadherin.
Nevertheless, in a high percentage of gastric carcinoma cases displaying E-cadherin dysfunction, the mechanism responsible for E-cadherin dysregulation is unknown.
