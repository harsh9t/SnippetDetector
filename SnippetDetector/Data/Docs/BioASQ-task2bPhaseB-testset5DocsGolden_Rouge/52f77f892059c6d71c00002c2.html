In addition, IQSCMaRTEA may be helpful for testing inhibitors of nonsense-mediated decay, as stop codon management therapy will sometimes require inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay and translational bypass of the nonsense mutation.
These data demonstrate the utility of IQSCMaRTEA for evaluating drugs that bypass nonsense mutations.
Stop codons are used to signal the ribosome to terminate the decoding of an mRNA template.
Unproductive bypassing may result from premature dissociation of peptidyl-tRNAs from ribosomes or resumption of translation at inappropriate sites.
Ribosomes translating bacteriophage T4 gene 60 mRNA bypass 50 noncoding nucleotides from a takeoff site at codon 46 to a landing site just upstream of codon 47.
In light of the alternatives, we investigated the sequences flanking the leaky UAG codon using an in vivo assay in which bypass of the stop codon is coupled to the transient expression of beta-glucuronidase reporter genes in tobacco protoplasts.
Expression of retroviral replication enzymes requires a controlled translational recoding event to bypass the stop codon at the end of gag.
The results suggest that the efficiency of readthrough is determined by the sequence surrounding the stop codon.
Plant RNA viruses commonly exploit leaky translation termination signals in order to express internal protein coding regions.
