In Europe, many flaviviruses are endemic or occasionally imported ( dengue, yellow fever viruses ).
One of NITD's missions is to develop antivirals for dengue virus, the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral pathogen.
For the last 60 years, only a few cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been detected in Bulgaria.
TBE virus RNA was detected in serum and milk of the source goat.
Moreover, in recent years the Flavivirus genus has gained further attention due to re-emergence and increasing incidence of West Nile, dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses.
Tick-borne encephalitis is a substantial public health problem in many parts of Europe and Asia.
The sequences of the protease domain of the tick-borne encephalitis virus NS3 protein have two amino acid substitutions, 16 R ' K and 45 S ' F, in the highly pathogenic and poorly pathogenic strains of the virus, respectively.
Langat virus was used for the establishment of an in vitro model of tick-borne encephalitis.
Tick-borne encephalitis virus belongs to the family of flaviviruses and is transmitted by infected ticks.
RT-LAMP assay for Sib and for Eu specifically amplified viral genes of IR-99 and Hochosterwitz strains, respectively.
BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis virus is a causative agent of acute central nervous system disease in humans.
