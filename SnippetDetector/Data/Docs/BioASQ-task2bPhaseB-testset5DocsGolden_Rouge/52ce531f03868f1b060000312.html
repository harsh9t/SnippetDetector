ECs are therefore difficult to genetically manipulate ex vivo for functional studies or gene therapy.
We assessed lentiviral vectors targeted to the EC surface marker CD105 for in vivo gene delivery.
BACKGROUND: Double-suicide gene therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced cancer.
As a monogenic disease affecting the hematopoietic system, CGD is amenable to gene therapy.
It has become an important research line in the development of gene therapy to overcome the drawbacks of single-gene therapy.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an inherited immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene encoding WASP, a protein regulating the cytoskeleton.
This review addresses the current status of gene therapy for immunodeficiencies, chronic granulomatous disease, suicide gene therapy for graft-versus-host disease, viral infections, malignant hematologic disorders, hemophilia, and the hemoglobin disorders.
The data demonstrate for the first time targeted gene delivery to specialized ECs upon systemic vector administration.
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell transplants can be curative, but, when matched donors are unavailable, infusion of autologous HSPCs modified ex vivo by gene therapy is an alternative approach.
METHODS: gef and apoptin genes were cloned into a doxycycline-regulated retrovirus-mediated gene expression system.
Different types of endothelial cells fulfill distinct tasks depending on their microenvironment.
