An efficient shotgun lipidomics strategy was established and optimized for fast phospholipid profiling of viscera from three fish species: Lateolabrax japonicas, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, and Carassius auratus.
This strategy relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a tandem mass spectrometer without additional separation of the individual molecular species.
