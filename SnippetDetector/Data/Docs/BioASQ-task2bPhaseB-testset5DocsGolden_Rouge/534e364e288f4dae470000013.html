In the fission yeast genome DSBs are located within 194 prominent peaks separated on average by 65-kbp intervals of DNA that are largely free of DSBs  meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) which occur at relatively high frequencies in some genomic regions (hotspots) and relatively low frequencies in others (coldspots).
