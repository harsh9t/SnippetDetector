The composition of urine is influenced by diet and changes in dietary factors have been proposed to modify the risk of recurrent nephrolithiasis.
There is significant evidence showing that a high calcium diet is associated with a reduction of lithogenic risk.
Observational studies have shown a positive and independent association between sodium intake and the formation of new kidney stones.
Among them, 710 participants reported a history of kidney stones.
Hypercalciuria is recognized as a major risk factor for kidney stone formation.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent recurrent kidney stones.
Evidence is also accumulating of the protective effect of adequate dietary potassium on age-related bone loss and reduction of kidney stones.
AIMS: We aimed to determine whether there is an association between dietary zinc intake and prevalent kidney stone disease defined as self-report of any previous episode of kidney stone.
In conclusion, diet is a key element in the management of the patient with kidney stones but always subordinated to present metabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that higher DZI is associated with increased risk of kidney stone disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequential therapy reduced hypercalciuria and the incidence of associated diseases.
