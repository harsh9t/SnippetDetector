There is significant evidence showing that a high calcium diet is associated with a reduction of lithogenic risk.
Cadmium exposure is associated with increased urinary calcium excretion.
In prospective observational studies, diets rich in magnesium were associated with a lower risk of kidney stone formation in men.
CONCLUSION: Stone composition in Australia has remained relatively static over the past 30 years.
Modifications in diet and body habitus have not resulted in significant changes in the proportion of uric acid and calcium oxalate stones detected.
We examined associations between dietary calcium from nondairy and dairy sources, and symptomatic nephrolithiasis.
AIMS: We aimed to determine whether there is an association between dietary zinc intake and prevalent kidney stone disease defined as self-report of any previous episode of kidney stone.
Among them, 710 participants reported a history of kidney stones.
DATA SYNTHESIS: In patients with 1 past calcium stone, low-strength evidence showed that increased fluid intake halved recurrent composite stone risk compared with no treatment, 0.
45 ( 95 % CI, 0.
24 to 0.
84 ) ).
Properly dosed thiazide treatment is the standard therapy for calcium stone formers with idiopathic hypercalciuria.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent recurrent kidney stones.
