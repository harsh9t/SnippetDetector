We performed a case-controlled validation study in which voided urines from 127 patients were analyzed.
Through extensive genomic and proteomic profiling of urine components we previously identified a panel of 8 biomarkers that can facilitate the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples.
PURPOSE: Accurate urine assays for bladder cancer detection would benefit patients and health care systems.
The urinary concentration of 8 biomarkers was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
We have comprehensively summarized the performance of several biomarkers in the diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer.
We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic potential of HA family members in BCa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR assay was used to detect promoter hypermethylation in 4 genes ( E-cadherin, p16, p14, and RASSF1A ) to identify reliable biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis in primary tumor DNA and urine sediment DNA from 57 bladder cancer patients.
BACKGROUND: Urinary biomarkers for bladder cancer detection are constrained by inadequate sensitivity or specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of E-cadherin, p14 or RASSF1A in urine sediment DNA is a potential biomarker for detecting superficial, low grade cancer.
We evaluated whether alterations in miRNA expression could improve disease stratification and outcome prognosis in bladder tumors and noninvasive diagnosis in urinary samples.
