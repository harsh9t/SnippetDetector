Slug mRNA was shown to be over-expressed in adenocarcinoma and inversely correlated to E-cadherin expression.
We showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression.
nteraction with Suv39H1 is critical for Snail-mediated E-cadherin repression in breast cancer  eltaEF1 is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and regulates epithelial plasticity in breast cancer cells  Ectopic expression of deltaEF1 in epithelial cells was sufficient to downregulate E-cadherin and to induce EMT.
Overexpression of Slug in OE33 mediated E-cadherin repression and induced the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin.
Silencing of the expression of both SIP1 and deltaEF1, but not either alone, completely abolished TGF-beta-induced E-cadherin repression.
9a interacts with Snail and is critical for Snail-mediated E-cadherin repression in human breast cancer  E-cadherin repression mediated by E2-2 is indirect and independent of proximal E-boxes of the promoter.
