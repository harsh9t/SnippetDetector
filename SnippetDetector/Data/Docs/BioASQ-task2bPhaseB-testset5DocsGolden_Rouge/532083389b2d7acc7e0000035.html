Tick-borne encephalitis virus is the causative agent of tick-borne encephalitis, a potentially fatal neurological infection.
Langat virus was used for the establishment of an in vitro model of tick-borne encephalitis.
Tick-borne encephalitis is a substantial public health problem in many parts of Europe and Asia.
For the last 60 years, only a few cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been detected in Bulgaria.
Tick-borne encephalitis virus belongs to the family of flaviviruses and is transmitted by infected ticks.
In Europe, many flaviviruses are endemic or occasionally imported ( dengue, yellow fever viruses ).
In order to obtain a better understanding of tick-borne encephalitis virus strain movements in central Europe the E gene sequences of 102 TBEV strains collected from 1953 to 2011 at 38 sites in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria and Germany were determined.
A method for rapid production of single-round infectious particles of flavivirus would be useful for viral mutagenesis studies.
Due to the global threat of viral pandemics, there is an urgent need for new drugs.
One of NITD's missions is to develop antivirals for dengue virus, the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral pathogen.
In addition, these results emphasize the need for further epidemiological research of TBEV.
