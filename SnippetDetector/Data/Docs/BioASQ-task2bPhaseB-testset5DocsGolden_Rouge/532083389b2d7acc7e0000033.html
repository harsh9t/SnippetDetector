In this study, we demonstrated that TBEV-infected ticks have been distributed in the ROK, combined with our previous results.
These results suggest that TBEV may exist in the ROK, and H.
longicornis, H.
flava, and I.
nipponensis may be potential vectors of TBEV   tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) have been detected in Bulgaria.
Considering the remarkable increase in TBE morbidity in Europe over the past two decades, we conducted a study of TBE among patients with acute viral meningitis who were hospitalised in Bulgaria during 2009 to 2012.
