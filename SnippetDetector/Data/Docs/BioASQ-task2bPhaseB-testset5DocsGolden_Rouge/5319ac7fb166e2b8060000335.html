Metastasis is a major cause of mortality in cancer patients.
Here, we report that Twist1 is capable of promoting the formation of invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions for extracellular matrix degradation.
Podosomes and invadopodia are actin-based structures at the ventral cell membrane, which have a role in cell adhesion, migration and invasion.
Twist, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is involved in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, which play an essential role in cancer metastasis.
stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition is an important developmental process that has also been implicated in increased cell invasion and metastatic potential of cancer cells.
Little is known about the differences and dynamics underlying these structures.
We studied podosome-like structures of oral squamous carcinoma cells and invadopodia of their invasive variant that has undergone a spontaneous epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
We show that Twist1 and PDGFR are central mediators of invadopodia formation in response to various EMT-inducing signals.
Recently, invadopodia have been increasingly recognized as important drivers of local invasion in metastasis.
Finally, FHOD1 depletion reduced the ability of EMT cancer cells to form invadopodia and to degrade extracellular matrix.
The Twist1 transcription factor is known to promote tumor metastasis and induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.
