(18)F-flutemetamol PET and structural MRI provided additive information in the diagnostic classification of aMCI subjects, suggesting an amyloid-independent neurodegenerative component among aMCI subjects in this sample.
This pooled analysis of four studies determined the level of association between uptake of the fibrillar amyloid Ξ² positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [(18)F]flutemetamol (Pittsburgh Compound B analog with a 5.
5 times longer half-life to enable it to be used in the clinical setting)   Criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) propose Ξ²-amyloid (AΞ²) plaques to initiate neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions.
However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent AΞ² burden.
Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that AΞ²-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns.
