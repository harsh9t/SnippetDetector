Sj gren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which immune cells chronically attack the lachrymal and salivary glands.
The purpose of this qualitative research was to explore the lived experiences of women with Sjogren's Syndrome, a chronic autoimmune syndrome in which invading lymphocytes attack moisture-producing glands of the body.
Exocrine glands are the primary target and their functional impairment comes as a result of immune attack of epithelial cells of the affected organs.
NOD mice manifest many features of autoimmune exocrinopathy, a disease generally characterized by a chronic, progressive immunological attack against the exocrine tissues of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
By definition, the disease must be mediated by specific immune reactions against endogenous tissues to qualify as an autoimmune disease.
In addition, produce cytokines and chemokines that recruit lymphocytes in the immunopathogenic lesion.
Although, we previously established a good correlation between SjS in humans and autoimmune exocrinopathy in NOD/LtJ mice an in-depth evaluation of lacrimal gland disease in the NOD/LtJ mouse has remained limited.
Igmu, defined an important role for B lymphocytes in the development of xerostomia, implicating autoantibodies reactive with the acetylcholine muscarinic receptor ( M3R ) as the possible effector mechanism.
