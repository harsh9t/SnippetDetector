Doxorubicin induces apoptosis in germ line stem cells in the immature rat testis and amifostine cannot protect against this cytotoxicity.
Amifostine alone is inactive chemically, but active metabolite amifostine WR-1065 has been assumed to protect the healthy tissues during antineoplastic therapy by bounding of anticancer drug, causing their detoxification and/or eliminating the free radicals generated during radiation and cytostatic therapy  Amifostine protects bone marrow from benzene-induced hematotoxicity in mice.
(AMF) has been shown to protect some normal tissues from acute effects of radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy  Amifostine has shown to selectively protect normal tissues against cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of several anti-neoplastic drugs, such as alkylating agents, organoplatinum compounds, anthracyclines, taxanes, and ionising radiati  Amifostine has been shown to protect against xerostomia induced by radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, but its impact on the therapeutic index is unknown.
This is the first report focusing on amifostine related adverse effects leading to discontinuation of amifostine treatment.
