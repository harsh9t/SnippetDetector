BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells.
Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion.
Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness.
Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1.
