There are several ways to classify the different types of autophagy.
Apoptosis is a physiological method of cell death commonly referred to as programmed cell death.
There is a growing consensus that autophagy is upregulated in the setting of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.
Not surprisingly, the death of a cell is a complex and well controlled process.
The current working definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled.
Autophagy is the endogenous, tightly regulated cellular ``housekeeping '' process responsible for the degradation of damaged and dysfunctional cellular organelles and protein aggregates.
Autophagy is a catabolic trafficking pathway for bulk destruction and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles via regulated lysosomal degradation.
It is nonetheless suggested here that tonoplast rupture and the subsequent rapid destruction of the cytoplasm can distinguish two large PCD classes.
In eukaryotic cells, autophagy occurs constitutively at low levels to perform housekeeping functions, such as the destruction of dysfunctional organelles.
Autophagy is a ubiquitous eukaryotic cytoplasmic quality and quantity control pathway.
apoptosis does not function alone in determining the fate of a cell.
Remarkably, HDAC6 and cortactin are dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy.
