We assessed lentiviral vectors targeted to the EC surface marker CD105 for in vivo gene delivery.
The mouse CD105-specific vector, mCD105-LV, transduced only CD105-positive cells in primary liver cell cultures.
ECs are therefore difficult to genetically manipulate ex vivo for functional studies or gene therapy.
In a trial for hemophilia B, long-term expression of human FIX has been observed following adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene transfer into the liver.
This review addresses the current status of gene therapy for immunodeficiencies, chronic granulomatous disease, suicide gene therapy for graft-versus-host disease, viral infections, malignant hematologic disorders, hemophilia, and the hemoglobin disorders.
We used a lentiviral vector to transfer a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells from three presymptomatic patients who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an inherited immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene encoding WASP, a protein regulating the cytoskeleton.
CONCLUSIONS: Double-suicide gene therapy based on gef and apoptin genes may be a candidate for the development of new colon cancer strategies, and further studies are warranted to establish the usefulness of double-suicide gene therapy in vivo.
BACKGROUND: Double-suicide gene therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced cancer.
