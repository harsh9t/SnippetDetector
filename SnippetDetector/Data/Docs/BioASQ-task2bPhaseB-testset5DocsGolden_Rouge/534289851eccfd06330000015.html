Amifostine has shown to selectively protect normal tissues against cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of several anti-neoplastic drugs, such as alkylating agents, organoplatinum compounds, anthracyclines, taxanes, and ionising radiati.
Amifostine alone is inactive chemically, but active metabolite amifostine WR-1065 has been assumed to protect the healthy tissues during antineoplastic therapy by bounding of anticancer drug, causing their detoxification and/or eliminating the free radicals generated during radiation and cytostatic therapy  CYP), a commonly prescribed chemotherapy drug, has multiple adverse side effects including alteration of taste.
The effects on taste are a cause of concern for patients as changes in taste are often associated with loss of appetite, malnutrition, poor recovery and reduced quality of life.
Amifostine is a cytoprotective agent that was previously shown to be effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced mucositis and nephrotoxicity.
(AMF) has been shown to protect some normal tissues from acute effects of radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy.
