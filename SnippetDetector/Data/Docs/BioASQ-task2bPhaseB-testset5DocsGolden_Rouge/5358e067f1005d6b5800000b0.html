A number of proteins have been found to regulate F-actin bundling and enhance filopodia formation and motility.
Among these are Cysteine-rich protein 1 (CRP1), Fascin, Macrophage actin-associated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (MAYP/PSTPIP2), Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53), Missing in metastasis protein (MIM), Eps8, Diaphanous-related formin (dDia2) and Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP).
