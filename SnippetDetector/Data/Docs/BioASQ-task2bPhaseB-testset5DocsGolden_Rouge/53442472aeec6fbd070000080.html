Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are involved in the development of the central nervous system.
Their expression is often reported to be up-regulated in brain tumours and they may be considered molecular markers for the diagnosis of invasive and metastatic tumours.
However, there are also reports describing the down-regulation of the Eph/ephrin family in brain cancer.
