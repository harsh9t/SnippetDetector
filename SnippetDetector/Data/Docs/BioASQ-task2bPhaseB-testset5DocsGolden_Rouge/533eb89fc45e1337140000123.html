RESULTS: HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha were expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cancer cells, while CA9 had a membrane reactivity.
A high expression of HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9 was noted in 21/39, 20/39 ( 51.
3 % ) and 23/39 ( 58.
9 % ) cases, respectively.
PURPOSE: Tumor hypoxia and low intrinsic radiosensitivity may counteract the efficacy of standard radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer.
We investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy.
In vivo experiments with Wistar rats were performed in order to assess immunohistochemically changes in the intracellular accumulation of HIF1 alpha induced by amifostine.
Incubation of cell lines with amifostine resulted in HIF1 alpha induction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The glucose and oxygen levels in the peripheral blood of patients receiving 1000 mg amifostine were determined at various time-points in order to investigate the metabolic changes induced by amifostine.
Its mechanism of action is attributed to the free radical scavenging properties of its active dephosphorylated metabolite WR-1065.
This up-regulation of VEGF-A mRNA was accompanied by an increased secretion of VEGF-A proteins fully active in stimulating vascular endothelial cells.
VEGF-A induction by WR-1065 depends on the activation of the eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway.
