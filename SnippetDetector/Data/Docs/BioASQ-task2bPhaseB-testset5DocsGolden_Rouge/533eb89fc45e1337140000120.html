The key-protein that when associated with HREs leads to the activation of all of these genes, is identified asβ€�Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1β€� (HIF1).
It is a heterodimer composed of two subunits (IIF1a 120kDa and HIF-1b 91-94kDa), both of which belong to the group of "basic helix-loop-helix" (bHLH)-Pas proteins.
The heterodimer HIF1 and IIF2 increase in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to hypoxia.
