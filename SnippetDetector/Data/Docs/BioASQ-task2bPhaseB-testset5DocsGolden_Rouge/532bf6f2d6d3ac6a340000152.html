The - secretase complex is responsible for intramembrane processing of over 60 substrates and is involved in Notch signaling as well as in the generation of the amyloid - peptide.
Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which is fundamental for neuronal development and specification.
The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that - secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure.
Alzheimer's disease research has been at an impasse in recent years with lingering questions about the involvement of Amyloid -.
In this review, we will discuss old and novel Notch targets and molecular mediators that contribute to Notch function in the mature brain and will summarize recent findings that explore the two facets of Notch signaling in brain physiology and pathology.
Along with - secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid - protein of Alzheimer's disease from the amyloid - protein precursor.
Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch.
RIP regulates signaling pathways by abrogating or releasing signaling molecules.
- Secretase is a membrane embedded aspartyl protease complex with presenilin as the catalytic component.
