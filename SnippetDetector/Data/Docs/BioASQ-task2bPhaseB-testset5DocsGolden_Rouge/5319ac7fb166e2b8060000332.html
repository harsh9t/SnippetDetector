Targeting invadopodia to block breast cancer metastasis  Twist1-induced invadopodia formation promotes tumor metastasis  FHOD1, a poorly studied formin, appeared to be markedly upregulated upon EMT.
Hic-5 promotes invadopodia formation and invasion during TGF-Ξ²-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition  Podosomes and invadopodia are actin-based structures at the ventral cell membrane, which have a role in cell adhesion, migration and invasion.
These data identify Hic-5 as a critical mediator of TGF-Ξ²-stimulated invadopodia formation, cell migration, and invasion.
Podosome-like structures of non-invasive carcinoma cells are replaced in epithelial-mesenchymal transition by actin comet-embedded invadopodia  Invadopodia are considered to be crucial structures that allow cancer cells to penetrate across the extracellular matrix (ECM) by using matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
Transforming growth factor Ξ² (TGF-Ξ²)-stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important developmental process that has also been implicated in increased cell invasion and metastatic potential of cancer cells.
