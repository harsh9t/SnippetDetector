We investigated the role of c-jun in normal and preneoplastic hepatocyte proliferation induced by ligands of nuclear receptors, which cause liver hyperplasia in the absence of cell loss/death.
Although mechanical stress has been implicated in hepatic cirrhosis and liver regeneration following hepatectomy, the signaling pathway that may be activated in hepatocytes in response to mechanical stress have not been determined.
Mechanical stress is known to activate signaling cascades, including mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.
The c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway enhances graft injury after liver transplantation ( LT ).
Notably, JNK activity was markedly increased and sustained in livers of Gadd45b mice compared with control animals after partial hepatectomy.
Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.
In conclusion, thirty eight paths of JNK signaling pathway regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in both LR and AHF occurrence.
The effect of the arsenite-injection on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase was not observed in the normal or the partially hepatectomized liver.
CD40 is critically involved in Fas-mediated cholangiocyte apoptosis during liver inflammation, but the underlying signalling events are poorly understood.
