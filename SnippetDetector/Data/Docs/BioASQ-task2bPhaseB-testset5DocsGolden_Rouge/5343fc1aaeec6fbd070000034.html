BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a common disorder of dysregulated tissue growth secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by deletions, insertions, translocations, and point mutations in the NF1 gene, which spans 350 kb on the long arm of human chromosome 17.
RESULTS: GISTs from both patients were of wild type for mutations in KIT and PDGFRA.
BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a neurocutaneous disorder resulting in the growth of a variety of tumors, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
Individuals with NF1 harbor 1 mutated NF1 allele causing heterozygous expression in all of their cells.
mutations in the FLR exon of the NF1 gene were not detected in any of the AML samples.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, and the NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, can downregulate the N-ras gene.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common genetic disease affecting the nervous system.
The NF1 gene, mutated in NF1, is also commonly mutated in sporadic glioblastoma multiforme.
Many mutations of the NF1 gene have been reported in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1; however, there have been no documented NF1 gene mutations in Japanese NF1 patients.
