Hence, these are the main risk factors that should be considered first of all in daily clinical practice.
UNLABELLED: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance, is dramatically increasing in Western and developing countries.
INTRODUCTION: The metabolic syndrome components, such as dyslipidemia, prothrombotic status, and increased blood pressure, are risk factors for patients with renal disease.
The aim of the study was to identify risk factors of Charcot neuroarthropathy occurrence in patients with diabetic foot and type 2 diabetes.
UNLABELLED: We investigated the association between circulating levels of 60 and 70 kDa heat-shock proteins and cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women with or without metabolic syndrome ( MetS ).
In this study, we aim to examine the associations of obesity related loci with risk of metabolic syndrome in a children population from China.
The pattern of appearance of dyslipidemia also varies in children with risk factors even in the pre-pubertal group from those without risk.
UNLABELLED: Cardiometabolic disorders have been associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, while the relationship of cardiovascular risk score ( CRS ) and metabolic syndrome ( MS ) with different clinical presentation of PHPT remains undefined.
