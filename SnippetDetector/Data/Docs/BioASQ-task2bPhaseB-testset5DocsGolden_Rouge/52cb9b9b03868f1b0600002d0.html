Bladder cancer is any of several types of malignancy arising from the epithelial lining of the urinary bladder.
Rarely the bladder is involved by non-epithelial cancers, such as lymphoma or sarcoma.
It is a disease in which abnormal cells multiply without control in the bladder.
The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine; it is located in the pelvis.
The most common type of bladder cancer recapitulates the normal histology of the urothelium and is known as transitional cell carcinoma or more properly urothelial cell carcinoma.
It is estimated that there are 383,000 cases of bladder cancer worldwide.
