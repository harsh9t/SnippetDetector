HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells.
Moreover, acetylation of Ξ±-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6).
We propose that lower HDAC6 levels combined with decreased microtubule binding lead to increased tubulin acetylation in ethanol-treated cells.
Tubulin is a major substrate of the cytoplasmic class II histone deacetylase HDAC6.
Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules.
The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability.
