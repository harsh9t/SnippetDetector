grobacterium tumefaciens infects plants and induces the formation of tumors called  crown galls  by integrating the transferred-DNA (T-DNA) region of the Ti-plasmid into the plant nuclear genome  grobacterium tumefaciens induces crown gall tumors on plants by transferring a nucleoprotein complex, the T-complex, from the bacterium to the plant cell   gall tumors develop after integration of the T-DNA of virulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains into the plant genome  Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease in a wide range of plant species.
The neoplastic growth at the infection sites is caused by transferring, integrating, and expressing transfer DNA (T-DNA) from A.
tumefaciens into plant cells.
