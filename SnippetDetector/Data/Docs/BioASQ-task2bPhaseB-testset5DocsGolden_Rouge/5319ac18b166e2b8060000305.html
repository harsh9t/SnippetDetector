E-cadherin plays a pivotal role in epithelial morphogenesis.
Here we show that E-cadherin polarity is controlled by the polarized regulation of clathrin - and dynamin-mediated endocytosis.
Blocking E-cadherin endocytosis resulted in cell intercalation defects.
E-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junction in epithelial cells and continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae depending on the cell type.
Collectively, SMAP1 likely represents a key Arf6GAP in clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin in MDCK cells.
Further, p120 knockdown by small interference RNA resulted in dose-dependent elimination of cell surface E-cadherin.
This activity of SMAP1 in E-cadherin turnover may be involved in epithelial organization and/or epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
The endocytosis of E-cadherin has recently emerged as an important determinant of cadherin function with the potential to participate in remodeling adhesive contacts.
E-cadherin is a member of the cadherin family of Ca2 + - dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules.
Surface-labeling techniques were used to define the endocytic itinerary of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells and in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human E-cadherin.
The E-cadherin distribution is also planar polarized and complementary to the Myosin-II distribution.
Notably, AMAP2/DDEF2 rather enhanced the caveolae-mediated incorporation of a membrane protein other than E-cadherin.
