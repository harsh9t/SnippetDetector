Several basic proteins, including the ubiquitous HU proteins, serve histone-like functions in prokaryotes.
Prokaryotic histone-like proteins are abundant proteins found in bacterial and plastid nucleoids.
In mesophilic prokaryotes, the DNA-binding protein HU participates in nucleoid organization as well as in regulation of DNA-dependent processes.
Little is known about the structure and function of most nucleoid-associated proteins in bacteria.
The proteins are related in that all bind to DNA and are implicated in the compact organization of the chromosome.
The repression of transcription of two overlapping promoters of the gal operon in Escherichia coli requires Gal repressor and the histone-like protein HU.
HU was shown to participate in vitro in the initiation of DNA replication as an accessory factor to assist the action of DnaA protein in the unwinding of oriC DNA.
The molecular characteristics of cPHB and its presence in histone-like and histone proteins of diverse organisms suggest it may play a role in DNA binding and/or DNA organization.
The solvating properties and cellular distribution of cPHB suggest it may be associated with proteins that bind and/or transfer DNA.
Little is known about nucleoid organization in thermophilic eubacteria.
