A number of signalling pathways have been found to converge to and activate Rac1, which, in turn, activates a number of downstream targets to control actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles, as well as formation and activity of lamellipodia, to regulate the migratory processes leading to cell invasion.
