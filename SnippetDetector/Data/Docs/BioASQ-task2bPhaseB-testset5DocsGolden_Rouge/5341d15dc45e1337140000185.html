Apoptosis is a physiological method of cell death commonly referred to as programmed cell death.
Relatively little is known about programmed cell death in plants.
There are several ways to classify the different types of autophagy.
Autophagy and senescence share a number of characteristics, which suggests that both responses could serve to collaterally protect the cell from the toxicity of external stress such as radiation and chemotherapy and internal forms of stress such as telomere shortening and oncogene activation.
In particular, during microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy, uptake occurs directly at the limiting membrane of the lysosome or vacuole.
The current working definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled.
Upon a slightly more lenient definition the ` autolytic ' class of plant PCD can be merged with the autophagic PCD type in animal cells.
There is a growing consensus that autophagy is upregulated in the setting of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.
Autophagy is the endogenous, tightly regulated cellular ``housekeeping '' process responsible for the degradation of damaged and dysfunctional cellular organelles and protein aggregates.
Not surprisingly, the death of a cell is a complex and well controlled process.
