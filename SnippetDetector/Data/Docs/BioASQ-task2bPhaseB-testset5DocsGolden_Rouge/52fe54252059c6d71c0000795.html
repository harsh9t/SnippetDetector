In particular, the distribution of HU, which is the most abundant NAP, has received little attention.
In higher cells the bulk of DNA is organised with histones in the form of nucleosomes.
The presence of cPHB in H-NS and histones was confirmed by chemical assay.
Western blot analysis of the calf thymus histones indicated that each contained cPHB.
The proteins are related in that all bind to DNA and are implicated in the compact organization of the chromosome.
Prokaryotic histone-like proteins are abundant proteins found in bacterial and plastid nucleoids.
Several basic proteins, including the ubiquitous HU proteins, serve histone-like functions in prokaryotes.
In mesophilic prokaryotes, the DNA-binding protein HU participates in nucleoid organization as well as in regulation of DNA-dependent processes.
In bacteria, this is because the promoter -10 hexamer, the major DNA element recognized by RNA polymerase, is itself AT-rich.
Visibly the HU composition is sensitive to the different states of DnaA, and may play a role during the regulation of the initiation process of the DNA replication by affecting subsequent events along the cell cycle.
The communication between distant DNA sites occurs by interaction between proteins bound to the sites by looping out the intervening DNA segments.
