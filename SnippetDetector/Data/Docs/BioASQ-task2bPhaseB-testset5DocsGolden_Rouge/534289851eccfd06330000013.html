Radioprotective effects of amifostine.
Amifostine inhibits angiogenesis in vivo  Amifostine-antioxidant drug in anticancer therapy.
Amifostine was developed to protect normal tissues from radiation exposure  In vivo mesna and amifostine do not prevent chloroacetaldehyde nephrotoxicity in vitro  Amifostine protects bone marrow from benzene-induced hematotoxicity in mice.
(AMF) has been shown to protect some normal tissues from acute effects of radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy  Doxorubicin induces apoptosis in germ line stem cells in the immature rat testis and amifostine cannot protect against this cytotoxicity  Amifostine has shown to selectively protect normal tissues against cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of several anti-neoplastic drugs, such as alkylating agents, organoplatinum compounds, anthracyclines, taxanes, and ionising radiati  Amifostine has been shown to protect against xerostomia induced by radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, but its impact on the therapeutic index is unknown.
This is the first report focusing on amifostine related adverse effects leading to discontinuation of amifostine treatment.
