Chromosome analysis is an important and difficult task for clinical diagnosis and biological research.
Recently, we developed novel software for the automated evaluation of FISH images and, in this study, we present the first testing of this software on images from two separate research clinics.
The evaluation shows that the developed FISH image analysis software can accelerate evaluation of HER2 status in most breast cancer cases.
Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity.
Signal segmentation and classification of fluorescence in situ hybridization images are essential for the detection of cytogenetic abnormalities.
A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization, has been developed to ease the analysis of the process.
Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis.
The study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images.
Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell.
AVAILABILITY: FISH Finder is a standalone MATLAB application and platform independent software.
