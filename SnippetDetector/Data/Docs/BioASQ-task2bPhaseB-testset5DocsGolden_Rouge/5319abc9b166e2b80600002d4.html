The Rho GTPases organize the actin cytoskeleton and are involved in cancer metastasis.
Epidermal growth factor may increase cell motility, an event implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion.
Previously, we demonstrated that RhoC GTPase was required for PC-3 prostate cancer cell invasion.
Dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 were stably expressed in the most metastatic cell variant.
We report that Binder of Arl Two plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells.
Dysregulation of cell adhesion and motility is known to be an important factor in the development of tumor malignancy.
We established a PAR1 stably transfected MKN45 gastric cancer cell line.
We identified neuropilin-1 as a mediator of cancer cell invasion by a functional proteomic screen and showed its role in GBM cells.
Taken together, these results suggest a role for both the Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases in human breast cancer progression.
Together, our data suggest that Rac1 GTPase is key mediator of prostate cancer cell-bone marrow endothelial cell interactions.
Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells.
