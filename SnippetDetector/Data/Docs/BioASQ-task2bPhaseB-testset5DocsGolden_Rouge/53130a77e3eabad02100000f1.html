We report on three patients with Costello syndrome and isolated growth hormone (GH) deficiency treated with biosynthetic GH.
To our knowledge, these are the only patients with Costello syndrome who have been successfully treated for GH deficiency.
We review the pathophysiology of Costello syndrome and highlight the recent recommendations of tumor screening and cardiac surveillance in this population, of particular relevance to those receiving GH therapy.
