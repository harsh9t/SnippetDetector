To morphometrically quantify CD1a+ dentritic cells and DC-SIGN+ dendritic cells in HIV-positive patients with anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and to evaluate the effects of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy and HPV infection on epithelial and subepithelial dendritic cells.
BAFF system plays a key role in the development of autoimmunity, especially in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
This often leads to the assumption that BAFF is mostly a B cell factor with a specific role in autoimmunity.

Far from being SLE-specific, the BAFF system has a much broader relevance in infection, cancer and allergy.
