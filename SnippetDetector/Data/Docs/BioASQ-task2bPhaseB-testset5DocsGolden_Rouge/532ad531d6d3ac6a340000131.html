heavy chain variable domains (VH) lacking their light chain (VL) partner are prime candidates for the design of minimum-size immunoreagents.
Antibodies are prototypes of multimeric proteins and consist of structurally similar domains.
The two variable domains of an antibody (VH and VL) interact through a large hydrophobic interface and can be expressed as covalently linked single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments.
e formation of an early intermediate, which shows amide-proton exchange protection, is independent of proline isomerization.
Subsequently, a proline cis-trans isomerization reaction in the rapidly formed intermediate, producing  non-native  isomers, competes with the fast formation of native species.
Interface formation in a folding intermediate of the scFv fragment is proposed to prevent the back-isomerization of these prolines from being efficiently catalyzed by cyclophilin.
