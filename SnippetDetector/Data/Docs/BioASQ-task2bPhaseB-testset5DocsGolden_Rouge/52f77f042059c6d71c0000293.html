METHODS: The clinical data of 22 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex complicated with renal angiomyolipoma were analyzed retrospectively.
A prospective study was undertaken to assess the value of ultrasonography in the clinical monitoring of angiomyolipomas.
The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical picture of TSC in patients with an identical TSC2 mutation.
A standardized clinical assessment of TSC symptoms was used.
In six patients the clinical symptoms were atypical; in those instances computed tomography makes diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis possible.
The first two had clinical symptoms of neurofibromatosis but CT disclosed nodular subependymal calcifications as in tuberous sclerosis.
Cytogenetic analysis of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas from two patients presenting the clinical symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) revealed clonal chromosomal changes, resulting in the partial loss of chromosome 22q in both tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: There are many influencing factors contributing to the diversity of the clinical picture and pathology of TSC.
In none, except one newborn, did we observe any clinical symptoms of heart failure.
no patient had clinical symptoms or complications from hepatic lesions.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to establish a correlation between tuber size and the severity of clinical features in TSC.
