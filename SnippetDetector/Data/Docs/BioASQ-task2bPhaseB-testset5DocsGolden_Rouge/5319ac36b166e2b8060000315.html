The efficient repair of gastrointestinal mucosal injuries is essential in the preservation of the epithelial barrier to luminal antigens.
Protein-protein interactions are essential for many cellular processes.
We observed a significant reduction in cortactin localization and lamellipodia formation in the leading edge of GIT1-depleted endothelial cells.
the functional role of GIT1 in pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown.
EDG-1, encoded by the endothelial differentiation gene-1, is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate ( SPP ) that has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and cell migration in cultured endothelial cells.
Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement.
Cell migration toward platelet-derived growth factor, which stimulates sphingosine kinase and increases intracellular SPP, was dependent on expression of EDG-1.
We demonstrate that this is a result of impaired directional migration of GIT1-depleted endothelial cells toward a vascular endothelial growth factor gradient.
Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis.
These studies set the stage for the development of light-regulated signaling molecules for controlling receptor activation, synapse formation and other signaling events in organisms.
