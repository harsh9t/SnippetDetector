The data support the hypothesis that amyloid fibril formation involves the ordered self-assembly of partially folded species that are critical soluble precursors of fibrils.
To clarify these roles, the secondary structure of J chain was characterized by computer-assisted analyses of human and mouse sequences and by circular dichroism measurements of the isolated J chain.
In the present investigation, the amino acid sequence of SCP2 from rat liver has been determined.
The backbone assignments of the VH made it possible to locate its Protein A binding site.
The secondary structure of the isolated VH is identical to that of heavy chain variable domains in intact antibodies, where VH domains are packed against a VL domain.
In order to delineate the nature of the rate-limiting step, the folding of the scFv fragment of an antibody after short-term denaturation has been investigated.
Sixteen amino acids, defined as Spot critical residues, were identified on the basis of a 50 % decrease in CD4 binding to alanine analogs of reactive peptides.
We analyzed antigen-binding residues from the variable domains of anti-CD4 antibody 13B8.
2 using the Spot method of parallel peptide synthesis.
The five remaining Fab mutants showed antigen-binding properties similar to those of wild-type Fab.
