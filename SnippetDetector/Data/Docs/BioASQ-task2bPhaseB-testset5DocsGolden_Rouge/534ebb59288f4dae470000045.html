It was recently discovered that RTT is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene.
Severely arrhythmic breathing is a hallmark of Rett syndrome and profoundly affects quality of life for patients and their families.
Rett syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 ( MECP2 ).
The last decade has seen the identification of the disease-causing gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 and the development of mouse models that phenocopy many aspects of the human syndrome, including breathing dysfunction.
RTT patients and Mecp2-null mice exhibit reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which has been linked in mice to increased respiratory frequency, a hallmark of RTT.
Rett syndrome results from loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 ( MeCP2 ) and is characterized by abnormal motor, respiratory and autonomic control, cognitive impairment, autistic-like behaviors and increased risk of seizures.
Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in females, typically after the first year of life.
In the present work, we use Mecp2 mutant mouse models and the olfactory system to investigate dendritic development.
Evidence to date suggests that these disorders display defects in synaptic organization and plasticity.
