Sj gren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by clonal B cell attack of the exocrine glands and dysregulated expression of B cell-activating factor ( BAFF ).
To address the role of B cells in Sj gren's syndrome and autoimmune disease, we studied the effect of CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment on the disease in Id3 knockout mice.
NOD.
B10-H2b mice manifest many features of SjS, exhibiting exocrine gland dysfunction concomitant with leukocyte infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
Here we characterize the development of the autoimmune dacryoadenitis in NOD/LtJ and NOD.
B10-H2 mice in comparison with age - and sex-matched nonautoimmune CD1 mice.
Sj gren's syndrome is a human autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of exocrine function as a result of a chronic immune attack directed primarily against the salivary and lacrimal glands leading to xerostomia ( dry mouth ) and xerophthalmia ( dry eyes ).
NOD.
IL-4 - / - mice that received adoptively transferred T lymphocytes derived from NOD.
NOD mice manifest many features of autoimmune exocrinopathy, a disease generally characterized by a chronic, progressive immunological attack against the exocrine tissues of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
Accordingly, apoptosis, fibrosis and atrophy of the salivary glands would represent consequences of salivary gland hypofunction.
