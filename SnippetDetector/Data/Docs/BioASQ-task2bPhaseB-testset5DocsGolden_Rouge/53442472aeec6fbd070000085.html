EPH family receptor tyrosine kinases and ligand ephrins play pivotal roles in neural and cardiovascular development.
EphA2 seems to be functionally important in GBM cells and thus may play an important role in GBM pathogenesis.
Ephrins and their Eph receptors play important roles in the development of central nervous system and the regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion.
Accumulating evidence indicates that Eph and ephrins are frequently overexpressed in different tumor types including GBM.
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ephrin-B2 localization primarily in GBM cells but not in normal brain.
We have previously shown that the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme and represents a novel, attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of brain tumors.
We investigated the presence of EphA2, and its ligand, ephrinA1, in glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant neoplasm of glial cells, and normal brain.
Based on kinase-activity profiling data published recently, we hypothesized a key role for the Eph/ephrin signaling system in medulloblastoma invasion.
BACKGROUND: Eph receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, represent a large class of cell-cell communication molecules with well-defined developmental functions.
linked ligand for the EphA2 receptor, which is overexpressed in glioblastoma, among other cancers.
