The expression of iGb3 and its precursor, iGb4, on tumor cells may prime an effective iNKT cell-dependent antitumor response, modulated negatively by GM3 which is also produced in these cells.
iGb3-primed BMDC exerted a significant iNKT cell-mediated anti-tumor activity in mice challenged with melanoma cells.
Survivin expression is a poor prognostic marker in a number of cancers.
Notoriously in patients with severe anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the density of CD1a + epithelial dendritic cells was influenced by the viral load of HIV-1.
PURPOSE: To morphometrically quantify CD1a + dentritic cells and DC-SIGN + dendritic cells in HIV-positive patients with anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and to evaluate the effects of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy and HPV infection on epithelial and subepithelial dendritic cells.
In this review, we provide the latest views on additional roles of the BAFF system in health and diseases, as well as an update on BAFF and autoimmunity, with particular focus on current clinical trials.
Dendritic cells are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system and represent a promising tool in therapeutic vaccination against cancer.
A better understanding of how dentritic cells succeed to induce and modulate immunity is necessary to optimally exploit dentritic cells in anticancer vaccines.
