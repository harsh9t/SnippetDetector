We conclude that Lu and Qu attenuate the phosphorylation of cortactin and Src in A431-III cells.
Induction of PDGFR and invadopodia is essential for Twist1 to promote tumor metastasis.
We show that Twist1 and PDGFR are central mediators of invadopodia formation in response to various EMT-inducing signals.
Here, we report that Twist1 is capable of promoting the formation of invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions for extracellular matrix degradation.
Recently, invadopodia have been increasingly recognized as important drivers of local invasion in metastasis.
Finally, FHOD1 depletion reduced the ability of EMT cancer cells to form invadopodia and to degrade extracellular matrix.
We studied podosome-like structures of oral squamous carcinoma cells and invadopodia of their invasive variant that has undergone a spontaneous epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
Podosomes and invadopodia are actin-based structures at the ventral cell membrane, which have a role in cell adhesion, migration and invasion.
Twist, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is involved in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, which play an essential role in cancer metastasis.
The mechanisms of cytoskeletal reorganisation resulting in mesenchymal morphology and increased invasive potential are poorly understood.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated faster reorganization of actin, cortactin and filamin A in podosomes compared to invadopodia.
