Yes it is.
The UGA stop codon was found to code for seleno-cysteine in a number of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, whereas the UAG stop codon was shown to code for pyrro-lysine in some archaean species.
Moreover, in experimental and therapeutic settings, aminoglycoside-induced stop codon bypass has been used to restore protein translation by promoting readthrough of stop codons, generated by mutations causing premature termination of protein synthesis.
Additionally, cytosine deamination to uracil in stop codons may result in stop codon bypass, whereas in a number of polycistronic genes or sequential ORFs, there is evidence for stop codon bypass, although their induction mechanisms are still unclear.
Additional hypotheses for stop codon bypass involve the 3' context of the translated transcript, non-conventional anticodon-codon interactions or translational frameshifts.
