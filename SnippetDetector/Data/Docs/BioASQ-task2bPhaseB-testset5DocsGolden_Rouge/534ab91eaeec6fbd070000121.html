Thus, methylated RARΞ²(2) and APC genes might be valuable urinary molecular markers for early detection of bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer.
Recently, methylation of the TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain) gene was reported in human colon, gastric, and bladder cancer cells.
Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript.
Exon 2 methylation inhibits hepaCAM expression in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder  The methylation rate of hepaCAM exon 2 was significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues.
the expression of hepaCAM was absent in T24 and BIU-87 cells, and we found that exon 2 of hepaCAM was methylated in the 2 cells.
Among the 128 patients with bilharzial bladder cancer, 94 (73.
4%) showed methylated RARΞ²(2) and 86 (67.
2%) showed methylated APC.
