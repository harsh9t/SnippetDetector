In the present work, we use Mecp2 mutant mouse models and the olfactory system to investigate dendritic development.
Rett syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 ( MECP2 ).
Evidence to date suggests that these disorders display defects in synaptic organization and plasticity.
Severely arrhythmic breathing is a hallmark of Rett syndrome and profoundly affects quality of life for patients and their families.
Recent studies have begun to characterize the breathing phenotype of Mecp2 mutant mice and to define underlying electrophysiological and neurochemical deficits.
Favorable X inactivation can so spare a patient from the effects of mutant MECP2 that they display only the mildest learning disability or no phenotype at all.
It was recently discovered that RTT is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene.
We found that Het mice exhibit reduced BDNF expression and TrkB activation in the medulla and pons and (2) breathing dysfunction, characterized by increased frequency due to periods of tachypnea, and increased apneas, as in RTT patients.
RTT patients and Mecp2-null mice exhibit reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which has been linked in mice to increased respiratory frequency, a hallmark of RTT.
