The c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway enhances graft injury after liver transplantation ( LT ).
Thus, modulation of JNK activity is crucial to the liver response to TNFR-mediated challenge.
Although mechanical stress has been implicated in hepatic cirrhosis and liver regeneration following hepatectomy, the signaling pathway that may be activated in hepatocytes in response to mechanical stress have not been determined.
In conclusion, our data show that JNK drives G0 to G1 transition in hepatocytes and that cyclin D1 is a downstream target of the JNK pathway during liver regeneration.
Many growth factors and cytokines are involved in liver regeneration.
The c-Jun-N-terminal kinase pathway is strongly activated after partial hepatectomy ( PH ), but its role in hepatocyte proliferation is not known.
In the liver, the JNK cascade is induced downstream of TNF receptors in response to inflammatory, microbial, and toxic challenges.
CD40 is critically involved in Fas-mediated cholangiocyte apoptosis during liver inflammation, but the underlying signalling events are poorly understood.
We discuss how this reprogramming could be orchestrated by the initial activity of the JNK pathway.
Mechanical stress is known to activate signaling cascades, including mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.
Moreover, silencing of c-jun in the liver of CD-1 mice caused increased hepatocyte proliferation.
