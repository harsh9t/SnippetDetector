The glucose and oxygen levels in the peripheral blood of patients receiving 1000 mg amifostine were determined at various time-points in order to investigate the metabolic changes induced by amifostine.
MDA468 breast tumor cell lines were incubated with a high amifostine concentration (10 m M) to overcome the natural resistance of cancer cells to influx of the non-hydrolyzed WR-2721, and the HIF1 alpha protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis.
