a role in protein import related to maintenance of mitochondrial structure is suggested as mitofilin helps regulate mitochondrial morphology and at least four of the associated proteins have been implicated in protein import, while DnaJC11 is a chaperone-like protein that may have a similar role.
This mAb immunocaptures its target protein in association with six other proteins, metaxins 1 and 2, SAM50, CHCHD3, CHCHD6 and DnaJC11, respectively.
The first three are outer membrane proteins, CHCHD3 has been assigned to the matrix space, and the other two proteins have not been described in mitochondria previously.
A monoclonal antibody has been produced which reacts with human mitofilin, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein.
