definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled  As a general definition, autophagy encompasses a range of processes in which the cell degrades parts of itself within the lysosome (or the analogous organelle, the vacuole, in yeast and plants), followed by the release and reuse of the breakdown products  autophagy, a process in which de novo formed membrane enclosed vesicles engulf and consume cellular components  utophagy has been predominantly studied as a nonselective self-digestion process that recycles macromolecules and produces energy in response to starvation  utophagy is the endogenous, tightly regulated cellular  housekeeping  process responsible for the degradation of damaged and dysfunctional cellular organelles and protein aggregates   non-apoptotic programmed cell death, such as autophagy   utophagy is a ubiquitous eukaryotic cytoplasmic quality and quantity control pathway  utophagy is a catabolic trafficking pathway for bulk destruction and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles via regulated lysosomal degradation.
