These studies set the stage for the development of light-regulated signaling molecules for controlling receptor activation, synapse formation and other signaling events in organisms.
Cell migration toward platelet-derived growth factor, which stimulates sphingosine kinase and increases intracellular SPP, was dependent on expression of EDG-1.
EDG-1 is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate ( SPP ).
Our results reveal a role for receptor cross-communication in which activation of a GPCR by a receptor tyrosine kinase is critical for cell motility.
Moreover, PDGF activated EDG-1, as measured by translocation of beta-arrestin and phosphorylation of EDG-1.
Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement.
the functional role of GIT1 in pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown.
We observed a significant reduction in cortactin localization and lamellipodia formation in the leading edge of GIT1-depleted endothelial cells.
We specifically identified that the Spa homology domain of GIT1 is required for GIT1-cortactin complex localization to the leading edge.
We demonstrate that this is a result of impaired directional migration of GIT1-depleted endothelial cells toward a vascular endothelial growth factor gradient.
