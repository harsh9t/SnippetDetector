Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 expression in pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with lymph node metastases and we found a significant correlation between Slug and MMP-9 expression; however, no significant correlation was observed between Slug and E-cadherin expression.
The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo.
In this study, we investigated the role of fascin, a cytoskeleton actin-bundling protein involved in the formation of filopodia and cell migration, in prostate cancer progression.
Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that induces membrane protrusions and cell motility after the formation of lamellipodia or filopodia.
Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis.
Here, we report that CRP1 colocalizes with actin in the filopodia of growth cones in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.
Fascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types.
These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family.
Fascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia and filopodia.
The regulation of actin bundling by specific actin binding proteins is likely to play an important role in many growth cone behaviors.
