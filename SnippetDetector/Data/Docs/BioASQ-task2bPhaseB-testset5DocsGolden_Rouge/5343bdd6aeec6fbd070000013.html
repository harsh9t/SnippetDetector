pol-II accumulated in the 5 -region of the gene, which indicated postinitiation pausing.
pol-II binding, 5 -accumulation, C-terminal domain Ser-5 and Ser-2 phosphorylation  The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here.
