The overall effect of the microenvironment is to support the growth of tumors and suppress immune responses.
Immunotherapy is a highly promising form of cancer treatment, but its efficacy can be severely compromised by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
Chemotherap   we analyzed NY-ESO-1 expression in 222 melanoma specimens, including 16 primary and 206 metastatic tumors.
Our results support previous findings showing higher expression of NY-ESO-1 in metastatic (58/206; 28.
2%) versus primary (0/16) tumors.
In addition, our results show that the epithelioid subtype of melanoma has the highest incidence of NY-ESO-1 expression.
