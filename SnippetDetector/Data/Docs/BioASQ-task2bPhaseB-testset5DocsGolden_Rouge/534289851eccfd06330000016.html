Multiple phase I studies were carried out with amifostine in combination with chemotherapy for various neoplasms.
Preclinical studies demonstrate that amifostine has the potential to selectively protect normal tissues from the harmful effects of radiation without significantly protecting neoplastic tissue.
The authors utilized an established mouse model to determine the protective effect of amifostine on benzene-induced bone marrow hematotoxicity.
This is the first report focusing on amifostine related adverse effects leading to discontinuation of amifostine treatment.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amifostine has been shown to protect against xerostomia induced by radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, but its impact on the therapeutic index is unknown.
BACKGROUND: Amifostine was developed to protect normal tissues from radiation exposure.
Experimental studies have shown that vinorelbine is a powerful radiosensitizer in vitro.
Differences in the alkaline phosphatase concentration of normal versus tumor tissues can result in greater conversion of amifostine in normal tissues.
It is a prodrug of free thiol that may act as a scavenger of free radicals generated in tissues exposed to cytotoxic drugs and binds to reactive metabolites of such drugs.
Amifostine is an inorganic thiophosphate-cytoprotective agent developed to selectively protect normal tissues against the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation.
