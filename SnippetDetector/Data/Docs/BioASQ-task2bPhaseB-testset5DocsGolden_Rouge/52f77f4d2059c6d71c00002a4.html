The cap analogues are incorporated by RNA polymerase into mRNA transcripts that are efficiently translated in vitro.
In mammals, cap synthesis is catalysed by the sequential action of RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5 -phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase), enzymes recruited to RNA pol II (polymerase II) during the early stages of transcription.
Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II (polymerase II) transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5  phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase).
