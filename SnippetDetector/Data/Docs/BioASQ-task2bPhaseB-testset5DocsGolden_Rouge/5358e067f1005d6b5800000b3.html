Fascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types.
Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that induces membrane protrusions and cell motility after the formation of lamellipodia or filopodia.
Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis.
Fascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia and filopodia.
Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia.
Expression of CRP1 with a constitutively active form of Cdc42, a GTPase involved in filopodia formation, increases filopodia formation in COS-7 cells, suggesting cooperation between the two proteins.
Growth cones at the distal tips of growing nerve axons contain bundles of actin filaments distributed throughout the lamellipodium and that project into filopodia.
Eps8 is involved in actin dynamics through its actin barbed-ends capping activity and its ability to modulate Rac activity.
The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo.
The regulation of actin bundling by specific actin binding proteins is likely to play an important role in many growth cone behaviors.
The cysteine-rich protein family is a subgroup of LIM domain proteins.
