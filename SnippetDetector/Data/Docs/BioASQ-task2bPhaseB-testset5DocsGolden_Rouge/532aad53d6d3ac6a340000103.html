This allowed us to propose a model for the structure of the full-length WNV NS5 by in silico docking of the WNV MTase domain onto the RdRp domain.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the non-structural protein 5 ( NS5 ) is a key activity for viral RNA replication.
Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.
The flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase in its N-terminal 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRP ) within the C-terminal part.
Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5.
Viruses of the family Flaviviridae are important human and animal pathogens.
In this study, crystal structures of enzymatically active and inactive WNV RdRp domains were determined at 3.
0 - and 2.
35-A resolution, respectively.
The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure GpppA ( 2 ` OMe ) ) at the 5 ' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2 ` O-methyltransferase activities.
It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed.
