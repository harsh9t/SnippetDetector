As a general definition, autophagy encompasses a range of processes in which the cell degrades parts of itself within the lysosome (or the analogous organelle, the vacuole, in yeast and plants), followed by the release and reuse of the breakdown products  definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled  utophagy is the endogenous, tightly regulated cellular  housekeeping  process responsible for the degradation of damaged and dysfunctional cellular organelles and protein aggregates  utophagy is a catabolic trafficking pathway for bulk destruction and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles via regulated lysosomal degradation.
utophagy has been predominantly studied as a nonselective self-digestion process that recycles macromolecules and produces energy in response to starvation.
