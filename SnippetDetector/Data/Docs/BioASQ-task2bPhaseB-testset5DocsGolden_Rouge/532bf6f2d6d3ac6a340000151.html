In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates.
We have investigated how the four evenly spaced and conserved cysteine residues in the Nct ectodomain affect APP and Notch processing.
Nicastrin is part of the - secretase complex and has been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition and selection.
Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch.
Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of - secretase results in Notch-related side effects.
Aggregated forms of A have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the A levels by inhibiting - secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease.
The - secretase complex is responsible for intramembrane processing of over 60 substrates and is involved in Notch signaling as well as in the generation of the amyloid - peptide.
Along with - secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid - protein of Alzheimer's disease from the amyloid - protein precursor.
- Secretase is a membrane embedded aspartyl protease complex with presenilin as the catalytic component.
