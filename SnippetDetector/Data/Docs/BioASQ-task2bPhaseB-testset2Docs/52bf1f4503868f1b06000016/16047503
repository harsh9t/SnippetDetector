The study examines the effect of different types of antipsychotic treatment on the health related quality of life (HRQL) of people with schizophrenia under naturalistic outpatient treatment conditions. In a prospective study design, 307 schizophrenic patients were followed over a period of 2.5 years. HRQL, clinical characteristics, and type of antipsychotic medication were assessed five times every 6 months. HRQL was assessed by the SF-36. Random effect regression models were computed for the SF-36 mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component scores. Propensity scores were included in the regression models to reduce a possible sample selection bias. Monotherapeutic treatment with new atypical neuroleptic drugs had a more positive effect on the mental health related quality of life (MCS) in comparison to treatment with polypharmacological treatment but not with oral conventional antipsychotics. Monopharmaceutical treatment with depot-antipsychotic drugs had a more positive effect on the physical health related quality of life (PCS) in comparison to polypharmacological treatment. Study results indicate that atypical antipsychotic drugs are not superior to conventional antipsychotics with regard to the effect on QOL. However, monopharmaceutical treatment can be assumed to be more effective in improving mental and physical related QOL than polypharmaceutical treatment.
