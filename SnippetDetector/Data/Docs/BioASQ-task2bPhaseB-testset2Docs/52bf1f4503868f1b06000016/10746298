Atypical neuroleptic drugs have enriched our treatment programs, especially in childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. Reviewed here is the use of atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents with a schizophrenic disorder. The receptor binding profile and pharmacological properties, indications, side effects, clinical application, and trials of atypical neuroleptic drugs are compared to the classical neuroleptic drug haloperidol in the treatment of adolescent schizophrenia. Special attention is paid to the most common atypical neuroleptics clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone since most studies are carried out with these compounds, most often with clozapine. More clinically controlled trials have to be conducted since only one has been performed to date. The place of atypical neuroleptic drugs is discussed and further studies are necessary in order to differentiate, and eventually broaden the spectrum of the indications tested thus far.
