BACKGROUND: Running a marathon is a stressful event for athletes. Limited research exists on the role of cardiac markers during such a strenuous event. The aim of this study was to investigate detailed changes in cardiac markers before and after a long-distance run. METHODS: We studied 25 male and 2 female runners (age 34-64 years) who were running the Visé-Maastricht-Visé marathon. Blood samples were drawn just before and immediately after finishing the marathon. An additional blood sample was collected 24 h later. RESULTS: Running the marathon led to a significant increase in cortisol. This returned to baseline values 24 h after the marathon. There was a slight increase in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP); however, this was not statistically significant. On the contrary, the N-terminal fragment of BNP (NT-pro-BNP) was significantly increased immediately after the run and was normalized 24 h later in 26 out of 27 runners (96%). The magnitude of the transient elevations in BNP and NT-pro-BNP increased with the age of the athletes. Furthermore, in 9 out of 27 runners there was a significant increase in troponin T. However, in all these runners this increase was transient and troponin-T levels returned to baseline values 24 h after the marathon. CONCLUSIONS: Running a marathon significantly increases NT-pro-BNP levels in healthy adults. This increase could be partially attributed to cardiac stress. The transient increases in BNP, NT-pro-BNP and troponin T are more likely to reflect myocardial stunning than cardiomyocyte damage. It seems that the magnitude of the increase in BNP could serve as a marker of the biological age of the myocardium.
