Jervell Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is a recessive disorder with congenital deafness and long-QT syndrome (LQTS 1). Mutations in the potassium-channel gene KVLQT1 (LQTS 1) have been identified in JLNS and in autosomal-dominant LQTS as well. We performed haplotype analysis with microsatellite markers in a Lebanese family with JLNS, but failed to detect linkage at LQTS 1. Moreover, using this approach, we excluded two other ion-channel genes involved in autosomal-dominant LQTS, HERG (LQTS 2) and SCN5A (LQTS 3). Our findings indicate that JLNS is genetically heterogeneous and that, in this family, an unknown LQTS gene causes the disease.
