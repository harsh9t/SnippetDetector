The study of the epithelium during development in the vertebrate intestine touches upon many contemporary aspects of biology: to name a few, the formation of the adult stem cells (ASCs) essential for the life-long self-renewal and the balance of stem cell activity for renewal vs cancer development. Although extensive analyses have been carried out on the property and functions of the adult intestinal stem cells in mammals, little is known about their formation during development due to the difficulty of manipulating late-stage, uterus-enclosed embryos. The gastrointestinal tract of the amphibian Xenopus laevis is an excellent model system for the study of mammalian ASC formation, cell proliferation, and differentiation. During T3-dependent amphibian metamorphosis, the digestive tract is extensively remodeled from the larval to the adult form for the adaptation of the amphibian from its aquatic herbivorous lifestyle to that of a terrestrial carnivorous frog. This involves de novo formation of ASCs that requires T3 signaling in both the larval epithelium and nonepithelial tissues. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we have characterized the gene expression profiles in the epithelium and nonepithelial tissues by using cDNA microarrays. Our results revealed that T3 induces distinct tissue-specific gene regulation programs associated with the remodeling of the intestine, particularly the formation of the ASCs, and further suggested the existence of potentially many novel stem cell-associated genes, at least in the intestine during development.
