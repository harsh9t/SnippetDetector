The avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) oncoprotein v-ErbA represents a mutated, oncogenic thyroid hormone receptor alpha (c-ErbA/ TRalpha). v-ErbA cooperates with the stem cell factor-activated, endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit to induce self-renewal and to arrest differentiation of primary avian erythroblasts, the AEV transformation target cells. In this cooperation, v-ErbA substitutes for endogenous steroid hormone receptor function required for sustained proliferation of non-transformed erythroid progenitors. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of how v-ErbA transforms erythroblasts. Using culture media strictly depleted from thyroid hormone (T3) and retinoids, the ligands for c-ErbA/TRalpha and its co-receptor RXR, we show that overexpressed, unliganded c-ErbA/ TRalpha closely resembles v-ErbA in its activity on primary erythroblasts. In cooperation with ligand-activated c-Kit, c-ErbA/ TRalpha causes steroid-independent, long-term proliferation and tightly blocks differentiation. Activation of c-ErbA/ TRalpha by physiological T3 levels causes the loss of self-renewal capacity and induces synchronous, terminal differentiation under otherwise identical conditions. This T3-induced switch in erythroid progenitor development is correlated with a decrease of c-ErbA-associated histone deacetylase activity. Our results suggest that the crucial role of the mutations activating v-erbA as an oncogene is to 'freeze' c-ErbA/ TRalpha in its non-liganded, repressive conformation and to facilitate its overexpression.
