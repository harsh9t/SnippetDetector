Low levels of p27Kip1 in primary prostate cancer specimens have been shown to be associated with higher rates of disease recurrence and poor rates of disease-free survival in patients with localized disease. In this study, we provide the first direct evidence showing that dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a major proliferation regulator of prostate cancer, can down-regulate p27Kip1 and stimulate cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) activity in established prostate cancer cell lines. We investigated the cooperative effects of DHT and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the proliferation of androgen-responsive MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b prostate cancer cells. DHT and EGF each stimulated proliferation of these cells, but exposure of the cells to DHT and EGF together stimulated greater proliferation. Stimulation of cell proliferation by DHT and/or EGF was associated with increased CDK2 activity and a decreased level of p27Kip1. There seems to be a positive feedback stimulation loop between androgen-induced gene transcription and EGF-stimulated signal transduction, as one could stimulate the synthesis of the receptors for the other. Dual blockade of androgen receptor function with the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide and EGF receptor superfamily-mediated signal transduction with the anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody C225 and the anti-HER2 receptor monoclonal antibody Herceptin significantly enhanced growth inhibition of the MDA PCa 2a cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of counteracting both androgen receptors and EGF receptors in the development of novel therapies for prostate cancer.
