The HER2/neu oncogene is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer, but the clinical significance of that overexpression is uncertain. In the present study we investigated the antitumor efficacy of Herceptin, a new recombinant humanized anti-HER2/neu antibody, which exhibits cytostatic activity on breast and prostate cancer cells that overexpress the HER2 oncogene. That antibody may retard tumor growth in certain patients with those diseases. We quantified HER2 expression in various human pancreatic cancer cell lines and studied the bioactivity of this antibody both in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition by Herceptin was observed in vitro in cell lines with high levels of HER2/neu expression. Cell lines with low levels of this protein did not respond significantly to the antibody. In vivo we studied two different pancreatic cancer cell lines in an orthotopic mouse model of the disease. Herceptin treatment suppressed tumor growth in the MIA PaCa-2 tumor cell line, which expressed high levels of HER2/neu. These data suggest that Herceptin treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer who express high levels of the HER2/neu oncogene may be reasonable.
