This minireview covers the key data on biology and clinical implications of the c-erbB-2 oncogene in breast and prostate cancer. The aim was to provide basic information to practically oriented pathologists in order to make a reasonable application of methods for c-erbB-2 overexpression or amplification analysis. The clinical interpretation of c-erbB-2 abnormalities should reflect the complexity of c-erbB-2 mediated regulatory pathway and explain why tumours with overexpression/amplification of c-erbB-2 very often do not respond to therapy using Herceptin.
