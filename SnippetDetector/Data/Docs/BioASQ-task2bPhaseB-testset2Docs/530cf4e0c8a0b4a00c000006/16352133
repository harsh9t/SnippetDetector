The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in individuals aged less than 35 years, including competitive athletes, is the inherited disorder hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Until recently, no therapeutic intervention had been identified to prevent sudden death in HCM. This case report highlights the role of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in preventing sudden death in patients with HCM. The report highlights the importance of risk stratification in patients with HCM in order to identify those individuals who would most likely benefit from ICD therapy. The ICD implantation is now the treatment of choice in preventing sudden death in selected (highest risk) populations with HCM. In the future, understanding the molecular basis of sudden death in HCM may identify potential new gene-based therapeutic strategies.
