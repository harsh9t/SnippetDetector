<abstract>
Sudden cardiac death in athletes is usually due to underlying cardiovascular disease. In the young less than 30 years of age, the most common abnormality is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, followed by congenital coronary artery anomalies. The final common pathway is usually ventricular fibrillation. Sudden cardiac death in the young is rare but remains a source of concern. A careful screening history and physical examination, especially for potential athletes, should identify the majority of young people at risk.
