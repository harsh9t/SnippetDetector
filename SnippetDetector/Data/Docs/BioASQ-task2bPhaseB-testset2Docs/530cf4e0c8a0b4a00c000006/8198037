<abstract>
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is probably the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in youthful athletes, and this diagnosis has represented a contraindication to continued participation in competitive sports. Less well appreciated is the fact that within the clinical spectrum of HC are patients who, despite having this disease, have been able to undertake particularly intensive and often extraordinary levels of training for sports competition over many years without dying suddenly. Fourteen such patients (13 men and 1 woman, aged 30 to 66 years [mean 43]) form the present study group. HC was initially identified at 24 to 57 years of age (mean 34), usually under fortuitous circumstances. Patients most often competed in distance running (including the marathon, 7), but also in swimming, triathalon, basketball, and football. The duration of training ranged from 6 to 22 years (mean 15) and 5 continue to train and compete actively. The magnitude of training, competition, and achievement was considerable in most patients; 12 of the 14 performed either at the national, collegiate or professional level in their sport, completed numerous marathon and triathalon events, or sustained particularly rigorous training regimens of > or = 50 miles/week. Echocardiographic studies demonstrated a left ventricular wall thickness of 18 to 28 mm (mean 20) in most patients (12 of 14) having a relatively localized pattern of ventricular septal hypertrophy. It is possible for some patients with HC to tolerate particularly intense athletic training and competition for many years, and even maintain high levels of achievement without incurring symptoms and disease progression or dying suddenly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
