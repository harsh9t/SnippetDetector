Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common inherited primary cardiac disorders and the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. With advances in technology, it is now recognized that HCM affects individuals of all ages. Many patients with HCM will have a benign course with few symptoms. Some patients, however, possess risk factors that greatly increase the likelihood of sudden death if their disease remains undiagnosed. Therefore, it is imperative that emergency physicians be familiar with the symptoms and typical electrocardiogram manifestations of HCM. Three illustrative cases are presented with a review of the disease.
