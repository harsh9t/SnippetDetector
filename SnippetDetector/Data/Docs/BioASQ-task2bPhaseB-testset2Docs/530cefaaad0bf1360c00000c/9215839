PURPOSE: T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive malignancy of mature T cells refractory to conventional chemotherapy, with a median survival duration of 7.5 months. We report here promising results with the use of a genetically reshaped human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with T-PLL, most of whom had received the purine analog deoxycoformycin (DCF), were treated with CAMPATH-1H. Results were compared with those of 25 patients treated with DCF. RESULTS: Major responses occurred in 11 patients (73%) treated with CAMPATH-1H compared with 40% with DCF. Complete remissions (CRs) were documented in nine (60%) of the CAMPATH-1H cases and only three (12%) were obtained with DCF. CRs with CAMPATH-1H were durable, and re-treatment with the antibody resulted in second CRs in three relapsed patients. Two of them were successfully autografted with peripheral-blood and bone marrow stem cells collected during the first CR. Apart from first-dose reactions, infusions of CAMPATH-1H were well tolerated. However, two responding patients developed severe bone marrow aplasia that was fatal in one; the second remained moderately pancytopenic 21 weeks after stopping CAMPATH-1H therapy. The cause of this adverse effect is unknown. CONCLUSION: CAMPATH-1H is an effective agent in T-PLL and represents a significant improvement over other types of therapy. However, CAMPATH-1H alone is not sufficient for long-term remissions, and the role of autologous stem-cell transplantation needs further investigation.
