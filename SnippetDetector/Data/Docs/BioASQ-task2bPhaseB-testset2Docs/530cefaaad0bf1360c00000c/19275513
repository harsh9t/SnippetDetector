<abstract>
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is a rare post-thymic lymphoid disorder, which has distinctive clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features. It has previously been associated with an aggressive course, poor response to conventional chemotherapy and a short median survival. Treatment with purine analogs and the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab has resulted in significantly higher response rates and increased survival. However, responses are transient and allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor-cell transplantation remains the only potential curative option. The proportion of patients eligible for transplant is low, owing to the older age group of patients, and nonmyeloablative transplantation is a promising alternative that needs to be explored.
