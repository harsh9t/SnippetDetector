The tumor suppressor gene DICE1 is located within a previously reported critical region of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 13q14.3. Expression of the remaining DICE1 allele is down-regulated in non-small cell lung carcinomas. Ectopic expression of DICE1 cDNA by DICE1-green fluorescent protein fusion constructs resulted in inhibition of colony formation of human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1 and NCI-H520 and prostate carcinoma cell line DU145. In IGF-IR transformed Balb/c 3T3, DICE1 substantially sup-pressed growth in soft agar. These results demonstrate that DICE1 has a growth-suppressing activity and interferes with anchorage-independent growth of IGF-IR transformed tumor cells dependent upon IGF-I signaling.
