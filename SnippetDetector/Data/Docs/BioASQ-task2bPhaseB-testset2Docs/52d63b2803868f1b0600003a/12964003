PC-SPES is an eight herbal mixture that was shown to have activity against prostate cancer. Recently, we purified oridonin from Rabdosia rubescens, one component of PC-SPES, by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The ability of oridonin to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells was examined by MTT assay. Oridonin effectively inhibited the proliferation of a wide variety of cancer cells including those from prostate (LNCaP, DU145, PC3), breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB231), non-small cell lung (NSCL) (NCI-H520, NCI-H460, NCI-H1299) cancers, acute promyelocytic leukemia (NB4), and glioblastoma multiforme (U118, U138) with ED50s ranging from 1.8 to 7.5 micro g/ml. TUNEL assay and cell cycle analysis showed that oridonin induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In addition, expression of p21waf1 was induced in LNCaP and NCI-H520 cells in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, when p53 was suppressed by over-expression of E6 from human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16), these cells lost their sensitivity to oridonin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Taken together, oridonin inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells via apoptosis and cell cycle arrest with p53 playing a central role in several cancer types which express the wild-type p53 gene. Oridonin may be a novel, adjunctive therapy for a large variety of malignancies and probably represents one of the major, active components of PC-SPES.
