Heptaplatin, cis-malonato [(4R,5R)-4,5-bis (amino-methyl)-2-isopropyl-1,3-dioxolane] platinum(II) (SKI-2053R, Sunpla) is a new platinum derivative with anti-tumor activity comparable to cisplatin on various cancer cell lines. Preclinical studies suggest that it is less nephrotoxic than cisplatin. This study was undertaken to examine the combined effect of heptaplatin and ionizing radiation on two established human squamous carcinoma cell lines (NCI-H520, SQ20B). The cytotoxic activity of heptaplatin was concentration-dependent in both cell lines. When low dose heptaplatin was combined with high dose ionizing radiation, there was an additive cytotoxic effect on NCI-H520 cells (P < 0.05), while a moderate dose of heptaplatin and a low dose of ionizing radiation had an additive cytotoxic effect on the growth of SQ20B cells (P < 0.05). FACS analysis and DAPI staining showed that their additive cytotoxic effects were correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Further studies are warranted using heptaplatin and ionizing radiation in squamous cell carcinoma as a substitute for cisplatin.
