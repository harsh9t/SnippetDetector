STUDY DESIGN: A case report and literature review is presented. OBJECTIVE: To review relevant data for the management of Bertolotti's syndrome and to determine whether the transverse process-ilium articulation may be a pain generator. BACKGROUND: Bertolotti's syndrome is associated with axial low back pain secondary to arthritic changes; the pain generator in the disorder is unclear. METHODS: We present a case report of symptomatic Bertolotti's syndrome managed with intra-articular steroid injections. RESULTS: A patient with Bertolotti's syndrome had significant relief of axial pain after steroid injection of the ilium-transverse process articulation. CONCLUSIONS: Steroid therapy may be a non-surgical alternative for the treatment of symptomatic Bertolotti's syndrome.
