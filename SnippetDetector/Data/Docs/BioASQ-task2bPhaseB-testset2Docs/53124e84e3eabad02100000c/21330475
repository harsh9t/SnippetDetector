The present study characterized platelet secretion and surface expression of proangiogenic stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and antiangiogenic PF4 and endostatin on activation. The angiogenic factors presented in randomly distributed granules in resting platelets, which were peripherized on activation. Confocal and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that SDF-1α/CXCL12 and PF4/CXCL4 mostly present in different granules. Platelet activation induced marked SDF-1α and endostatin but mild PF4 or no VEGF surface expression. PAR1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP), adenosine diphosphate (via P2Y1/P2Y12), and glycoprotein VI-targeting collagen-related peptide induced massive SDF-1α and VEGF but modest PF4 or no endostatin release. In contrast, PAR4-AP triggered marked PF4 and sole endostatin release but limited SDF-1α or VEGF secretion. Distinct platelet release of SDF-1α and endostatin involved different engagements of intracellular signaling pathways. In conclusion, different platelet stimuli evoke distinct secretion and surface expression of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. PAR1, adenosine diphosphate, and glycoprotein VI stimulation favors proangiogenic, whereas PAR4 promotes antiangiogenic, factor release.
