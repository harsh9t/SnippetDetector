Given the multifaceted role of Ras in tumor angiogenesis, pharmacologic targeting of such proteins may bring about at least three important consequences: (1) partial obliteration of the angiogenic competence of tumor cells, (2) an increase in vascular dependence and sensitization to apoptosis, and (3) a direct inhibition of endothelial cell responses to proangiogenic stimuli. Exploration of some of these possibilities, using various pharmacological compounds and antibodies, has already begun. An intriguing possibility is that Ras antagonists and signal transduction inhibitors may synergize with a number of other antiangiogenic modalities such as direct acting antiangiogenic agents (e.g., endostatin) or antivascular regimens involving low-dose continuous chemotherapy as a vasculature-targeting strategy.
