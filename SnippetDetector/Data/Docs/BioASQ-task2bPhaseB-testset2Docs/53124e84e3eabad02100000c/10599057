Angiogenesis, which is the development of new vessels arising from the preestablished arborization, plays a fundamental role in tumor growth. Angiogenesis is the combination of antagonistic factors: proangiogenesis and antiangiogenesis factors. On the basis of the concept of relationship between angiogenesis and tumor growth, a promising new way of research is developing with the aim to control angiogenesis with an antitumor goal. The results of the preclinical trials point out the potential of antiangiogenesis agents in the fight against cancer. So, it was showed that tumor growth in animal models of syngenic or human tumors is inhibited by inhibitors of proangiogenic factors (like VEGF or FGF antibody ...) or by antiangiogenic factors. Endostatin, which is a natural inhibitor of angiogenesis, seems to be the most powerful molecule, able to achieve total and final regression of preestablished tumors. However, there are only preliminary data. Clinical trials are on the way. They should bring some answers concerning the place of these antiangiogenesis agents in the traditional therapeutic strategy. In neurooncology, just like in general cancerology, clinical trials have began with different molecules like Marismastat or Thalidomid. A review of the principal actors, preclinical and clinical trials in progress is presented.
