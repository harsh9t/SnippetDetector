Angiogenesis seems to be important both in the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and for the susceptibility of AML blasts to chemotherapy. Recent clinical studies even suggest that antiangiogenic therapy can induce disease control in patients with AML relapse. In this context we have investigated the profile of the systemic component of angiogenic regulation in AML by characterizing the serum levels of (i) the angiogenic regulators angiogenin, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and endostatin; (ii) the endothelial cell marker soluble (s) E-selectin. Patients with untreated AML had increased levels of angiogenin, endostatin and sE-selectin, whereas the levels of bFGF were not significantly altered. The systemic levels of the proangiogenic bFGF, the antiangiogenic endostatin and the endothelial cell marker sE-selectin showed significant correlations, whereas angiogenin and sE-selectin levels were not correlated. Furthermore, intensive chemotherapy resulted in decreased systemic levels of the 2 proangiogenic mediators angiogenin and bFGF, whereas endostatin levels remained high after treatment. Although angiogenin normally is a part of the acute phase reaction, its systemic levels were not altered when patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia developed complicating bacterial infections. Our results suggest that intensive chemotherapy can modulate the systemic component of angiogenic regulation in AML patients.
