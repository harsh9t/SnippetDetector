Burning mouth syndrome is a challenging condition in terms of both diagnosis and management. These challenges lead to frustration for patients and difficulties for dental practitioners. Unfortunately, delays are common between initial presentation and definitive diagnosis, and also between diagnosis and appropriate management. Furthermore, interventions are often undertaken without a working diagnosis, knowledge of the underlying condition or knowledge of best management strategies for this form of chronic orofacial pain. This article discusses potential reasons for diagnostic delays. It also presents current strategies for managing burning mouth syndrome, to assist the dental practitioner in making prudent therapeutic choices.
