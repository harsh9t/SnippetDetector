Clinical characteristics and treatment responses were studied in 130 patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Most patients were postmenopausal women, and the tongue was the most frequently afflicted site. Although 39% of the patients complained of dry mouth, no causative factors were evident. Therefore BMS is assumed to be a functional disorder. This was at least partially confirmed because the most effective management was in response to mood-altering drugs. From our data BMS appears to be a chronic condition with variations in symptoms among patients and without a predictable endpoint.
