Thirty-three patients complaining of a burning mouth were investigated for deficiencies which might cause the symptoms. No deficiencies could be demonstrated. They were also questioned on their state of mind in the preceding period and their daily intake of medicine. More than half described their state of mind as normal. Benzodiazepines was the drug group used most. A treatment protocol for these patients is described.
