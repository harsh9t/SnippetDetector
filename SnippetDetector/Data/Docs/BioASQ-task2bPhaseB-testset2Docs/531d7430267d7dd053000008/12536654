OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of livial on postmenopause women with burning mouth syndrome. METHODS: Fifty six postmenopause women with burning mouth syndrome were randomly divided into two groups, 26 patients were treated with livial as the treatment group, 30 patients were treated with oryzanol and vitamin E as the control. To evaluate the effect, all the patients were observed in 3-6 months after therapy. RESULTS: The result showed that the total effective rate of the treatment group was 84.62% after 3 months, 88.46% after 6 months, and significantly higher than that in the control(P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: It is indicated that livial is safer and more effective than nylestriol in treatment with burning mouth syndrome.
