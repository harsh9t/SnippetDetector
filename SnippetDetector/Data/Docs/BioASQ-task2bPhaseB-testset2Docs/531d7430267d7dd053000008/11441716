<abstract>
Symptoms of a burning sensation of the oral mucosa mainly occur in the elderly, more often in women than in men. Often accompanying symptoms are complaints of a dry mouth and taste disturbances, all together referred to as the burning mouth syndrome. In the majority of cases there is no detectable cause. Although a psychogenic aetiology has often been put forward, no scientific evidence has ever been provided on this matter. In the majority of patients the burning mouth syndrome will disappear spontaneously, although this may take many years.
