Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by oral dysesthesia, xerostomia and dysgeusia without visible alterations of oral mucosa. While secondary BMS results from an underlying general condition such as diabetes or iron deficiency, no causal disorder can be identified in primary BMS. The estimated prevalence is 1 - 2%, postmenopausal women are substantially more frequently affected than men. Current etiologic concepts assume a focal peripheral and central neuropathy. Only few controlled drug trials have yet been conducted. Thioctic acid appears the medical treatment of choice due to its comparatively good evidence for efficacy and low incidence of adverse reaction. Gabapentin and pregabalin are modern GABA-analogue anticonvulsants, which are also efficient in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies. Also conceptually appropriate for BMS treatment, current evidence for efficacy in BMS is insufficient. In two trials, local oral treatment with clonazepam has been beneficial in BMS. The efficacy of antidepressants is equivocal.
