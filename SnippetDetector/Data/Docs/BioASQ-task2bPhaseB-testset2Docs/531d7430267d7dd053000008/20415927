BACKGROUND: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by a spontaneous burning pain in the oral mucosa without known organic cause or standardized treatment. The aims of this study were to assess and compare the efficacy of clonazepam and diazepam in relieving the symptoms associated with BMS and evaluate for which patients this treatment might be effective by correlating treatment efficacy with underlying psychological status. METHODS: The medical records of BMS patients attending an oral medicine private practice (1999-2004) were reviewed. The patients were then contacted and asked to complete a short questionnaire regarding their response to diazepam/clonazepam drug therapies. A second group of patients attending the above clinic (n = 30) were asked to fill out a hospital anxiety and depression assessment form in an attempt to correlate treatment success with underlying psychological status. RESULTS: A total of 71.4 per cent of patients treated with clonazepam had partial or complete resolution of their oral symptoms, while 55.1 per cent of patients treated with diazepam had improvement of their oral symptoms. There was no correlation between underlying anxiety or depression and efficacy of benzodiazepine medication. CONCLUSIONS: A greater percentage of patients taking clonazepam reported either partial or complete relief of symptoms compared to diazepam. However, the differences were not statistically significant. There was no correlation found between underlying psychopathology and treatment success with benzodiazepines.
