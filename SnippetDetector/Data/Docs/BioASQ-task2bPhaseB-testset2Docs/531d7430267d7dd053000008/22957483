OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of aloe vera (AV) applied in combination with a tongue protector, comparing this with a placebo. METHODS: A total of 75 patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) were divided into three groups randomly: Group I (tongue protector three times a day), Group II (tongue protector and 0.5 ml AV at 70% three times a day) and Group III (tongue protector and 0.5 ml placebo three times a day). Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS), while patient psychological profiles were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety-Depression scale and their quality of life using the Oral Health Impact Profile 49 (OHIP-49). Treatment continued for 3 months. RESULTS: Visual analogue scale pain values improved for all three study groups but without statistically significant differences between the groups (P = 0.210). Regarding quality of life, no significant differences were found between groups with the exception of the OHIP-49 score for handicap. The overall clinical improvement was greater for Group II, with a difference almost reaching significance. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant prescription of tongue protector and AV is effective for treating patients with BMS.
