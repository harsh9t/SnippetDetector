AIM: This paper evaluated the efficacy of the systemic administration of levosulpiride, an antipsychotic and antidepressant drug, in the management of burning mouth syndrome. METHODS: Forty-four subjects suffering from idiopathic burning mouth syndrome were enrolled in the study. Patients underwent a thorough clinical examination, including salivary flow rate measurements, laboratory tests (complete blood cell counts, blood glucose levels, serum iron and transferrin levels, serum vitamin B(12), and folate levels), patch tests for contact allergy to denture materials, and isolation of Candida species from oral mucosal scrapes. Oral symptoms before and after treatment were assessed using a visual analogue scale. All the patients used systemic levosulpiride (100 mg/daily) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 39 patients who completed the protocol, none reported complete remission of the oral burning sensation. However, 28 patients reported at least some improvement, and these patients had had oral symptoms for significantly less time than those who reported no improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that levosulpiride is more effective in patients who have recently developed burning/stinging oral sensation.
