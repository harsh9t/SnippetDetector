Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a difficult disease for patients and clinicians. Moreover, there is not a general consensus on how to treat the disease. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate BMS patients' response to topical clonazepam treatment. A double blind study was performed. Among a total of 66 patients, 33 were treated with tablets of clonazepam and another 33 were treated with a placebo. Symptoms were evaluated after 1 month and 6 months of treatment and scored on an analogical scale from 0 to 10. Among the 33 patients treated with clonazepam, 23 showed at least a 50% reduction in symptoms after 1 month of treatment. On the contrary, only 4 in the placebo group exhibited significant improvement. After 6 months, significant differences were observed again, as 23 of the 33 patients treated with the drug reported at least a 50% reduction in symptoms, whereas only 2 among those treated with the placebo significantly improved. However, when measured in terms of a complete cure (lack of symptoms), the differences were not significant: 5 drug-treated patients and one belonging to the placebo group were asymptomatic after one month of treatment. In summary, it seems that clonazepam applied topically was effective in treating BMS in a large proportion of patients.
