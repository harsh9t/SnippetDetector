The aim of the study was to determine, in a group of patients with therapy-resistant burning mouth syndrome (BMS), the possible deficiency of vitamins B1, B2, and B6 and the effect of proper vitamin replacement therapy. Sixteen individuals, aged 47 to 81 years, participated in the study. All underwent a base-line examination comprising anamnestic information, subjective assessment of symptoms, dietary registration, salivary analysis, and serum analysis of thiamine (B1), riboflavine (B2), and pyridoxine (B6). Fifteen individuals had low thiamine and/or riboflavine levels in accordance with suggested levels in the literature and were given replacement therapy. No effect on BMS of vitamin replacement therapy or placebo therapy could be demonstrated.
