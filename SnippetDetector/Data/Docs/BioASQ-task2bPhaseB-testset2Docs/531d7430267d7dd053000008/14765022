Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a frequent disease characterized by a burning or painful sensation in the tongue and/or other oral sites without clinical mucosal abnormalities or lesions. The etiopathology is unknown although local, systemic and psychological factors have been connected with BMS. As this syndrome is a multifactorial disease, the diagnostic and therapeutic approach should be multidisciplinary. In this paper a review of the literature is presented and the most recent advancement on clinical, etiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of BMS are discussed.
