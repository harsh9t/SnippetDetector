Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as a chronic pain condition, characterized symptomatically by a generalized or localized burning sensation in the oral cavity. Various drugs have been used in attempting to treat BMS, but there is insufficient evidence to show the effect of any effective treatment. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of therapies for BMS. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients with a diagnosis of BMS were identified by searching Pubmed and Scoppus databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed on the basis of the method of allocation concealment, blindness of the study, loss of participants, size sample, and outcome concealment. A total of 12 relevant articles were analyzed. Therapies that used capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and clonazepam were those that showed more reduction in symptoms of BMS. However, many studies of therapeutic interventions in BMS lack consistency in their results, because they use in their methodology, sample and a relatively short time of therapy and often do not provide a follow-up of patients treated. Thus, future studies are required to establish the treatment for patients suffering from this chronic and painful syndrome.
