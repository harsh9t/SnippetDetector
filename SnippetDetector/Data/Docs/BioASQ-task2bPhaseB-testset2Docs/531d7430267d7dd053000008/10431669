Burning mouth syndrome is a complicated, poorly understood, predominantly oral condition that affects more than 1 million people in the United States. Women are particularly affected by the condition; they are diagnosed with symptoms seven times more frequently than males. Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning, painful sensation of the oral mucosa that most commonly involves the anterior tongue. Many precipitating factors to burning mouth syndrome have been proposed, and treatment addressing these factors has had limited success. Patients with burning mouth syndrome are more likely to be evaluated by physicians, and therefore it is advantageous for the physician to be familiar with this oral condition. This paper reviews burning mouth syndrome, associated causative factors, and treatment strategies for the physician.
