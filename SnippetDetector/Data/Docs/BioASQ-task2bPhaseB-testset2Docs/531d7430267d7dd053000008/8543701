The burning mouth syndrome is characterized by burning and painful sensations of the mouth in the absence of significant mucosal abnormalities. For patients in whom no causative factor can be identified, empiric antifungal, nutritional, and estrogen replacement therapy can be initiated. If these fail, long-term therapy with antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and clonazepam can be considered. Topical capsaicin and laser therapy have been reported beneficial in a few patients.
