<abstract>
A recent index of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) was applied to 74 patients with burning mouth syndrome. The scale pointed to anxiety, more than depression, being a feature of burning mouth syndrome. The validity and clinical application of this scale to assess anxiety and depression in such patients are discussed.
