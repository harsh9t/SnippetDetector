Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is an oral dysesthesia presenting as a burning sensation of the tongue and other oral and perioral mucosae. A painful symptomatology in different bodily regions (extraoral) may also be a common feature in patient with BMS. The management of BMS is challenging and there is no clear guideline for the management of idiopathic BMS. Herein, we describe a group of patients (5 patients) in whom symptoms of BMS responded to levodopa. In parallel, four patients fulfilled the criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS). Family history of RLS was positive in two patients. We reviewed the literature and noted a marked overlap between BMS and RLS. Overlaps were noted in epidemiological profiles, pattern of clinical features and even in neurophysiological observations (alterations in the striatal dopaminergic system). We suggest that a subset of patients with BMS may be a phenotypic variant of RLS and a trial of dopaminergic drugs should be given in patients with BMS who has a history suggestive of RLS or in a patient who do not show a response to usual therapies for BMS.
