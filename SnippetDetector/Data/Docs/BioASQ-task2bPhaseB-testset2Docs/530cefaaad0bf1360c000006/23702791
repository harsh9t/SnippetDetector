BACKGROUND: Several external and internal risk factors for cerebral aneurysm rupture have been identified to date. Recently, it has been reported that moon phases correlate with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), however, another author found no such association. Therefore, the present study investigates the influence of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal rupture, the initial clinical presentation, and the amount of subarachnoid blood. METHODS: Lunar phase and the particular day of the lunar cycle were correlated to the date of aneurysm rupture, aneurysm location, initial clinical presentation, and amount of subarachnoid blood assessed from CT scans of all patients treated for basal SAH in our department from 2003 to 2010. RESULTS: We found no correlation between incidence of aneurysmal SAH, location of the aneurysm, initial clinical presentation, or amount of subarachnoid blood and the lunar cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The moon influences neither the incidence of aneurysmal SAH nor the grade of initial neurological deterioration or amount of subarachnoid blood.
