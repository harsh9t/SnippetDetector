OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhages. METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients admitted to the department of neurosurgery during 1992 and 2004 suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. The onset of bleeding was compared with the lunar phase. RESULTS: We did not observe any significant impact of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in 717 consecutive patients (p=0.84). CONCLUSION: The impact of the lunar cycle on aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is a myth rather than reality.
