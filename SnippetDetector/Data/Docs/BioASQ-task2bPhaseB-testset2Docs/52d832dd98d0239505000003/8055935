The major phosphorylation site for both casein kinase-2 (CK2) and casein kinase-1 (CK1) in protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) inhibitor-2 (I-2) is Ser86. Minor phosphorylation sites affected by either CK2 or CK1 are Ser120/Ser121 and Ser174, respectively. A synthetic peptide of 25 amino acids encompassing residues 67-93 of I-2 is phosphorylated by either CK2 or CK1 at its seryl residue corresponding to Ser86 with higher Vmax and Km values similar to those of the intact protein (9 vs 7.2 microM and 14.2 vs 5.3 microM with CK2 and CK1, respectively). No detectable phosphorylation of this peptide which also includes the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) site (Thr72), could be observed with either GSK-3 or p34cdc2 kinase whether or not its seryl residue equivalent to Ser86 had been previously phosphorylated by CK2. Shorter derivatives of I-2(67-93), encompassing residues 72-93 and 78-93, are also readily phosphorylated by both CK1 and CK2, with phosphorylation efficiencies similar to those of the parent peptide. A synthetic heptadecapeptide reproducing the phosphoacceptor site around Ser120/Ser121 is phosphorylated by CK2, but not to any detectable extent by CK1, with a Km value fivefold higher than that of the corresponding pentadecapeptide including Ser86 (78-93). A synthetic pentadecapeptide (166-180) reproducing the phosphoacceptor site around Ser174 is phosphorylated by CK1 less efficiently than the pentadecapeptide including its main phosphorylation site (78-93) (Km 280 microM vs 33 microM). This peptide is readily phosphorylated by CK2 as well, although it lacks the canonical consensus sequence for CK2 and its Ser174 is almost unaffected by CK2 in intact I-2. These data provide the clear-cut demonstration that the consensus sequence with N-terminal prephosphorylated residue(s), SerP/ThrP-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr, [Flotow, H., Graves, P. R., Wang, A., Fiol, C. J., Roeske, R. W. & Roach, P. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14264-14269; Meggio, F., Perich, J. W., Reynolds, E. C. & Pinna, L. A. (1991) FEBS Lett. 283, 303-306] is not always required to achieve efficient and high-affinity phosphorylation by CK1. They also show that the specificity determinants for I-2 phosphorylation by either CK2 or CK1, but not by GSK3, are entirely grounded on local structural features of the phosphoacceptor site, being only marginally affected by the overall structure of I-2.
