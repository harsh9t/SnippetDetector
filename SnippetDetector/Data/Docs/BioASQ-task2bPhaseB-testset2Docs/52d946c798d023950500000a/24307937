Macromolecules gain access to the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells using one of several ways of which clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the most researched. Although the mechanism of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is well understood in general, novel adaptor proteins that play various roles in ensuring specific regulation of the mentioned process are being discovered all the time. This review provides a detailed account of the mechanism of clathrin-mediated internalization of activated G protein-coupled receptors, as well as a description of the major proteins involved in this process.

majority of cases, the internalized receptor remains accessible to the
molecules of the intracellular signaling cascade and, therefore, can continue

receptors depends on whether the activation was of a short-term nature or was a
prolonged type of activation/reactivation [10]. hus, for instance, the ²2- adrenergic receptor following
short-term activation by an agonist recycles back primarily to the cytoplasmic
membrane; however, upon prolonged activation it can be transferred to the
lysosome for degradation, thereby reducing the number of receptors on the
surface of the membrane (down-regulation) [10].

ecycling to the cytoplasmic membrane can occur via a rapid pathway through
ab4-containing endosomes, and via a slow pathway through ab11-containing
recycling endosomes [11]. t is believed
that late endosomes contain receptors intended for degradation. ransition from
early to late endosomes is accompanied by the replacement of protein ab5 with
protein ab7 β€“ the so-called β€�ab conversionβ€� [12].ENDOCYTOSIS OF G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS AS
AN EXAMPLE OF CLATHRIN-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS


The superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR ) is considered to be the
largest family of membrane proteins involved in intracellular signal
transduction [1]. The general structural
feature of GPCR is the presence of seven Ξ±-helical transmembrane hydrophobic
segments each consisting of 25β€“35 amino acid residues [2]. The N-terminal portion of GPCR and three loops between the
transmembrane segments are found outside the cell, and the C-terminal part and
the other three loops are found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.


The ligands of various GPCR include ions, organic odorants, amines, peptides,
proteins, lipids, nucleotides, and photons. Activation of the receptors by
their corresponding ligands leads to the formation of complexes consisting of
receptors and heterotrimeric G-proteins (consisting of 3 subunits) and the
associated exchange of GDP for GTP. This exchange causes the dissociation of a
G-protein into a GTP-bound Ξ±-subunit and a complex consisting of Ξ²- and
Ξ³-subunits, as well as the dissociation of all three subunits of the G-protein
from the receptor. It is now proven that both the Ξ±-subunit and the Ξ²Ξ³ complex
serve as signal transducers by activating or inhibiting enzymes and ion
channels [3]. Bound GTP is hydrolyzed
following interaction with the effector and re-association of the Ξ±-subunit and
Ξ²Ξ³ to form a complex consisting of three subunits with a bound GDP. This
complex is again able to interact with the activated receptor [4].


Binding of the ligand to the receptor leads to conformational changes that give
rise to the G-protein-mediated signal transduction and conversion of the
receptor into the protein kinase GRK substrate (G-protein-coupled Receptor
Kinases). The serine or threonine residues of the ligand-activated receptor
located in the cytoplasmic domain and/or in the third cytoplasmic loop are
phosphorylated. Then, Ξ²-arrestins bind to the activated and phosphorylated
receptor [5]. Ξ²-Arrestins play a
significant role in the process of internalization of GPCR as their binding
leads to clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the receptor attributed to
interaction with the components of the endocytotic mechanism β€“ clathrin and the
AP-2 adaptor protein complex [6, 7].


Newly formed clathrin-coated vesicles containing the receptor detach from the
cytoplasmic membrane by means of the protein called dynamin tightening the neck
of the forming vesicles [8]. The
internalized receptor- ligand complex detached as part of the vesicles further
undergoes intracellular transport. The first stage of this pathway is the
formation of early endosomes. It is believed that canonical early endosomes
contain a small GTPase Rab5 and the early endosome antigen 1 (EE A1). In the
majority of cases, the internalized receptor remains accessible to the
molecules of the intracellular signaling cascade and, therefore, can continue
to participate in the signal transduction as if it was localized on the surface
of the membrane [9]. Then, depending on
the type of the receptor, one of two scenarios is possible. The receptor either
dissociates from the bound ligand and is recycled back to the cell surface
(re-sensitization) or is transferred to late endosomes and is subjected to
degradation within lysosomes (Fig. 1). The fate of specific
receptors depends on whether the activation was of a short-term nature or was a
prolonged type of activation/reactivation [10]. Thus, for instance, the Ξ²2- adrenergic receptor following
short-term activation by an agonist recycles back primarily to the cytoplasmic
membrane; however, upon prolonged activation it can be transferred to the
lysosome for degradation, thereby reducing the number of receptors on the
surface of the membrane (down-regulation) [10].

Recycling to the cytoplasmic membrane can occur via a rapid pathway through
Rab4-containing endosomes, and via a slow pathway through Rab11-containing
recycling endosomes [11]. It is believed
that late endosomes contain receptors intended for degradation. Transition from
early to late endosomes is accompanied by the replacement of protein Rab5 with
protein Rab7 β€“ the so-called β€�Rab conversionβ€� [12].

lathrin-coated vesicles have a three-layered structure: the outer layer is
formed by clathrin (clathrin lattice), the internal layer is a lipid membrane
with protein inclusions, while adaptor proteins are found in between. he
adaptor protein complexes interact directly with the lipid bilayer, and
clathrin in turn binds to the adaptors [13].


t is presumed that endocytosis begins with the formation of pits on the inner
surface of the cytoplasmic membrane containing clathrin, the -2 adaptor
protein complex, and accessory proteins [14]. he subunits of the adaptor complex trigger the formation
of the clathrin lattice at specific sites of the cytoplasmic membrane and
mediate the interaction between clathrin and the cargo protein [15]. -2 plays an important role in selecting
the target for endocytosis by binding either directly to a transmembrane cargo
protein containing the necessary sequences or via helper proteins, such as
²-arrestins [16]. inding of -2 to the
membrane is a two-stage process. irst the ±-subunit of -2 binds weakly to
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (td. Ins(4,5)P2). AP-2 affinity for the
corresponding endocytic motifs increases upon phosphorylation of a threonine
residue in the ΞΌ2-subunit of AP-2 [17]
by adaptor-associated kinase, AAK1 [18,
19]. This phosphorylation enables the
ΞΌ2-subunit to bind to motifs of the cargo protein undergoing endocytosis and to
PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane creating the foundation for the formation of a
clathrin-coated vesicle. Then, the adaptor complex can bind to the other
accessory proteins, such as CALM, required for the formation of a clathrin
lattice. Removal of this protein from the cell leads to the formation of large
asymmetric clathrincoated pits [20].
Simultaneously with the polymerization of clathrin, the process involves a
variety of other proteins required for the control of the invagination of the
cytoplasmic membrane and the formation of the pit on it. It is believed that
the bending of the membrane is attributed to the action of several proteins
containing BAR-domains (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) [21], such as amphiphysin [22] and endophilin [23]. The protein epsin is also able to stimulate the bending
of the membrane [24]. Polymerizing
clathrin forms the lattice (consisting of hexagons and pentagons) surrounding
the emerging pits and, thus, stabilizes the membrane curvature [25].


Subsequent deformation of the membrane and polymerization of clathrin lead to
the clathrin-coated vesicle remaining attached to the main part of the membrane
via a narrow neck requiring GTPase dynamin for the completion of the detachment
of the vesicle. Amphiphysin already being a part of the vesicle contains
binding sites for both clathrin and dynamin. It is presumed that it β€�attractsβ€�
dynamin to the forming vesicle and facilitates its oligomerization [26]. According to the two proposed models,
after polymerization of dynamin around the neck of the vesicle, a GTP
hydrolysis-dependent change in its structure results in the constriction (first
model) or stretching (second model) of the neck and detachment of the vesicle
from the remainder of the membrane [27].


Removal of the clathrin coat from the surface of the vesicle is necessary for
further fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane and delivery of
endocytosed β€�cargoβ€� to the target destination. The primary participants in the
process of depolymerization of the clathrin coat include the proteins Hsc70 and
auxilin. Auxilin, an homologue of Hsp40, binds to clathrin and attracts Hsc70,
which interacts with its J-domain. As a result of interaction with auxilin, the
ATPase activity of Hsc70 increases and it binds to clathrin with increased
affinity, thus distorting the conformation and contributing to the dismantling
of the clathrin lattice into individual molecules [28, 29]. The layer
formed by the adaptor complex is removed as a result of dephosphorylation of
the AP-proteins by phosphatases, as it was shown for the ΞΌ1-subunit of the AP-1
[30]. The proteins synaptojanin and
endophilin dephosphorylate membrane phospholipids, thereby reducing the
affinity of the adaptors for vesicles [31].

-protein-coupled receptor kinases and ²-arrestins


 large number of proteins that are capable of direct interactions with the
 have been described [32]. owever,
only two classes of proteins, other than -proteins, that specifically interact
with ligand-activated receptors are known:  kinases () and ²-arrestins
[33].


he  family comprises products of seven different genes. he expression of
1 and -7 is limited to retinal rods and cones, respectively. 4 is
exclusively expressed in the cerebellum, testis and kidneys. 2, -3, -5 and
-6, in contrast, are expressed in vari ous mammalian tissues. even kinases are
divided into three subfamilies with respect to amino acid sequence homology.
1 and -7; 2 and -3 contain pleckstrin homology () domain, and
association of these kinases with plasma membranes is dependent on the
interaction with the ²³-subunit of the -proteins and
td. Ins(4,5)P2; GRK4β€“6 proteins are continuously associated with the membrane
[34].


Arrestins comprise 4 proteins. Arrestins 1 and 4 (x-arrestin) are expressed in
retinal rods and cones, respectively. Arrestins 2 and 3 (also known as
Ξ²-arrestins 1 and 2) are present in all tissues [5]. GRK and arrestins control GPCR activity at three levels:
(1) silencing β€“ functional detachment of the receptor from its G-protein; (2)
regulation of transport β€“ removal of the receptor from the cytoplasmic membrane
(internalization), recycling back to the membrane and/or degradation; and (3)
signal transduction β€“ activation or inhibition of the intracellular signaling
pathways independent of G-proteins. The N-terminal portion of arrestin 1 [35] and arrestins 2 and 3 [36, 37]
contains the regions responsible for the recognition of agonist-activated
phosphorylated GPCR . According to the proposed model, the charged phosphate
groups of the receptor destroy the polar core of the arrestin resulting in the
release of its C-terminal part, which is responsible for binding to the
proteins involved in endocytosis β€“ clathrin and AP-2 [38].


Clathrin


The major protein of clathrin-coated vesicles isolated by Pierce [39] was named clathrin as it was characterized
by an ability to form structures with an ordered lattice, or β€�clathrates.β€� The
clathrin molecule resembles a triskelion (derived from Greek. Ο„Ο�ΞΉΟƒΞΊΞµΞ»Ξ·Ο‚β€“
three-legged β€“ a symbolic mark resembling three running legs that extend from
one point) and consists of three heavy and three light chains [40] (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Clathrin molecule (triskelion). Segments of the clathrin heavy chain are
indicated. The terminal domain is the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal
domains are localized in the center of the molecule. The position of the light
chains is shown schematically. Figure adapted from [40]

A clathrin heavy chain (HC) isolated from a ratβ€™s brain is composed of 1,675
amino acid residues and has a molecular weight slightly exceeding 191 kDa
(approximately 180 kDa as determined by denaturing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)). The amino acid sequences of the clathrin heavy
chain isolated from the brain of a human, rat or bovine are highly conserved (~
99%) [41]. Clathrin heavy chains have
also been isolated from the clathrin-coated vesicles of yeast [42] and plants [43].


Each clathrin heavy chain is in a complex with one of the light chains,
LCa or LCb, encoded by different genes. The amino acid
sequences of the light chains are highly conserved across different species
(95-98%). The electrophoretic mobility of light chains consisting of 230β€“250
amino acid residues in the SDS-PAGE corresponds to a molecular weight of
approximately 30β€“40 kDa. Three domains are identified in the light chain: the
conserved C-terminal, the central Ξ±-helical, and the acidic N-terminal. The
homology of both chains at the amino acid sequence level reaches 60% [41]. The region consisting of 22 amino acid
residues located at the N-terminus, the clathrin heavy chain binding site, the
cysteine residues near the C-terminal portion, and the serine residues enriched
casein kinase II phosphorylation site of the light chain LCb are
highly conserved [44]. Light chains bind
the proximal domains of the clathrin heavy chains [45]; primary binding is provided by the amino acid residues
1267β€“1522 of the heavy chain, the residues 93β€“160 of the light chain
LCa, and the residues 90β€“157 of the LCb [46].


The regions that are necessary for the trimerization of heavy chains, binding
of light chains, and formation of the clathrin lattice are located at the
intersection of clathrin heavy chains [47, 48]. The domain
that ensures the trimerization of heavy chains is localized between the amino
acid residues 1488 and 1587.


Two sites for the binding of clathrin to adaptor proteins are located in the
N-terminal domain. The first site interacts with peptides containing the
β€�clathrin boxβ€� (LOXO[D/E], where O is a large hydrophobic amino acid). Examples
of proteins containing such a motif include Ξ²-adaptins (the LLNLD sequence is
found in Ξ²-adaptins 1 and 2, the LLDLD sequence is found in Ξ²-adaptin 3),
Ξ²-arrestins 1 (LIELD) and 2 (LIEFE) and amphiphysins 1 and 2 (LLDLD) [49]. The second site binds proteins containing
the W-box motif (PWXXW, where X is any amino acid); e.g., the molecules of the
aforementioned amphiphysins 1 and 2 [50].


Clathrin molecules spontaneously self-assemble in weakly acidic
Ca2+-containing buffers with a low ionic strength to form a
heterogeneous population of closed polyhedral structures resembling a lattice
[51, 52]. The vertex of each triskelion is located at the vertex of
the lattice. The heavy chain legs and associated light chains extend outwardly
from the vertices forming the edges of the lattice (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Hexagonal clathrin barrel model (7.9Γ… resolution). Only the heavy chains of
clathrin are indicated. Figure adapted from [40]

All heavy chains form the two adjacent edges of a polyhedral lattice. The legs
appear to interact via their proximal and distal domains. Each edge consists of
two antiparallel proximal domains located above two antiparallel distal domains
[53]. The fragments of clathrin obtained
by expression in a heterologous system and consisting of a proximal domain and
a region necessary for trimerization are able to self-assemble into trimers but
cannot form lattices. Formation of the clathrin lattice requires distal domains
that are correctly oriented by binding of the terminal domains to adaptor
proteins [54]. Terminal domains in the
lattice are directed inwardly towards the center and are located under the
vertex, which is positioned at a distance of two vertices from the center of
the triskelion. Here, the terminal domains assume the shape of
hooks-projections providing a points of contact with the inner layer formed by
adaptor proteins [55].


It is worth mentioning that clathrin is also involved in mitosis. It is
presumed that it is necessary for the stabilization of the microtubules that
attach to kinetochores (called K-fibers) [56].


AP adaptor protein complexes


The second major protein of clathrin-coated vesicles is the adaptor protein
complex. Its discovery was made possible by its ability to stimulate the
assembly of the clathrin lattice under physiological conditions [57]. At least two adaptor complexes β€“ AP-1 and
AP-2 β€“ have been extensively researched. These complexes have structural
similarities and are composed of two different subunits of high molecular
weight ~ 100 kDa (typically called adaptins), two subunits of medium size
(47β€“50 kDa), and two low-molecular-weight subunits (17β€“19 kDa). The AP-2
complex comprises the following subunits: Ξ± and Ξ²2 (or Ξ²) adaptins, the ΞΌ2
subunit (50 kDa) or AP50 and the Οƒ2 subunit (17 kDa) or AP17. The AP-1 complex
comprises Ξ³ and Ξ²1 (or Ξ²β€™) adaptins, AP47 (or ΞΌ1) and AP19 (or Οƒ1) [58].


The designation that uses the same letters of the Greek alphabet reflects the
structural and presumably functional similarity of the subunits of the AP-1 and
AP-2 complexes [59, 60]. Ξ±- and Ξ³-adaptins differ most
significantly (~ 30% amino acid sequence homology), while the ΞΌ- and Οƒ-subunits
of the AP-1 complex exhibit high levels (~ 50%) of homology to the
corresponding ΞΌ- and Οƒ-subunits of the AP-2 complex, and Ξ²1- and Ξ²2-adaptins
are highly homologous (> 90%). AP-3 and AP-4 complexes that are similar in
subunit composition have also been identified: Ξ΄ and Ξ²3, ΞΌ3, Οƒ3 β€“ in the AP-3
complex; Ξµ and Ξ²4, ΞΌ4, Οƒ4 β€“ in the AP-4 complex [61, 62].


The complex of subunits forms a structure resembling Mickey Mouseβ€™s head
(Fig. 4), where the center is formed by the ΞΌ and Ξ΄ subunits,
and the two β€�earsβ€� are composed of the C-terminal domains of the two large
subunits, Ξ± and Ξ², connected to the β€�headβ€� via a flexible neck [63].

Fig. 4
Schematic diagram of the AP complexes. All complexes consist of two large
subunits, one medium subunit, and a small subunit. Figure adapted from [63]

While the assembly of the clathrin lattice occurs on the membrane, it has been
established that clathrin itself has no affinity with lipids. It is therefore
considered that clathrin is attracted to the membrane by adaptor proteins
[64, 65].


AP-2 is the main protein adaptor found on the plasma membrane and is involved
in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles during endocytosis.
Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that AP-1, -3 and
-4 are localized in endosomes and the Golgi complex [66]. AP-1 mediates the transport of proteins from the Golgi
complex to early or late endosomes.


AP-1 and AP-2 directly interact with the N-terminal domain of the clathrin
heavy chain via the clathrinbinding site in the Ξ²-chain. In 1998, cryoelectron
microscopy was utilized to elucidate the structure of the AP-2 complex with
clathrin [55]. It was established that
AP-2 forms a shell of continuous density in the center of the lattice. Based on
the images obtained, it was also concluded that AP-2 forms contacts with the
terminal domains of the clathrin lattice. Subsequently, an X-ray diffraction
analysis confirmed that the Ξ²-subunits of the AP-1, -2, and -3 containing the
clathrin-binding motif interact with the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy
chain [49].


In addition to clathrin, AP complexes interact with integral membrane proteins.
The YXXO sequence, located in the intracellular domains of many receptors, is
recognized by the ΞΌ-subunit of all AP-complexes [67]. [DE]XXXL[LI] motifs, which are also found in the
cytoplasmic domain of the receptors, bind to the Ξ²-subunits of the
AP-complexes, and these subunits exhibit different affinities to different
[DE]XXXL[LI] motifs. For instance, AP-1 and AP-2, but not AP-3, interact with
the DDQRDLI and NE QLPML sites [68]. The
DER APLI and EE KQPLL signals interact with AP-3, but not AP-1 or AP-2 [69].


Adaptor protein complexes are capable of binding to cell membrane lipids. Two
lipid binding sites have been described [70]. The first site is located in the N-terminal part of the
Ξ±-subunit of AP-2, and the second site is localized on the surface of the ΞΌ2
subunit [71]. Binding to the membrane is
determined by the interaction of the phosphates PtdIns(4,5)P2 and side chains
of the basic amino acid residues of the adaptor protein.


Auxilin


Auxilin is a multi-domain protein with a molecular weight of 100 kDa containing
a clathrin-binding domain, a J-domain, and a region homologous to
phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN (Fig. 5A) [72, 73]. The N-terminal domain binds to phosphoinositol
derivatives and PtdIns(4,5)P2 [74, 75]. The auxilin central domain interacts with
clathrin, the AP-2 complex [76], and
dynamin [77].

Fig. 5
Domain organization of auxilin and Hsc70. Numbers indicate the boundaries of
various domains. Figure adapted from [85]

Cryoelectron microscopy at a 20A resolution was utilized to obtain images of
full-sized auxilin [78] and its fragment
(549-910) [79] with a clathrin lattice.
Auxilin forms a shell of density within the lattice with points of contact with
the clathrin terminal domains. Auxilin is capable of interaction with the
terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain via the LLGLE motif comprising the
amino acid residues 496-500. It was established that the fragment containing
the J- and clathrin-binding domains of auxilin interacts with the two β€�anklesβ€�
of the clathrin heavy chain at their point of intersection and with the
subsequent terminal domain. Binding of auxilin to the clathrin lattice causes
the terminal domains to twist outwards, which is attributed to a change in the
position of the β€�ankle.β€� This change in the position of terminal domains causes
global changes throughout the entire lattice, increasing its diameter. It is
believed that auxilin attracts Hsc70 to these areas, which are important for
interaction within the lattice [55,
79].


Hsc70


Hsc70 is a constitutively expressed chaperone involved in many cellular
processes, including protein folding, degradation, and translocation. Another
interesting function of Hsc70 is its ability to β€�dismountβ€� the clathrin
lattice. Thus, addition of ATP and Hsc70 to clathrincoated vesicles in
vitro causes disassembly of the clathrin lattice [80]. This is a stoichiometric reaction that
requires 3 mol of Hsc70 and ATP for the dissociation of 1 mol of clathrin
triskelions [80-82].


Similary to all Hsp70 family members, Hsc70 requires a protein containing a
J-domain to β€�workβ€� with a particular substrate [83]. Auxilin, which binds to clathrin and contains a J-domain,
plays that function. The J-domain in the auxilin molecule is positioned in a
way that the motif required for the interaction with the Hsc70 protein is
exposed on the outside of the lattice. The QLMLT sequence (1638-1642) located
in the C-terminal portion of the clathrin heavy chain is also required [84] (Fig. 5B). The following
model of lattice disassembly is proposed: bending at the location of
intersection of β€�anklesβ€� caused by the interaction with auxilin enables Hsc70
to bind to its site near the C-terminus of the clathrin molecule. It is assumed
that one vertex of the triskelion binds one molecule of Hsc70 and for the
strong interaction to be achieved hydrolysis of ATP is required. Therefore,
deformation of the clathrin lattice which had begun after binding to auxilin is
enhanced [85].


Other clathrin-interacting proteins


Apart from the AP-2 adaptor complex, clathrin-coated vesicles also contain
other proteins. A vast array of monomeric adaptors that bind to clathrin and
are able to interact with integral membrane proteins, PtdIns( 4,5)P2 and AP-2,
in order to ensure the occurrence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of
transmembrane proteins have been identified (Fig. 6). Examples
of such adaptors include epsins, the CALM/AP180 protein, HIP1, and HIP1R. The
N-terminal domain of these proteins that binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 is called ENT H
(epsin N-terminal homology) or ANT H (AP180 N-terminal homology domain).
Another group of monomeric proteins includes Dab2, ARH, and Numb. These
proteins bind to AP-2, and some of them interact with clathrin. They all
contain a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) responsible for interaction with
membrane lipids and for recognition of the FXNPXY motif localized in the
cytoplasmic portions of LDLRs. It was demonstrated that phosphorylation of
tyrosine at this motif is not a prerequisite for the binding of monomeric
adaptors [71].

Fig. 6

domain structure. Figure adapted from [70]

In addition to binding to cell membrane lipids, the adaptors recognize the
signals localized in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptors. These may
include posttranslational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination),
short peptide motifs, or both [86]. It
is presumed that binding of the adaptor to the cytoplasmic membrane is
stabilized upon simultaneous interaction of the adaptor with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and
the receptor [70, 87].


The role of all these adaptor proteins is poorly understood. Perhaps, the use
of various proteins enables to avoid simultaneous accumulation of various GPCR
in the same clathrin-coated vesicle [88].


Specific recognition of the receptor for its subsequent removal from the
membrane is the role of adaptors that has been most researched. This
recognition leads to disruption of the delivery of the receptor to the ligand
responsible for its activation and often to the transfer of the receptor to
lysosomes for degradation. Internalization of the receptor mediated by a
specific adaptor may also result in the receptor being directed to another
cellular compartment with its own set of signaling molecules [89]. Another consequence of the selective
removal of the receptor from the cell surface may be such a cellular
development, which is associated with one of the daughter cells receiving a
different set of adaptors responsible for the endocytosis of certain receptors.
For instance, during the development of Drosophila sense organs, the adaptor
Numb is transferred to only one of the two daughter cells. Numb is responsible
for the adjustment of the development of the cell it is located in by
inhibiting transduction of signals along the Notch-pathway. Inhibition is
attributed to receptor endocytosis; however, it is unclear whether the protein
Numb controls the endocytosis of Notch directly or via the transmembrane
regulator of Notch β€“ Sandopo [90, 91].


As mentioned above, the proteins Numb, Dab2, and ARH contain a domain that
specifically recognizes the FXNPXY sequence in the cytoplasmic portion of the
receptors. It was demonstrated that the proteins ARH and Dab2 are involved in
the endocytosis of the LDL receptor, and the Numb protein regulates the
endocytosis of the integral membrane proteins, including the EGF and Notch
receptors [88].


The Epsin protein is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian
cells, where it plays an important role in the cytoplasmic membrane bending
attributed to the action of the ENT H domain. The occurrence of this process is
associated with the C-terminal portion of the protein binding to clathrin coat
components (clathrin and AP-2 N-terminal domains, and EHdomain of the protein
Eps15), which leads to the assembly of the clathrin lattice. The UIM-repeats of
the epsin protein that acts as an adaptor protein facilitate recognition of the
ubiquitinated β€�cargoβ€�: in particular transmembrane proteins [88, 92].


The proteins AP180 and CALM ease the assembly of the clathrin-coated vesicles
and regulate their size [20, 93, 94]. It is assumed that AP180 and CALM play an important role
in ensuring the polarity and control of the growth of the axons and dendrites
of the hippocampal neurons [95].


TRIP8b β€“ novel clathrin-binding protein and a potential endocytosis
adaptor


IP8b (TPR-containing Rab8b interacting protein) is one of the recently
discovered potential adaptors involved in the regulation of endocytosis. Being
expressed predominantly in brain tissue, TR IP8b was initially identified as a
protein that interacts with the small GTP-ase Rab8b [96]. Six TPR-motifs are located in the C-terminal part of TR
IP8b, forming the TPR-domain (Fig. 7). TPR-motifs represent
repeats consisting of 34 amino acids. These motifs are found in many proteins
Fig 7. Schematic representation of the protein TRIP8b domain organization and
are involved in protein-protein interactions [97]. These repeats are often arranged consecutively, resulting
in a spatial structure consisting of two antiparallel Ξ±-helices connected by a
short loop [98]. The N-terminal portion
of TR IP8b does not contain sequences homologous to other known proteins and
undergoes alternative splicing [99].

It is known that TR IP8b is 40% identical to the Pex5 protein (peroxin protein)
and their C-terminal portion containing TPR-domains are 57% identical (other
names for the TR IP8b include Pex5Rp, Pex5p related protein) [100]. The Pex5 protein is found in many
organisms ranging from yeast to mammals; it is responsible for the recognition
and import of peroxisomal proteins containing the C-terminal SKL motif
(peroxisometargeting signal type 1, PTS1) from the cytosol into peroxisomes.
Despite the fact that TR IP8b recognizes the PTS1 sequence it has been
established that it is not involved in peroxisomal protein import [100].


TR IP8b interacts with the Rab8b protein and also directly with a protein that
forms the HCN -channel (Hyperpolarization- activated, Cyclic
Nucleotide-regulated channel) [99, 101]. It was found that TR IP8b binds to the
CIRL1 receptor [102], which belongs to
the GPCR class, and to the transmembrane protein called Caspr [103].


HCN channels belong to the family of voltage-dependent channels [104-106]. These channels are involved in the control of the heart
and brain pacemakersβ€™ activity, ensuring resting membrane potential and
synaptic transmission (see reviews [107] and [108]).
Investigations into the interactions between TR IP8b and the HCN channel
demonstrated that TR IP8b regulates the functions and surface expression of the
channel [99, 101, 109, 110]. It is assumed that TR IP8b acts as an
auxiliary adaptor for HCN and that the interaction is mediated by at least two
different regions in the TR IP8b and HCN molecules [111, 112].


All of the previously identified interactions of TR IP8b with other proteins
were mediated by the TPR-domains localized in the C-terminal part of TR IP8b
[96, 99, 100] or a segment
located in the conserved central region of the protein [109, 111, 112].


As mentioned above, the N-terminal portion of TR IP8b undergoes alternative
splicing. Isoforms of the protein generated as a result of splicing affect the
HCN transport and its localization on the cytoplasmic membrane differently:
some isoforms increase the surface expression of HCN 1 and others decrease it
[109, 110]. It was found that TR IP8b interacts with clathrin and
this interaction involves the N-terminal portion of the protein TR IP8b [103, 113]. The clathrin-binding site in the TR IP8b molecule
consists of two short motifs reminiscent of the β€�clathrin boxβ€� motif.


In order to investigate the TR IP8b functions two types of knockout mice were
obtained. The phenotype of mice lacking certain TR IP8b isoforms was identical
to that of wild-type mice [114].
Abnormalities in the motor learning and increased resistance during the
behavioral despair test were observed in mice with a complete absence of the
protein (TR IP8b-/-) [115].


The need to conduct further investigations into clathrin-mediated endocytosis
is unquestionable. Internalization of ligand-activated receptors and the
functions of various accessory proteins are of significant interest.
Interactions between clathrin and numerous adaptor proteins are currently being
actively investigated. Clathrin is involved in various processes: endocytosis,
intracellular traffic, and segregation of chromosomes. It is assumed that
abnormalities in the functioning of clathrin can lead to the development of
certain diseases. In this regard, investigations into the structure and
functions of clathrin-coated vesicles, as well as the proteins involved in the
formation of the latter, is of interest from the point of view of molecular
biology and biomedicine.
