Campath-1H is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets CD52, a cell surface protein expressed on lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils. A single dose of Campath-1H leads to a rapid and profound lymphopenia. Campath-1H has been used in Cambridge as an experimental treatment of multiple sclerosis for more than 15 years. Here, we summarise our clinical and laboratory findings, describing how this prototypical 'bench to bedside' therapy continues to inform basic science, revealing aspects of the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and autoimmunity.
