Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) may have great potential as therapies for autoimmune diseases. Their development as treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) is promising. Partially effective immunomodulatory therapies have been helpful for many MS patients; however, for patients failing these immunomodulatory treatments, MAbs are an important new treatment option. Currently, MAbs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of many conditions, including autoimmune diseases. Four MAbs that have been investigated as potential treatments for MS are reviewed in this article. Of these MAbs, natalizumab is approved for treatment of MS. The other three MAbs (alemtuzumab, rituximab, and daclizumab) are all promising therapies in development for treatment of MS. Adverse effects are relatively mild for these MAbs; however, care in administration and management of these agents is emphasized. Overall, these MAb therapies have great promise in the treatment of MS.
