Campath-1H is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 expressed on lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. It has been tested extensively in lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation. Although its use in children has been limited to date, so far it appears to be well tolerated in children. Currently, studies are being implemented to further assess its safety and efficacy in pediatric organ transplantation. Immune cell depletion using Campath-1H appears to be particularly useful in organ transplantation in that lower doses of maintenance immunosuppressive drugs are needed. This feature is particularly attractive in children.
