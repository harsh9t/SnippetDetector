BACKGROUND: Statins treatment may have potential clinical impact in vascular disease beyond cholesterol lowering. Its benefits have been documented in cerebral ischaemia and in subarachnoid haemorrhage. In intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), experimental models in statin-treated animals have better outcome than non-treated ones, but in humans the relationship is unclear. We investigated whether patients treated with statins before the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage have a better outcome at 3 months than patients without statins pre-treatment. METHODS: Retrospective review of primary intracerebral haemorrhage case series from a prospective stroke register. We recorded demographics, vascular risk factors, previous statin treatment, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at onset, ICH scale, hematoma volume and location, ventricular extension of the hematoma, and functional outcome at 3 months. The effect of prior statin treatment on good outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0 to 2) was analysed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We included 269 patients (age 71.9 +/- 12.4, mean +/- SD, 152 males). Thirty-four patients (12.6%) were on prior statin treatment when admitted. There were no differences in fasting serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels between the statin pre-treated groups and the group without statin pre-treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed a significant association between age (OR: 0.95; CI 0.92-0.97), ICH volume (OR: 0.96; CI 0.94-0.98), GCS (OR: 1.55; CI 1.21-1.98), pre-treatment with statins (OR: 4.21; CI 1.47-12.17; P = 0.008), and good outcome at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Statins pre-treatment of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage may provide better functional outcome at 3 months of acute onset.
