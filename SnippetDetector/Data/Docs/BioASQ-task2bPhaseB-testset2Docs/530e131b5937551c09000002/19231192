Statins have been shown in two recent small phase I/II trials to be associated with a marked reduction in clinical and transcranial Doppler (TCD) evidence of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical impact of this treatment in a larger number of patients. Fifty-eight individuals were treated in the year before, and 72 patients treated in the year after, the introduction of a 2week course of 40mg/day pravastatin therapy for SAH. Statins did not result in reduced TCD velocities, clinical or angiographic vasospasm, or improvements in global outcome at the time of hospital discharge. A measurable reduction in the rates of vasospasm was expected, based on the size of the effect of statin therapy in the previous small studies. There remains significant uncertainty as to the role of statins in preventing vasospasm after SAH.
