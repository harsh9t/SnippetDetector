INTRODUCTION: Statins have been studied in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but the history, pharmacology, and studies have not been reviewed recently. METHODS: The development of statins as well as their biological effects and pharmacology are reviewed. Recent clinical studies in patients with SAH are summarized. RESULTS: Statins lower serum cholesterol but they also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, angiogenic, neuroprotective, vasoprotective, and endothelial preserving actions. In patients with SAH, they may decrease the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, although the effects on overall outcome are less clear. They should be continued in patients who are taking them on admission and perhaps initiated in those who have indications for them. Side effects are rare. CONCLUSION: A large randomized, double-blind clinical trial is needed before it can be determined that statins are beneficial for patients with aneurysmal SAH.
