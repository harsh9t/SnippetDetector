Epigenetic modifications must underlie lineage-specific differentiation as terminally differentiated cells express tissue-specific genes, but their DNA sequence is unchanged. Haematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study epigenetic modifications during cell-fate decisions, as multipotent progenitors (MPPs) differentiate into progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors. Although DNA methylation is critical for myeloid versus lymphoid differentiation, as demonstrated by the myeloerythroid bias in Dnmt1 hypomorphs, a comprehensive DNA methylation map of haematopoietic progenitors, or of any multipotent/oligopotent lineage, does not exist. Here we examined 4.6 million CpG sites throughout the genome for MPPs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and thymocyte progenitors (DN1, DN2, DN3). Marked epigenetic plasticity accompanied both lymphoid and myeloid restriction. Myeloid commitment involved less global DNA methylation than lymphoid commitment, supported functionally by myeloid skewing of progenitors following treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Differential DNA methylation correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island shores than CpG islands. Many examples of genes and pathways not previously known to be involved in choice between lymphoid/myeloid differentiation have been identified, such as Arl4c and Jdp2. Several transcription factors, including Meis1, were methylated and silenced during differentiation, indicating a role in maintaining an undifferentiated state. Additionally, epigenetic modification of modifiers of the epigenome seems to be important in haematopoietic differentiation. Our results directly demonstrate that modulation of DNA methylation occurs during lineage-specific differentiation and defines a comprehensive map of the methylation and transcriptional changes that accompany myeloid versus lymphoid fate decisions.

Hematopoietic stem cells () can self renew for life and differentiate into all myeloid and lymphoid blood lineages2 (ig. 1a). ecent evidence suggests that  methylation plays a direct role in regulating both  self-renewal and commitment to lymphoid versus myeloid fates1,3. lthough the frequencies of myeloid progenitors and differentiated cells were normal in nmt1-hypomorphic mice, lymphoid-restricted s and their downstream thymic  cell progenitors (1, 2 and 3) were diminished. n the bone marrow of nmt1-hypomorphs, lymphoid, but not myeloid, transcripts were reduced, and promoters of two myeloerythroid genes were hypomethylated in s. hese observations support a critical role for  methylation in lymphocyte development, possibly through regulation of gene expression.Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can self renew for life and differentiate into all myeloid and lymphoid blood lineages2 (Fig. 1a). Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation plays a direct role in regulating both HSC self-renewal and commitment to lymphoid versus myeloid fates1,3. Although the frequencies of myeloid progenitors and differentiated cells were normal in Dnmt1-hypomorphic mice, lymphoid-restricted CLPs and their downstream thymic T cell progenitors (DN1, DN2 and DN3) were diminished. In the bone marrow of Dnmt1-hypomorphs, lymphoid, but not myeloid, transcripts were reduced, and promoters of two myeloerythroid genes were hypomethylated in HSCs. These observations support a critical role for DNA methylation in lymphocyte development, possibly through regulation of gene expression.

Here we have examined genome-wide methylation profiles of the mouse hematopoietic system, because it provides the first opportunity to examine differential methylation of a hierarchical progression of purified cell populations with well-characterized differentiation potentials (ig. 1a). ight populations, ranging from uncommitted  through oligopotent progenitors specified during myeloid versus lymphoid fate decisions, were -purified and subjected to omprehensive igh-throughput rray-based elative ethylation () analysis (ig. 1a and upplementary ig. 1). his approach investigated the methylation status of p. Gs throughout the mouse genome using an algorithm favoring regions of higher CpG density (including all CpG islands4), but without bias for CpG location relative to genes5. Using CHARM, we recently found that differential methylation occurs more frequently in CpG island β€�shoresβ€� (regions within 2kb of an islands) than in CpG islands during multiple cellular differentiation processes6,7. Additionally, mRNA of each population was subjected to microarray and RT-PCR analyses to generate gene expression data. Thus, we were able to directly compare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) throughout the genome with expression levels of nearby genes for all eight populations.

This analysis revealed s in numerous genes known to play a role in lymphoid or myeloid fate specification. or example, ck, the src family kinase member responsible for initiating signaling downstream of the  cell receptor ()8, was transcriptionally upregulated from 1 to 3, consistent with its role in pre- signal transduction (ig. 1b). nterestingly, as ck transcription was upregulated, p. Gs in exon 1 through intron 2 were progressively demethylated (Fig. 1b). Similarly, myeloid specification from MPP through GMP was accompanied by transcriptional upregulation and progressive hypomethylation of Mpo, which encodes an enzyme central to the microbicidal activity of neutrophils9 (Fig. 1c). Additionally, Cxcr2, which encodes a chemokine receptor responsible for neutrophil chemotaxis10, was upregulated during myeloid commitment from CMP through GMP, while the gene was demethylated (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Furthermore, Gadd45Ξ±, which is implicated in myeloid development11, was found to be concomitantly upregulated and demethylated in the CMP to GMP transition (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Gadd45Ξ± can actively demethylate DNA in different model systems12,13; thus, hypomethylation of Gadd45Ξ± during myelopoiesis may promote further hypomethylation of genes regulating myeloid commitment; however, the role of Gadd45Ξ± in promoting demethylation is still controversial14. Taken together, these data indicate that CHARM analysis correctly identifies DMRs in known lymphoid and myeloid specifying genes, each confirmed by pyrosequencing and gene expression analysis, making it a valuable tool for identifying candidate genes important for lymphoid or myeloid fate specification.

Viewed globally,  analysis revealed striking epigenetic plasticity, resulting in increased overall methylation upon lymphoid relative to myeloid commitment (able 1). ost s distinguishing + cells from  lost methylation during this step of early lymphoid commitment, but upon the subsequent transition to 1, 15-fold more s showed gain, as opposed to loss, of methylation. imilarly in the earliest step of myeloid commitment from + to  there were substantially more hypermethylated than hypomethylated s, but nearly all s showed loss of methylation on transition from  to . omparing 1 to , two populations similarly differentiated towards lymphoid and myeloid fates, respectively, there were 8-fold more s with higher-level methylation in 1 cells, suggesting a skewing toward greater methylation in lymphoid compared to myeloid hematopoiesis. hese observations might explain why nmt1-hypomorphic mice, which are unable to properly maintain p. G methylation, have normal myeloid, but diminished lymphoid development1,3.

To test the hypothesis that reduced methylation preferentially promotes myeloid as opposed to lymphoid differentiation, we turned to an in vitro assay system that promotes both myeloid and lymphoid development15,16. n the presence of 5-aza-2β€²-deoxycytidine, the percentage of myeloid progeny increased at the expense of lymphoid progeny for +, , 1 and 2, but not 3, which remained lymphoid committed (upplementary ig. 3aβ€“b). his myeloid skewing was most pronounced in 1 cells, perhaps indicating that the large number of methylated s in 1 compared to  is critical for lymphoid specification (able 1). e conclude that inhibiting  methylation promotes myeloid versus lymphoid specification, providing a mechanism for the myeloid skewing observed in nmt1 hypomorphs1.To test the hypothesis that reduced methylation preferentially promotes myeloid as opposed to lymphoid differentiation, we turned to an in vitro assay system that promotes both myeloid and lymphoid development15,16. In the presence of 5-aza-2β€²-deoxycytidine, the percentage of myeloid progeny increased at the expense of lymphoid progeny for MPPFL+, CLP, DN1 and DN2, but not DN3, which remained lymphoid committed (Supplementary Fig. 3aβ€“b). This myeloid skewing was most pronounced in DN1 cells, perhaps indicating that the large number of methylated DMRs in DN1 compared to CLP is critical for lymphoid specification (Table 1). We conclude that inhibiting DNA methylation promotes myeloid versus lymphoid specification, providing a mechanism for the myeloid skewing observed in Dnmt1 hypomorphs1.

Consistent with our previous studies6,7, most s were in p. G island shores (Table 1). The exceptions were for MPPFLβ�’ vs. MPPFL+, and MPPFL+ vs. CLP, in which most DMRs were in CpG islands: interestingly, both of these transitions are involved in early differentiation. Differential DNA methylation and gene expression showed a statistically significant inverse relationship particularly at CpG island shores (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). As the CHARM array design was targeted toward CpG density but not gene architecture per se, we also created a new array that included all promoters, and hybridized DNA from three of the groups studied earlier. Analysis showed a similar statistically significant inverse relationship between differential DNA methylation and gene expression, again particularly at CpG island shores (Supplementary Fig. 4gβ€“h). Thus, CpG island shores are the regions with the most variability in DNA methylation between hematopoietic populations, and this variability correlates best with changes in gene expression. [However, not all DNA methylation changes correlated with changes in gene expression: for example, Tha1 is demethylated during lymphoid specification (see CHARM plots on http://charm.jhmi.edu/hsc), but is expressed at high levels from MPP through DN3. In converse, and as expected since there are multiple mechanisms for epigenetic regulation, we also identified lineage-specifying genes with changes in expression levels, but not in DNA methylation, such as Gata3 and Hes1 (see microarrays deposited in GEO).

Many novel genes with the potential to contribute to myeloid/lymphoid fate specification were revealed by comparing -identified s with gene expression data. or example, rl4c, a member of the -ribosylation factor family of -binding proteins, was upregulated and hypomethylated in 1-3 thymocytes (ig. 3a). rl4c may play a role in vesicular transport17, but its role in lymphoid specification is unknown. ultiple other genes with s suggestive of a role in lymphoid development, such as mad7, cnt2 and ited2, were also identified (upplementary ig. 5). mad7, which negatively regulates -beta signaling, is selectively upregulated and hypomethylated at the earliest stages of thymocyte development, suggesting a role in promoting lymphopoiesis (upplementary ig. 5a). owever, it causes myeloid lineage skewing when overexpressed in human cord blood progenitors18. cnt2 transcripts were downregulated in thymocyte progenitors, and the locus became hypermethylated progressively in 1-3 progenitors (upplementary ig. 5b), consistent with a role for cnt2 in enabling the myeloid potential that is lost during final lymphoid lineage commitment at the 3 stage19,20.Many novel genes with the potential to contribute to myeloid/lymphoid fate specification were revealed by comparing CHARM-identified DMRs with gene expression data. For example, Arl4c, a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family of GTP-binding proteins, was upregulated and hypomethylated in DN1-3 thymocytes (Fig. 3a). Arl4c may play a role in vesicular transport17, but its role in lymphoid specification is unknown. Multiple other genes with DMRs suggestive of a role in lymphoid development, such as Smad7, Gcnt2 and Cited2, were also identified (Supplementary Fig. 5). Smad7, which negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling, is selectively upregulated and hypomethylated at the earliest stages of thymocyte development, suggesting a role in promoting lymphopoiesis (Supplementary Fig. 5a). However, it causes myeloid lineage skewing when overexpressed in human cord blood progenitors18. Gcnt2 transcripts were downregulated in thymocyte progenitors, and the locus became hypermethylated progressively in DN1-3 progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 5b), consistent with a role for Gcnt2 in enabling the myeloid potential that is lost during final lymphoid lineage commitment at the DN3 stage19,20.

Novel potential regulators of myelopoiesis were also identified. he dp2 locus was hypomethylated and its transcript was upregulated in  and  relative to thymocyte progenitors (ig. 3b). dp2 is thought to repress transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases and regulating nucleosome assembly21. ach1 was also hypomethylated and expressed from β�’ through , but was silenced in  and 1-3 thymocyte progenitors (upplementary ig. 5d), suggesting it may contribute to myelopoiesis. ach1 has been implicated in transcriptional repression through association with histone deacetylases and its drosophila homolog is known to play a role in gonadal, limb, and ocular development22. hus, dp2 and ach1 may feedback on the epigenome to control expression of tissue specific genes, but their role in hematopoiesis remains uncharacterized.Novel potential regulators of myelopoiesis were also identified. The Jdp2 locus was hypomethylated and its transcript was upregulated in CMP and GMP relative to thymocyte progenitors (Fig. 3b). Jdp2 is thought to repress transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases and regulating nucleosome assembly21. Dach1 was also hypomethylated and expressed from MPPFLβ�’ through GMP, but was silenced in CLP and DN1-3 thymocyte progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 5d), suggesting it may contribute to myelopoiesis. Dach1 has been implicated in transcriptional repression through association with histone deacetylases and its drosophila homolog is known to play a role in gonadal, limb, and ocular development22. Thus, Jdp2 and Dach1 may feedback on the epigenome to control expression of tissue specific genes, but their role in hematopoiesis remains uncharacterized.

Our analyses also revealed a set of genes that were progressively hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced as differentiation progressed towards both myeloid and lymphoid fates, suggesting a role in maintenance of a multipotent state. eis1, 290005218ik, lf, oxa9 and rdm16 are all such candidates (ig. 3c and upplementary ig. 6). eis1 is known to be required for hematopoiesis and megakaryocyte lineage development23 and may function cooperatively with oxa9 to regulate hematopoiesis24. urthermore, both lf and rdm16 have been implicated in hematopoiesis25,26.Our analyses also revealed a set of genes that were progressively hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced as differentiation progressed towards both myeloid and lymphoid fates, suggesting a role in maintenance of a multipotent state. Meis1, 2900052L18Rik, Hlf, Hoxa9 and Prdm16 are all such candidates (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6). Meis1 is known to be required for hematopoiesis and megakaryocyte lineage development23 and may function cooperatively with Hoxa9 to regulate hematopoiesis24. Furthermore, both Hlf and Prdm16 have been implicated in hematopoiesis25,26.

Lastly, epigenetic chromatin modifiers, including dac7a and nmt3b, were also differentially methylated during hematopoietic differentiation, suggesting feed-forward mechanisms that could expand and lock in epigenetic programming necessary for cell fate commitment (ig. 3d and upplementary igure 7). dac7, which encodes a histone deacetylase and represses transcription, was demethylated and upregulated in 1-3 thymocytes (ig. 3d). ince dac7 is highly expressed in 3 cells, which can no longer be reprogrammed toward a myeloid fate by ectopic -2 signaling19, it may actively repress genes responsible for maintaining myeloid lineage potential19. n contrast, nmt3b, a methyltransferase responsible for de novo p. G methylation, is hypermethylated and downregulated progressively in CMPs and GMPs (Supplementary Figure 7). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were shown to be essential for HSC self-renewal, but their roles in lineage commitment remain inconclusive27. Downregulation of Dnmt3b in myeloid committed cells could prevent new DNA methylation, helping to maintain the observed hypomethylated state associated with myelopoiesis. In addition, the upregulation of Dnmt3b in DN1 independent of DNA methylation changes might explain the dramatic acquisition of DNA methylation from CLP to DN1 (Table 1).

In summary, these data provide a comprehensive map of the methylome during myeloid and lymphoid commitment from hematopoietic progenitors. o facilitate the general accessibility of the methylome for these hematopoietic progenitors, we also provide here a novel web platform with which the methylation status of any genomic locus of interest can be easily queried to generate output methylation plots. n addition to identifying candidate genes for further investigation, the data suggest several important themes for the epigenetics of lineage-specific differentiation. irst, myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis achieve markedly different methylation endpoints in differentiation, with lymphopoiesis depending much more heavily on the acquisition of  methylation marks, and myelopoiesis depending much more on their loss. esides providing a mechanism for the proposed 1-dependence of lymphopoiesis, these results may also explain the therapeutic specificity of  demethylating drug treatment of myelodysplasia, in which malignant cells arrested in early development may be induced to differentiate by  demethylation28. n addition, the results show a remarkable dynamic plasticity in methylation during lineage development. he changes are evocative of addingtonβ€™s illustrations of hills and valleys in the epigenetic landscape of development. e have recently proposed that development depends on dynamic stochastic variation in the epigenetic landscape in a given genetic environment29, and the maturation of undifferentiated progenitors to progressively more differentiated states could restrict that variation. upport for this idea is provided in an accompanying manuscript in this journal examining the epigenetic memory in i. PS cells derived from fibroblasts and blood30. In that paper, lymphocyte-derived iPS cells cluster with CLP but not the myeloid lineage using DNA methylation differences we identified, suggesting the existence of lymphocyte memory in these iPS cells consistent with the DNA methylation profiles described in this paper.
