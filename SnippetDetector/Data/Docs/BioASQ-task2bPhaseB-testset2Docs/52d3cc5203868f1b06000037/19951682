Recent genome-wide descriptions of CpG methylation patterns in mammalian cells identified many differentially methylated regions (DMRs) located at CpG island "shores." Feinberg, Daley, and colleagues now report in Nature Genetics that reconfiguration of these DMRs occurs during induced reprogramming (Doi et al., 2009).
