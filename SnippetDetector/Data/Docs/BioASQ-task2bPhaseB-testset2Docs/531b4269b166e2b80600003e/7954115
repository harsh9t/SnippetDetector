The effects of spontaneous and experimentally induced congestive heart failure on serum thyroxine (T4), 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), 3,3'5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T3), free T4, free T3 concentrations, and the serum T4 and T3 concentrations in response to administration of thyrotropin were studied. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations were not different between eight dogs with spontaneous congestive heart failure and normal age matched control dogs. Seven dogs with experimental heart failure were tested before and after induction of congestive heart failure by rapid ventricular pacing. Mean serum T4 and free T3 concentrations were decreased and mean serum reverse T3 concentration was increased following induction of heart failure. The serum T4 and T3 responses to thyrotropin were not altered. Thyroid gland morphology appeared normal in dogs with experimental heart failure. Experimental congestive heart failure, similar to some other nonthyroidal illnesses, alters thyroid hormone secretion and metabolism in dogs.
