OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of low-dose thyroxin in elderly patients with refractory heart failure (RHF) and euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS). METHODS: Fifty-four elderly patients with RHF and ESS were randomized into conventional treatment group (n=32) and L-thyroxine group with additional oral L-thyroxine at the daily dose of 6.25-25 microg (n=22). The changes in the plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptides (BNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and cardiac function (NYHA level) of the two groups were compared after 1 month of treatment. RESULTS: Five patients receiving conventional treatment died due to severe arrhythmia during the treatment, and in the other 27 patients, the levels of plasma BNP, LVEF, and cardiac function showed no significant improvements after 1 month of treatment (P>0.01). In L-thyroxine group, no death or severe arrhythmia occurred, and the levels of plasma BNP, LVEF, and cardiac function were significantly improved after the treatment (P<0.01). No thyrotoxicosis occurred during the administration of L-thyroxine in the latter group. CONCLUSION: Low-dose L-thyroxine in addition to the conventional treatments may enhance the therapeutic effect in elderly patients with RHF and ESS.
