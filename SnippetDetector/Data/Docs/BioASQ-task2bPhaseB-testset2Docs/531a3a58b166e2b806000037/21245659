The discovery that the Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) is the necessary cause of cervical cancer has led to the development of prophylactic vaccines. Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among young women in Europe: mortality is still high, despite its important reduction due to screening programs for early detection. Besides cervical cancer, HPV is responsible for a significant proportion of other anogenital cancers and an increasing number of oropharyngeal cancers, representing together an at least equal burden compared to cervical cancer. HPV is also responsible for conditions such as condyloma acuminata (genital warts) and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Organized vaccination programs against HPV have the potential to prevent about 70% of cervical cancers and the vast majority of the other HPV-related conditions. Recommendations for HPV vaccination of at least one cohort of females have been issued in nearly all western European countries, and national/regional publicly funded vaccination programs have been introduced in most of them. Different approaches have been chosen for the implementation of HPV vaccination, based on the organization of each country's health care system. A brief outline of these programs in Europe is presented. As for all preventive public health interventions, high coverage of the target population with HPV vaccines pre-exposure is essential to achieve maximum reduction of cases: therefore, in order to obtain the maximum and most equitable coverage and future benefit, programs targeting adolescents before exposure to HPV should be preferred and population-based. Catch-up programs should also be implemented wherever possible, in order to deliver more and even earlier benefits, and effective communication strategies need to be adopted.
