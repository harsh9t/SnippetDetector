OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes of pregnancies complicated by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to estimate potential associations between disease characteristics and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed all pregnancies complicated by RA delivered at our institution from June 2001 through June 2009. Fisher exact tests were used to calculate odds ratios. Univariable regression was performed using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Forty-six pregnancies in 40 women were reviewed. Sixty percent of pregnancies had evidence of disease flare and 28% delivered prior to 37 weeks. We did not identify associations between preterm birth and active disease at conception or during pregnancy. In univariate analysis, discontinuation of medication because of pregnancy was associated with a significantly earlier gestational age at delivery (362/7 versus 383/7 weeks, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Women with RA may be at higher risk for preterm delivery.
