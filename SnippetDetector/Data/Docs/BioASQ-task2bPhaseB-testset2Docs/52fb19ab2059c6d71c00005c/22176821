OBJECTIVE: to compare the obstetric prognosis before and after the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: a survey in RA women patients who become sexually active before disease onset, and who tried or got pregnant after diagnosis was performed. Obstetrical features such as: number of pregnancies, threat of abortion, abortion, early natal death, congenital abnormalities and preeclampsia-eclampsia syndrome, before and after RA onset were compared. RESULTS: only 47 women were eligible (age: 40.5 ± 11.0 years; time of evolution: 15.9 ± 11.5 years; positive rheumatoid factor: 93.6 %) from 700 screened. After RA onset there were 63 gestations in 36 patients who got pregnant (secondary infertility rate: 21.3 %). A significant increase in frequency and number of cesarean deliveries, besides a higher number of pregnancies with preeclampsia, were found after RA onset. Additionally, four newborns with congenital anomalies were reported after the disease onset compared to none before RA onset. CONCLUSIONS: compared to pre-RA obstetric events, a higher frequency and number of adverse outcomes was found in pregnancies that occurred after RA onset.
