Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can affect the menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes of the affected subjects. There is very little data on this aspect of the disease in Indian patients. Our aim was to study the menstrual, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes in these patients in comparison with patients of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and also to study the effect of cyclophosphamide therapy on menstrual cycles in patients with SLE. Four hundred and twenty patients of SLE (210) and RA (210) were interviewed using a standard questionnaire and available medical records used. After disease-onset, the chances of adverse pregnancy outcomes were significantly more in patients with SLE compared to RA [OR = 5.17 (2.13-12.52); p ≤ 0.001]. Compared to the National average in India, the average number of living children is lesser in patients with RA (2.39 ± 1.39, p = 0.002), but more so in patients with SLE (1.44 ± 1.35, p = 0.001). A younger age at diagnosis and cyclophosphamide therapy was found to be independently associated with menstrual irregularities after disease-onset. We conclude that pregnancy outcome in patients with SLE in India is worse in comparison to patients with RA. Average family size of patients with SLE and RA is less when compared to National average in India. Patients with SLE are more prone for menstrual irregularities, especially those who receive cyclophosphamide treatment.
