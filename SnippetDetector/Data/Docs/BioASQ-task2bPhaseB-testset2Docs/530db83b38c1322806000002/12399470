p105, also known as NF-kappaB1, is an atypical IkappaB molecule with a multi-domain organization distinct from other prototypical IkappaBs, like IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta. To understand the mechanism by which p105 binds and inhibits NF-kappaB, we have used both p105 and its C-terminal inhibitory segment known as IkappaBgamma for our study. We show here that one IkappaBgamma molecule binds to NF-kappaB dimers wherein at least one NF-kappaB subunit is p50. We suggest that the obligatory p50 subunit in IkappaBgamma.NF-kappaB complexes is equivalent to the N-terminal p50 segment in all p105.NF-kappaB complexes. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the obligatory p50 subunit is masked by IkappaBgamma, whereas the NLS of the nonobligatory NF-kappaB subunit is exposed. Thus, the global binding mode of all IkappaB.NF-kappaB complexes seems to be similar where one obligatory (or specific) NF-kappaB subunit makes intimate contact with IkappaB and the nonobligatory (or nonspecific) subunit is bound primarily through its ability to dimerize. In the case of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, the specific NF-kappaB subunit in the complex is p65. In contrast to IkappaBalpha.NF-kappaB complexes, where the exposed NLS of the nonspecific subunit imports the complex to the nucleus, p105.NF-kappaB and IkappaBgamma.NF-kappaB complexes are cytoplasmic. We show that the death domain of p105 (also of IkappaBgamma) is essential for the cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kappaB by p105 and IkappaBgamma. However, the death domain does not mask the exposed NLS of the complex. We also demonstrate that the death domain alone is not sufficient for cytoplasmic retention and instead functions only in conjunction with other parts in the three-dimensional scaffold formed by the association of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and NF-kappaB dimer. We speculate that additional cytoplasmic protein(s) may sequester the entire p105.NF-kappaB complex by binding through the death domain and other segments, including the exposed NLS.
