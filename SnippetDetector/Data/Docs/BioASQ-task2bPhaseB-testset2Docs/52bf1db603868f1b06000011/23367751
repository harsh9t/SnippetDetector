<abstract>
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the western world. Most deaths will occur due to the progression of cancer into a hormone refractory state. Until recently, docetaxel-based chemotherapy was the only established treatment (shown to increase survival) for patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer. The improved understanding of prostate cancer biology in recent years led to the development of drugs directed against precise tumorigenesis-associated molecular pathways, and significant expansion of treatment horizons for these patients. In 2010-2011, three more agents, with different mechanisms of action, were shown to be associated with a survival benefit in mHRPC, including the dendritic cell vaccine sipuleucel-T (immunotherapy), the 17,20 lyase inhibitor abiraterone (hormonal therapy), and the taxane cabazitaxel (chemotherapy). A fourth agent, denosumab (bone targeted therapy) was also recently approved by the FDA for patients with bone metastasis after showing a reduction in the occurrence of skeletal-related events. This review will focus on recent advances in the standard treatments paradigm in mHRPC.
