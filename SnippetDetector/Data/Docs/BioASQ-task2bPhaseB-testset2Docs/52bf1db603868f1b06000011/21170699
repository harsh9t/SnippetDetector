The Austrian Society for Bone and Mineral Research routinely publishes evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab (Prolia(Â®)) has been recently approved by the European Medical Agency (EMEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Denosumab has been shown to reduce vertebral, non-vertebral,and hip-fracture risk effectively. Together with alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, ibandronate, strontium ranelate, and raloxifene, denosumab constitutes an effective option in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
