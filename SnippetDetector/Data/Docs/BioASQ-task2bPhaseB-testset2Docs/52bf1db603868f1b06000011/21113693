Osteoporosis in men is finally receiving some attention; it has been realized that men are more likely to die after hip fracture. Methods for screening men for osteoporosis include dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and use of fracture risk calculators such as FRAX (World Health Organization) and the Garvan nomogram. Evaluation of men will often identify secondary causes of osteoporosis as well as multiple risk factors. Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, and teriparatide are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved therapy for men. Men on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are at high risk for bone loss and fracture, and all the bisphosphonates have been shown to increase bone density. The new antiresorptive drug, denosumab, although FDA-approved only for postmenopausal women, has been shown in a study of men on ADT to increase bone density in spine, hip, and forearm and decrease vertebral fractures on x-ray. Thus, there is great progress in osteoporosis in men, and recognition of its importance is increasing.
