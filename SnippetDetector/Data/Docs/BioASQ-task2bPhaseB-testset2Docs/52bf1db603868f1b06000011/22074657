Most men with recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy but eventually develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Over the last decade, new therapeutic targets have been identified in CRPC and several new drugs have reached advanced stages of clinical development. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sipuleucel-T and cabazitaxel, and in 2011, abiraterone for patients with metastatic CRPC based on phase 3 trials showing improved survival. Although not yet available for clinical use, a press release in June 2011 announced that radium 223 also demonstrated a survival advantage in men with metastatic CRPC. Emerging therapies in advanced stages of clinical development in CRPC include the hormonal therapies MDV3100 and TAK 700, and the immunotherapy ipilimumab. Results are also pending on phase 3 studies comparing docetaxel plus prednisone with docetaxel given with the novel agents aflibercept, dasatinib, lenalidomide, and custirsen. In addition to these new and emerging therapeutic agents, denosumab was approved for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases due to solid tumor malignancies, providing an alternative to zoledronic acid. While the addition of these new treatment options is a great advance for men with metastatic CRPC, there are many new questions arising regarding sequencing of these treatments with each other, with previously existing therapies, and with the emerging agents now in clinical trials. Furthermore, there are concerns that on-going phase 3 trials may be contaminated if patients go off study treatment to start 1 of the newly approved agents or take the agent subsequently. These realities make clinical trial design more challenging than ever.
