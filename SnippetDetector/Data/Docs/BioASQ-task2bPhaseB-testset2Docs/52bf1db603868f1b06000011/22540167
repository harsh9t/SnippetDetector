Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate approved for the prevention or delay of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer. Recently, the US FDA and the EMA approved denosumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody) to treat skeletal-related events in bone-metastatic prostate cancer. This article summarizes the cost-effectiveness literature pertaining to these two agents when used in the prevention of skeletal-related events secondary to malignancy. Zoledronic acid (and denosumab in comparison with zoledronic acid) have been found to be cost effective and cost ineffective depending on the analytical perspective and model parameters.
