Recently, an increase in extravascular lung water (EVLW) accumulation with diminished left ventricular contractility within 60 min after SCUBA diving was reported. We have observed previously that diving was associated with reduced diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and arterial oxygen pressure for up to 60-80 min postdive. Here we investigated whether increased EVLW persists 2-3h after successive deep dives in a group of seven male divers. The echocardiographic indices of pulmonary water accumulation (ultrasound lung comets (ULC)) and left ventricular function, respiratory functional measurements and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) were assessed 2-3h post diving, while venous gas bubbles (VGB) and the blood levels of NT-proBNP and proANP were analyzed 40 min after surfacing. Spirometry values, flow-volume, DLCO, SaO(2) and ULC were unchanged after each dive, except for significant increase in ULC after the second dive. Left ventricular function was reduced, while NT-proBNP and proANP levels were significantly elevated after majority of dives, suggesting a cardiac strain.
