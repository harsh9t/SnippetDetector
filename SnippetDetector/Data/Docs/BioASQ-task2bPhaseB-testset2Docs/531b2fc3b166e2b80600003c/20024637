Cardiac biomarkers are very important in diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with heart failure. Although not meeting all criteria for an ideal biomarker, natriuretic peptides primarily have a diagnostic and prognostic role. Other routinely available and newly emerging biomarkers have a complementary role in patient management; thus multimarker strategy might be warranted in future. The quest for a single marker or a combination is ongoing and several established, widely available biomarkers might have been overlooked in the field of heart failure. The authors review some of those biomarkers and speculate on the possible roles of combining two or more of them.
