Thyroid hormone (TH) has a fundamental role in cardiovascular homeostasis in both physiological and pathological conditions, influencing cardiac contractility, heart rate (HR), diastolic function and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) through genomic and non-genomic mediated effects. In heart failure (HF) the main alteration of thyroid function is referred to as "low-triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome" (LT3S) characterized by decreased total serum T3 and free T3 (fT3) with normal levels of thyroxine (T4) and thyrotropin (TSH). Even if commonly interpreted as an adaptive factor, LT3S may have potential negative effects, contributing to the progressive deterioration of cardiac function and myocardial remodeling in HF and representing a powerful predictor of mortality in HF patients. All these observations, together with the early evidence of the benefits of T3 administration in HF patients indicate that placebo-controlled prospective studies are now needed to better define the safety and prognostic effects of chronic treatment with synthetic TH in HF.
