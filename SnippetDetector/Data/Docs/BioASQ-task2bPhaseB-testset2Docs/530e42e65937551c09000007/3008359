The authors compared the clinical courses and the CT courses recorded at the same time in patients with primary or secondary cerebral tumors. 69 patients improved their neurologic state under external radiotherapy, 35 patients remained unchanged, and 8 patients had a deteriorated condition. The changes in computed tomography and the modifications of the clinical state of patients corresponded only in 55% of all cases. The reasons are discussed. Some patients suffered from fatigue and weak concentration about three months after the end of radiotherapy, in some cases even the neurologic state was deteriorated. These manifestations known as "early delayed reaction" were reversible.
