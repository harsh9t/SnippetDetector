TP-38 is a recombinant chimeric targeted toxin composed of the EGFR binding ligand TGF-alpha and a genetically engineered form of the Pseudomonas exotoxin, PE-38. After in vitro and in vivo animal studies that showed specific activity and defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), we investigated this agent in a Phase I trial. The primary objective of this study was to define the MTD and dose limiting toxicity of TP-38 delivered by convection-enhanced delivery in patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors. Twenty patients were enrolled in the study and doses were escalated from 25 ng/mL to 100 with a 40 mL infusion volume delivered by two catheters. One patient developed Grade IV fatigue at the 100 ng/mL dose, but the MTD has not been established. The overall median survival after TP-38 for all patients was 23 weeks whereas for those without radiographic evidence of residual disease at the time of therapy, the median survival was 31.9 weeks. Overall, 3 of 15 patients, with residual disease at the time of therapy, have demonstrated radiographic responses and one patient with a complete response and has survived greater than 83 weeks.
