The activity of the pituitary hormones (ACTH, STH, TTH, FSH, LH), the adrenal hormones (cortisol, aldosterone), the kidney hormone (renin), and the thyroid hormones (thyroxine tri-iodthyronine), the thyroxine binding capacity of blood proteins and the activity of the hormones of the pancreas (insulin) and the sex glands (testosterone, estradiol) were studied in 26 males suffering from ischemic heart disease verified by means of selective coronarography and in 20 healthy males with no atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries of the heart. Patients with ischemic heart disease were found to be marked by increased activity in the blood of ACTH, TTH, cortisol, aldosterone, insulin, and estradiol and reduced concentration of STH, thyroxine, and testosterone. These shifts in the activity of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system and in its subordinate hormonal systems play an important role in the origin of the atherosclerotic process and assosiated ischemic heart disease.
