To determine whether thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), have any direct, nongenomic effects on vascular smooth muscle cells, we evaluated the effects of these hormones on rat coronary arteries. Bolus injection of T3 or T4 elicited a transient, dose-dependent decrease in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), as well as an increase in arterial vasodilation. Vasodilation occurred immediately after injection, peaked at 15 seconds, and lasted 80 seconds. Reverse T3 had no effect on CPP or vasodilation. The rapidity of these effects suggests that they are not mediated by the T3-nuclear receptor, but are direct, nongenomic effects of thyroid hormones. Our results also suggest that thyroid hormones may play a role in preventing myocardial ischemia by inducing coronary artery vasodilation.
