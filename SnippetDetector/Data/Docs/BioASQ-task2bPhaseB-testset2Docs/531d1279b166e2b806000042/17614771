<abstract>
Altered cardiac function in thyroid disease is well recognized and has been extensively investigated, vascular function has however been less well studied in those with thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) are important regulators of cardiac function and cardiovascular hemodynamics. The cardiovascular system responds to minimal but persistent changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels producing changes in vascular reactivity and endothelial function. The detection of endothelial dysfunction and/or arterial stiffness allows early identification of individuals at risk as these occur in both patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease and in those with established disease. This may allow treatment to be targeted at high risk individuals with the aim of slowing the progression of vascular disease. The various methods used to assess arterial function are reviewed and the changes demonstrated in human and animal models of thyroid dysfunction.
