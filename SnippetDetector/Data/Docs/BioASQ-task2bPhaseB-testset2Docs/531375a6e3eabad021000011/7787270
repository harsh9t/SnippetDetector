Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at increased risk for sudden death. Recent studies have improved our ability to risk-stratify such patients and have elucidated several potential mechanisms of sudden death and syncope. Certain noninvasive tests, such as signal-averaged electrocardiography and measurements of cardiac autonomic function and QT/QT dispersion, are often abnormal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but are not useful for risk stratification. Myocardial ischemia determined by exercise thallium scintigraphy, however, identifies young patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who are at high risk for cardiac arrest and syncope. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory Holter monitoring in the absence of symptoms of impaired consciousness is associated with a benign prognosis and is not predictive of sudden death. Conversely, ventricular tachycardia induced at electrophysiologic study identifies adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who subsequently experience sudden death. Finally, characterization of the natural history of the genetic defects will increasingly become an integral part of risk evaluation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
