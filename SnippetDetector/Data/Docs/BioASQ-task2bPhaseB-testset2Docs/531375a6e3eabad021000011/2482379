In 79 patients aged 13-65 (mean 36.6) with different types of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ECG Holter's monitorings, M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiographic examinations as well as hemodynamic ones were performed. Ventricular arrhythmias were observed in ECG Holter's recordings in 59.9% of patients. More frequent occurrence of higher grades (3, 4, 5 grades by Lown's classification) of ventricular arrhythmias were stated in patients with significantly thicker intraventricular septum, increase of a left ventricular ejection fraction and a lower left ventricular myocardial mass. There were observed 7 patients without significant forms of ventricular arrhythmias in ECG 24-hours monitoring, but with several, coexisting, well known in literature sudden cardiac death risk factors such as: history of cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death occurrences in a family before the age of 50, preexcitation syndrome, ecg repolarization disorders, history of fainting, physical activity performance or mental stress. It was stated, that risk of severe ventricular arrhythmias occurrence or a sudden cardiac death in patients with coexisting several, above mentioned, risk factors is higher than in remaining patients with the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
