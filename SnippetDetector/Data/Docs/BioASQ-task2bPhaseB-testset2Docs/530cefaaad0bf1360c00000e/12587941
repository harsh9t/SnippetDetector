Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. A number of randomised controlled trials are under way to establish the place of routine screening of asymptomatic men. We report the possible practice of prostate cancer screening with reference to the appropriate age range for screening, how to screen for prostate cancer and how often, and what constitutes an abnormal result that would merit referral to a urologist for a prostate biopsy.
