National guidance (executive letter) EL(97)12 stated that population screening should not be provided by the NHS, or be offered to the public until there is effective screening technology for prostate cancer. The study set out to determine the views of general practitioners and, indirectly, their practice staff on prostate cancer screening in primary care upon receiving EL(97)12. This postal questionnaire survey reveals that 81% (95% CI 75% to 87%) of responding general practitioners in North Staffordshire agreed with EL(97)12 and one in ten said that the executive letter changed their views, suggesting that such national guidance has an effect.
