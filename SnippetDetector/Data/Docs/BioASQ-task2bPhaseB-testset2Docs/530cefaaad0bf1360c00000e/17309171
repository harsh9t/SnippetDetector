AIDIT (Advancing International Co-operation and Developing Infrastructure for Targeted Screening of Prostate Cancer in Men with Genetic Predisposition) is a project funded by the Sixth Framework Programme of the European Community which is endeavouring to facilitate co-operation between European countries in the field of cancer research. The project also aims to raise awareness of familial prostate cancer among health professionals and the public within the associated candidate countries (ACCs) and new member states of the European Union (EU). AIDIT will focus on linking clinical and research teams in the ACCs and new member states with the IMPACT Consortium (Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls), an international team investigating screening and diagnosis for men with a genetic risk of prostate cancer predisposition genes BRCA1 or BRCA2). Cancer research has been targeted as a high priority for the European Community; however, research is most successful when centralised and well coordinated, avoiding the duplication and fragmentation associated with smaller, isolated studies. AIDIT will consolidate the current IMPACT consortium and allow research partners from across the world to benefit from shared knowledge and experience. To date, the AIDIT team has established a website to facilitate communication between project collaborators (www.impact-study.co.uk), has been represented at several international meetings and has facilitated a conference for the IMPACT study to bring together international research teams, clinicians and policy makers.
