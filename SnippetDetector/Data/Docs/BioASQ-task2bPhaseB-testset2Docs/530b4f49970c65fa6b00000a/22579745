Platelets play a fundamental role in hemostasis. Because they do not have a nucleus, proteomics is an ideal way to approach their biochemistry. Platelet proteomics is still a young field that emerged a decade ago. Initial platelet proteomic research focused on general proteome mapping followed by the exploration of sub-cellular compartments, the membrane proteome, and signaling pathways. The initial studies were later completed with the analysis of the platelet releasate and microparticle proteome. The success of these studies led to the application of platelet proteomics to the study of several pathologies where platelets play a fundamental role. Those include platelet-related disorders, such as storage pool disease, gray platelet syndrome, and Quebec platelet disorder; diseases where unwanted platelet activation is highly relevant, such as thrombosis and cardiovascular disease; and other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, uremia, or Alzheimer's disease. In the present review article, we revise the most relevant proteomic studies on platelet-related diseases carried out to date, paying special attention to sample preparation requirements for platelet clinical proteomic studies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Integrated omics.
