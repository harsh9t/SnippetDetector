The search for diagnostic and prognostic markers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been an area of active research in the last decades. Biochemical markers are correlates of intracerebral changes that can be identified in biological fluids, namely: peripheral blood (total blood, red and white blood cells, platelets, plasma and serum), saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. An important feature of a biomarker is that it can be measured objectively and evaluated as (1) an indicator of disease mechanisms (markers of core pathogenic processes or the expression of downstream effects of these processes), or (2) biochemical responses to pharmacological or therapeutic intervention, which can be indicative of disease modification. Platelets have been used in neuropharmacological models since the mid-fifties, as they share several homeostatic functions with neurons, such as accumulation and release of neurotransmitters, responsiveness to variations in calcium concentration, and expression of membrane-bound compounds. Recent studies have shown that platelets also express several components related to the pathogenesis of AD, in particular to the amyloid cascade and the regulation of oxidative stress: thus they can be used in the search for biomarkers of the disease process. For instance, platelets are the most important source of circulating forms of the amyloid precursor protein and other important proteins such as Tau and glycogen synthase kinase-3B. Moreover, platelets express enzymes involved in membrane homeostasis (e.g., phospholipase A2), and markers of the inflammatory process and oxidative stress. In this review we summarize the available literature and discuss evidence concerning the potential use of platelet markers in AD.
