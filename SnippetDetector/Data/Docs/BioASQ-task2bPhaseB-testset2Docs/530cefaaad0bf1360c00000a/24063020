<abstract>
Several lines of evidence indicate that amyloid β (Aβ), particularly Aβ oligomers (AβOs), plays a causative role in Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the action of an anti-AβO antibody to clarify the toxic action of AβOs remain elusive. Here, we showed that the anti-AβO antibody (monoclonal 72D9) can modify the Aβ aggregation pathway. We also found that 72D9 directly sequesters both extracellular and intraneuronal AβOs in a nontoxic state. Thus, therapeutic intervention targeting AβOs is a promising strategy for neuronal protection in Alzheimer's disease.

1. ntroduction
isease modifying therapies for lzheimer's disease () are based on strategic approaches towards the β€�amyloid cascade hypothesisβ€� [1]. mong them, what appears to meet our expectation is ² immunotherapy, which involves immune-mediated ² depletion in the brain [2β€“5]. owever, recent phase  trials of certain ² monoclonal antibodies (e.g., bapineuzumab and solanezumab) failed to significantly slow cognitive and functional declines. espite the disappointing outcomes, the effects of both antibodies were confirmed on biomarkers (http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=3268, http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=3442). rom this point of view, ² immunotherapy is now considered as prophylaxis for patients with mild cognitive impairment. ndeed, solanezumab is now being evaluated in terms of its efficacy for antiamyloid treatment in an asymptomatic lzheimer's disease (4) prevention clinical trial (http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=3379).
ccumulated lines of evidence indicate that memory loss represents a synaptic failure caused directly by soluble ²s [6β€“9] and that amyloid fibrils may cause neuronal injury indirectly via microglial activation [10]. hus, the classical amyloid cascade hypothesis [1] underwent a modification in which emphasis was switched to intermediate forms of ² such as ²s [11β€“15], rather than fibrillar ² [10]. herapeutic intervention targeting ²s alone should be a promising strategy for  treatment [16, 17]. everal major hypotheses underlying the action of ² immunotherapy have been proposed, including phagocytosis by microglia [18], peripheral sink [19], neonatal c receptor (c. Rn) mediated AΞ² transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [20], catalytic modification of AΞ² fibrils [21], intracerebral sequestration of AΞ² in a monomeric state [22], and antibody-mediated neutralization of AΞ²Os and/or tau toxicity [23]. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying disease modifying therapy targeting AΞ²Os remain elusive. Here, among the abovementioned hypothetic mechanisms, the last issue with particular emphasis on the action of an anti-AΞ²O antibody was evaluated. We found that the anti-AΞ²O antibody (72D9) can modify the AΞ² aggregation pathway and that it directly sequesters both extracellular and intraneuronal AΞ²Os in a nontoxic state.

2. aterials and ethods
2.1. ntibodies. Monoclonal 72D9 was generated and characterized as described previously [17]. Polyclonal A11 specific to AΞ²Os was purchased from BioSource (Camarillo, CA, USA). Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor (AF) 488 or 594 and goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with AF 488 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). Anti-mouse IgG2b (the IgG2b isotype) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2. AΞ² Incubation and ThT AssayThT assay was performed as described previously [24]. AΞ² solutions at 12.5β€‰ΞΌM were incubated with Abs (72D9 and IgG2b) at the indicated concentration and at 37Β°C for 24β€‰h. The ThT fluorescence intensity in the incubation mixtures was determined using a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5300PC) (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). The optimum fluorescence intensity of amyloid fibrils was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 446 and 490β€‰nm, respectively, with a reaction mixture (1.0β€‰mL) containing 5β€‰ΞΌM ThT and 50β€‰mM glycine-NaOH at pH 8.5. Fluorescence intensity was measured immediately after preparing the mixture.2.3. AΞ²-Induced Toxicity AssayWe conducted the AΞ²-induced toxicity assay in the presence or absence of Abs according to previously published methods [24]. Briefly, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen) and 5% FBS (Invitrogen). Basically, toxicity was assessed using AΞ²1-42 at 12.5β€‰ΞΌM with (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5β€‰ΞΌM) and without Abs for 24β€‰h at 37Β°C. Toxicity was assessed by LDH assay in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). 2.4. Electron Microscopy (EM)For electron microscopy, samples were diluted with 0.1% distilled ammonia solution and spread on carbon coated grids. The grids were negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid and examined under a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 77β€‰kV. 2.5. Double Immunolabeling and Confocal Laser MicroscopyTo elucidate the ability of 72D9 for the intracerebral sequestration of AΞ²Os, paraffin-embedded mouse brain sections from 72D9- and IgG2b-treated 3xTg-AD mice (n = 6, each) [17] were immunolabeled with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (green). AΞ²Os were immunolabeled with A11, which was detected with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (red), and nucleases, with the antibody against DAPI, which was detected with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (blue). Sections were imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM510).

3. esults and iscussion
3.1. odification of the ² ggregation athway. Our previous in vivo experiments using 72D9 resulted in a marked reduction in the density of Gallyas-Braak positive senile plaques in 3xTg-AD mice with improved cognition [17]. Since 72D9 does not recognize AΞ² fibrils, microglial phagocytosis was not observed [17], indicating that 72D9 can modify the AΞ² aggregation pathway in vivo. To assess this issue, we incubated 12.5β€‰ΞΌM seed-free AΞ²42 alone or with antibodies at 37Β°C for 24β€‰h. As shown in Figure 1(a), ThT fluorescence intensity decreased with the increasing 72D9 concentration, and nonspecific IgG2b showed no antifibrillogenic activity. Using EM (Figure 1(b)), we find AΞ² fibrils in the presence of IgG2b; however, a mixture of AΞ² fibrils and nonfibrillar amorphous AΞ² structures was observed in the presence of 72D9. In support of our findings, a similar modification of the AΞ² aggregation pathway using antibody fragments is reported by three groups, who proposed that antibody fragments withdraw AΞ²Os from the AΞ² amyloid fibril-forming pathway, maintaining them in nonfibrillar amorphous structures [25β€“28]. From a structural viewpoint, it has been shown that bapineuzumab captures AΞ² in a monomeric helical conformation at the N-terminus [29]. Another intracerebral sequestration of AΞ² in a monomeric state to prevent further AΞ² assembly and related neurotoxicity is also reported by m266.2, a parent of the humanized monoclonal antibody solanezumab [22]. However, these two mechanisms are not the case for 72D9, because 72D9 does not recognize AΞ² monomers [17]. Thus, our data indicate that 72D9 prefers to lead AΞ²Os to form nonfibrillar amorphous structures in a chaperone-like manner, which allow AΞ²Os to exist in a nontoxic state. 3.2. Intracerebral Sequestration of AΞ²Os in a Nontoxic StateFrom the abovementioned functional viewpoint on AΞ²Os, we further characterized the antitoxic activity of 72D9 in vitro. SH-5YSY cells were incubated at 37Β°C for 24β€‰h with 12.5β€‰ΞΌM seed-free AΞ²42 with or without antibodies. Compared with vehicle treatment, LDH assay of SH-SY5Y cells revealed significant neuronal death in the presence of nonspecific IgG2b (Figure 2(a)). In contrast, monoclonal 72D9 afforded nearly complete blockade of the neurotoxicity of the peptide assembly in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2(a)), which is in good agreement with our previous finding [17]. Regarding this action, in vitro experiments demonstrated that conformation-dependent antibodies [30β€“35] and their fragments [28] successfully immunoneutralized the toxicity of AΞ²Os. Presently, there is no evidence that antibody-AΞ²O interactions induce nontoxic conformational changes. In our previous experiment [17], sortilin is upregulated in the presence of AΞ²Os, and sortilin-p75NTR receptors are formed on neuronal membranes; however, the downregulation of sortilin and the dissociation of sortilin from p75NTR occur by the direct sequestration of AΞ²Os in the presence of 72D9. Through this mechanism, extracellular AΞ²Os appear to be maintained in a nontoxic state when complexed with 72D9. To further assess the above issue, we reevaluated the brains of the mice with improved cognition that received 72D9 immunotherapy [17]. Of note, we found that 72D9 decorated neurons in the brain parenchyma of 3x-Tg AD mice at 26 months of age (Figure 2(b)); this was not the case in the control IgG2b-immunized 3x-Tg AD mice of the same age (Figure 2(c)). Thus, some 72D9 got across BBB and directly immunoneutralized AΞ²Os in the brain parenchyma. Triple labeling analysis revealed that 72D9 and A11 immunofluorescences overlap in the cytosol of neurons, indicating that 72D9 can be internalized into neurons together with AΞ²Os (Figure 2(b)). Tampellini et al. [36] showed that anti-AΞ² antibodies bind to the extracellular AΞ² domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are internalized together with APP, followed by the clearance of intraneuronal AΞ² via the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Since 72D9 does not cross-react with APP [17], another yet unknown mechanism drives this internalization. Of note, most of the 72D9-negative pyramidal neurons exhibited atypical, eccentric large nuclei with abnormal chromatin morphology and distributions, features indicative of impending neuronal degeneration (Figure 2(e)). Such abnormalities were less evident in the 72D9-positive pyramidal neurons (Figure 2(d)), indicating that internalized AΞ²O as a complex with 72D9 appears to be maintained in a nontoxic state. Although the precise mechanisms for resolving this issue should be clarified in future studies, note that 72D9 can sequester both extracellular and intraneuronal AΞ²Os in a nontoxic state.
