<abstract>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by the concurrence of accumulation of abnormal aggregates composed of two proteins: Amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau, and of cellular changes including neurite degeneration and loss of neurons and cognitive functions. Based on their strong association with disease, genetically and pathologically, it is not surprising that there has been a focus towards developing therapies against the aggregated structures. Unfortunately, current therapies have but mild benefit. With this in mind we will focus on the relationship of synaptic plasticity with Aβ and tau protein and their role as potential targets for the development of therapeutic drugs. Finally, we will provide perspectives in developing a multifactorial strategy for AD treatment.

1. ntroduction

myloid eta: he herapeutic trategy. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is histopathologically characterized by extraneuronal amyloid-beta protein (AΞ²) deposits. Historically, AΞ² has been related to cell toxicity and genetic evidence provides the basis for its proposal as the primary cause of the disease [1, 2]. Supporting these hypotheses, impairment in AΞ² clearance by the central nervous system (CNS) has been reported in AD patients [3]. In cultured neurons, AΞ² was shown to activate apoptotic pathways, leading to caspase activation, ultimately contributing to neurodegeneration [4]. It was also found that AΞ² can activate apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) that is required for ROS- and ER-stress-induced JNK activation and apoptosis, mainly through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but not through endoplasmic-reticulum-(ER-) mediated stress [2, 5]. AΞ² has been found to modulate redox factor-1 that plays crucial roles in both cell death signaling pathways and DNA repair by interacting with transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-kappaB, and p53 and directly participating in the cleavage of apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA lesions, therefore affecting both the cell death signaling pathways and DNA repair [6]. Furthermore, AΞ² was responsible for inducing oxidative stress, predominantly via mitochondria, which also affected cholesterol balance [7] and can cause neurotoxicity due to production of free radicals [8].The proposed mechanism for AΞ² to exert the neurotoxic effects was the assembly into AΞ² plaques and oligomers [9]. This was further nurtured by the finding of a genetic component associated to the hypothesis of AΞ² deposition. Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that facilitate its cleavage to generate amyloid peptide and/or mutations in presenilin-1 (PS-1) or presenilin-2 (PS-2), that promote amyloid peptide formation and consequently AΞ² deposition have also been reported [10β€“12]. Although the genetic component is documented, we have to mention that far less than 1% of the worldwide AD cases are based on APP or PS mutations. Indeed, in a systematic genetic study of AD patients in a Latin American population, PS and APP mutations were absent [13].AΞ²-containing plaques have been classified into subtypes, such as senile, diffuse, and neuritic [14], with diffuse plaques having little impact on cognitive function, whereas neuritic plaques are associated with cognitive decline [15]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that diffuse plaques appear during early preclinical stages of the disease with later appearance of neuritic plaques. However the β€�peptide to plaqueβ€� model remains debated [16]. In recent years, other stages of AΞ² aggregation, beside plaques, seem to play a role in the development of AD [17]. In this regard it has been shown that the AΞ² aggregation/oligomerization process is playing a central role in pathogenesis; in other words, one soluble AΞ² molecule (monomer) interacts with other AΞ² monomers to form dimers, oligomers, and polymers, each state of aggregations forming a potentially pathogenic entity. Indeed, different states of soluble aggregates have been strongly related to synaptic loss and cognitive impairment [18], a topic that we will discuss later. From these data, the aggregation state (i.e., the different oligomers) seems to be related to the disease. Given that, disaggregation of a plaque will lead to an increase of AΞ² monomers/oligomers and therefore could cause neurotoxicity. Furthermore, inhibiting the formation of aggregates will preserve monomeric or polymeric structures and, therefore, could cause neurotoxicity. Overall, the perceived strength of the amyloid cascade hypothesis is reflected in the scientific literature, which is voluminous and dominated by experimental studies that adhere to the following statement: AΞ² accumulates in the AD brain, consequently leading to neurodegeneration [19]. Although spatial distribution of increased levels of AΞ² is related to AD pathology [20] and some degree of correlation with neuronal loss has been reported [21], no strong clinical correlation between plaque deposition and the degree of cognitive decline during AD has been found [22]. It is therefore in question whether the AΞ² plaque is responsible for all the damage seen during the process of neurodegeneration or not.


An Alternative Point of ViewWe have suggested that AΞ² deposition as plaques could represent the effect rather than the cause of AD [23, 24]. AΞ² aggregation may not be a harbinger of death, but rather a protective response to neuronal insult [25]. And, perhaps most contrary to current thinking, due to the fact that there is a negative correlation between AΞ² deposition and oxidative damage [26], it has been proposed that diffuse amyloid plaques may be a compensatory response aimed at reducing oxidative stress [27β€“30]. If this hypothesis is correct, it means that AΞ² deposits are simply a compensatory response, explaining the failure of therapeutic approaches simply directed to removal of AΞ² plaques [31].

2. ²: he herapeutic arget
resently ² is one of the main therapeutic targets. n fact, immunization with ² was successful at removing ² from the brain. maging studies in  patients showed that immunization with ² decreased amyloid plaques in the brain; however, this had no effect on cognition [32]. n mouse models, immunization has cleared small deposits and diffuses ² surrounding fibrillar cores [33]. ut beyond removing ², immunization has failed to clearly improve cognition in patients [34]. ctive vaccination with ² in patients with mild-to-moderate  in a phase  trial showed  inflammatory response [35], that was blamed for the failure. owever, the inflammatory response has not been definitively proven to be the cause for the failure. espite this outcome, new vaccines are presently in trial: li illy's solanezumab and anssen and fizer's bapineuzumab (originally developed by the ublin-based company lan), are using monoclonal antibodies that work with the immune system, binding to amyloid-² and helping to clear accumulated amyloid-² peptides in the brain. oth are being tested in phase  trials on thousands of participants with mild-to-moderate lzheimer's disease [36]. ollowing the hypothesis of preventing aggregates, ²-secretase and ³-secretase inhibitors have also been used therapeutically, but with mixed results due to inhibition of other vital pathways, for example, the otch pathway [37]. lthough the main goal is to block the production of ² [37], ³-secretase inhibitors also block the proteolytic processing and function of otch, which is essential for brain morphogenesis, making ³-secretase a worthwhile but difficult target for intervention [38]. n sum, the therapeutic outcome of current ²-related trials is rather discouraging. hile there are without a doubt multiple factors that could explain a negative outcome of these trials, the above hypothesis raises the possibility that ² plaques are not a viable primary therapeutic target. verall, there is little debate about ² being involved in  pathology, but a strong debate about whether it is an appropriate therapeutic target.2. AΞ²: The Therapeutic Target
Presently AΞ² is one of the main therapeutic targets. In fact, immunization with AΞ² was successful at removing AΞ² from the brain. Imaging studies in AD patients showed that immunization with AΞ² decreased amyloid plaques in the brain; however, this had no effect on cognition [32]. In mouse models, immunization has cleared small deposits and diffuses AΞ² surrounding fibrillar cores [33]. But beyond removing AΞ², immunization has failed to clearly improve cognition in patients [34]. Active vaccination with AΞ² in patients with mild-to-moderate AD in a phase II trial showed CNS inflammatory response [35], that was blamed for the failure. However, the inflammatory response has not been definitively proven to be the cause for the failure. Despite this outcome, new vaccines are presently in trial: Eli Lilly's solanezumab and Janssen and Pfizer's bapineuzumab (originally developed by the Dublin-based company Elan), are using monoclonal antibodies that work with the immune system, binding to amyloid-Ξ² and helping to clear accumulated amyloid-Ξ² peptides in the brain. Both are being tested in phase III trials on thousands of participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease [36]. Following the hypothesis of preventing aggregates, Ξ²-secretase and Ξ³-secretase inhibitors have also been used therapeutically, but with mixed results due to inhibition of other vital pathways, for example, the Notch pathway [37]. Although the main goal is to block the production of AΞ² [37], Ξ³-secretase inhibitors also block the proteolytic processing and function of Notch, which is essential for brain morphogenesis, making Ξ³-secretase a worthwhile but difficult target for intervention [38]. In sum, the therapeutic outcome of current AΞ²-related trials is rather discouraging. While there are without a doubt multiple factors that could explain a negative outcome of these trials, the above hypothesis raises the possibility that AΞ² plaques are not a viable primary therapeutic target. Overall, there is little debate about AΞ² being involved in AD pathology, but a strong debate about whether it is an appropriate therapeutic target.

3. au rotein: he herapeutic pproach
au is an axonal protein that regulates microtubule stability [39]. ccording to current  hypotheses, (a) tau becomes abnormally phosphorylated, (b) dissociates from microtubules and, (c) aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (s) [40, 41]. au has at least 45 phosphorylation sites, most of them are located in the proline-rich region (-region) (residues 172β€“251) and the -terminal tail region (-region) (residues 368β€“441) [42]. au phosphorylation at both of these regions affects its capacity to interact with microtubules [43]. n terms of  development, the phosphorylation sites located in the -terminal region seem to play an interesting role. hosphorylation at er262 selectively impairs binding of tau to microtubules [44]. hosphorylation at er202 enhances tau polymerization; phosphorylation at the two neighbouring sites er202-hr205 makes filament formation more sensitive to small changes in tau concentration [45]. aking these data together, it seems that multiple phosphorylation events of tau, rather than just singular phosphorylation, play a crucial role during -related tau pathology [46, 47]. 
he abnormal phosphorylation of tau during  is either related to an increase in kinase activity (glycogen synthase kinase 3², cyclin-dependent kinase-5, p42/44  kinase, p38 , stress-activated protein kinases, mitotic protein kinases) and/or a decrease in phosphatase activity (protein phosphatases 1, 2a, 2b) [48β€“52]. ertainly one kinase known to be of importance to tau phosphorylation is 3² [53]. n terms of phosphatase deregulation, it has been shown that protein phosphatases 1, 2, 2, and 5 dephosphorylate tau in vitro at sites er199, er202, hr205, hr212, er214, er235, er262, er396, er404, and er409 [54]. f all phosphatases, 2 was found to be the strongest tau-related phosphatase [54].3. Tau Protein: The Therapeutic Approach
Tau is an axonal protein that regulates microtubule stability [39]. According to current AD hypotheses, (a) tau becomes abnormally phosphorylated, (b) dissociates from microtubules and, (c) aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) [40, 41]. Tau has at least 45 phosphorylation sites, most of them are located in the proline-rich region (P-region) (residues 172β€“251) and the C-terminal tail region (C-region) (residues 368β€“441) [42]. Tau phosphorylation at both of these regions affects its capacity to interact with microtubules [43]. In terms of AD development, the phosphorylation sites located in the C-terminal region seem to play an interesting role. Phosphorylation at Ser262 selectively impairs binding of tau to microtubules [44]. Phosphorylation at Ser202 enhances tau polymerization; phosphorylation at the two neighbouring sites Ser202-Thr205 makes filament formation more sensitive to small changes in tau concentration [45]. Taking these data together, it seems that multiple phosphorylation events of tau, rather than just singular phosphorylation, play a crucial role during AD-related tau pathology [46, 47]. 
The abnormal phosphorylation of tau during AD is either related to an increase in kinase activity (glycogen synthase kinase 3Ξ², cyclin-dependent kinase-5, p42/44 MAP kinase, p38 MAPK, stress-activated protein kinases, mitotic protein kinases) and/or a decrease in phosphatase activity (protein phosphatases 1, 2a, 2b) [48β€“52]. Certainly one kinase known to be of importance to tau phosphorylation is GSK3Ξ² [53]. In terms of phosphatase deregulation, it has been shown that protein phosphatases PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP5 dephosphorylate tau in vitro at sites Ser199, Ser202, Thr205, Thr212, Ser214, Ser235, Ser262, Ser396, Ser404, and Ser409 [54]. Of all phosphatases, PP2A was found to be the strongest tau-related phosphatase [54].

4. herapeutic trategy
 au phosphorylation is established as a major factor during  with a therapeutic focus on its kinases and phosphatases [55, 56]. ecently, it was reported that sodium selenate was able to reduce tau phosphorylation by stabilizing 2, therefore, mitigating tau pathology in transgenic  models [57]. argeting 2, several neuroleptics (such as chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, and clozapine) have also been suggested for  treatment [58]. n an approach, parallel to prevent ² plaque formation, drugs that prevent tau aggregation have also been developed [59, 60]. t the end, the answer is quite the same: no proven success has yet emerged from these approaches.
4.1. ynaptic lasticity: he ink4.1.1. ynaptic lasticity and inases. Synaptic plasticity has been proposed to play a central role in brain capacity to incorporate transient experiences into persistent memory traces. Synaptic transmission can be enhanced (long-term potentiation, LTP) or depressed (long-term depression, LTD) by activity, and these changes can range from seconds to hours and days [61, 62]. Importantly, the affected intracellular pathways leading to LTP or LTD activation involve several kinases, such as GSK3Ξ², SRC family tyrosine kinases, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and, in particular, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II [63, 64], which are known to play a role in AD. Given the importance of synaptic plasticity, it is not surprising that these phenomena could be affected during neurodegeneration and AD [65]. Presently, there is growing evidence that AΞ² and tau are involved in synaptic dysfunction [66, 67]. Reports had placed AΞ² close to synaptic terminals [68]. Indeed, AΞ² was found to enhance N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function by direct interaction [69]. AΞ² was also found responsible for changes in presynaptic mechanism at the CA1β€“CA3 synapse of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus [70] and for functional deficits in the mossy fibre pathway [71]. Furthermore, AΞ² leads to decreased mitochondria in dendrites that resulted in the reduction in the number of spines or synapses [72, 73] and has been related to neuritic degeneration [74]. In the context of synaptic plasticity, AΞ² leads to impairment of LTP [75] and facilitates LTD [76, 77]. Of note, AΞ² has been suggested to exacerbate synaptic mitochondrial alterations including increased oxidative stress, decreased respiration, and compromised calcium handling capacity [78], all of them having an impact on synaptic plasticity. Overall, there is growing evidence showing that AΞ² is related to changes in synaptic function.4.1.2. Phosphorylation as the LinkThe critical question to raise at this point is how AΞ² and tau are interconnected during the disease. Although the relationship between these two proteins remains vague, data has lent support to the hypothesis that phosphorylation of tau protein could be the key linking mechanism. Ten years ago it was found that AΞ² fibrils accelerate the formation of abnormally phosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in a tau transgenic mouse [79]. The following years, it was reported that AΞ² could induce tau phosphorylation and toxicity in cultured septal cholinergic neurons [80]. More recently, it has been shown that AΞ² oligomers cause abnormal tau phosphorylation and morphology changes of spines by missorting of endogenous tau into dendrites [81]. Finally, natural AΞ² isolated from AD brains is sufficient to induce AD-type tau phosphorylation and, consequently, neuritic dystrophy [74]. Concerning synaptic plasticity, it has been found that the absence of tau protein inhibits the impairment of LTP and neurotoxicity caused by AΞ² [82] and targeting tau by immunotherapy prevents cognitive decline in a tangle mouse model [83]. Additionally, recent data show that tau protein has a dendritic function in targeting the Src kinase Fyn to postsynaptic NMDA receptors [84]. Summarizing these data, it appears that synaptic failure and neurotoxicity induced by AΞ² require tau phosphorylation. Not surprisingly, elimination of tau has been suggested as a therapeutic target in order to ameliorate disease progression [85]. However, neuronal alterations that underlie symptoms of AD are not exclusively due to a direct toxic effect of AΞ² [24]. Furthermore, we do not know the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex changes of synaptic plasticity during AD. Just recently, we have found that tau protein has a physiological function at the synaptic terminal that is regulated by tau phosphorylation (unpublished data). Therefore, simply getting rid of tau protein as some have suggested could adversely affect the equilibrium of different forms of synaptic plasticity. The question remains: is synaptic plasticity the link between AΞ² and tau? Clearly, the potency to look at AD from a synaptic perspective is that it integrates AΞ² and tau in a functional concept.

Conclusion and Perspectives
Pathogenesis of AD comprises neurodegeneration in the hippocampal area of brain that is critically involved in learning and memory. Presently, synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD), the process by which synapses modulate their connections with other neurons, seems to be playing an important role in response to injury and disease. But more importantly, emerging evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction beside neuronal death is leading to cognitive failure associated with AD. In fact, parts of AD pathogenesis could be explained by a loss of synaptic plasticity. In this regard, a growing amount of data is showing that AΞ² and tau protein are both necessary to cause changes in synaptic plasticity. However, the question remains: should either AΞ² or tau be the therapeutic targets? The concept that aggregation of AΞ² and tau is deleterious to cells and amenable to therapeutic molecules may be too simplistic. Instead, upstream and downstream targets have to emerge as therapeutic options. In this context, synaptic plasticity modulators could be an interesting target. The most important aspect of this approach is that synaptic plasticity links AΞ² and tau to the synaptic terminal. In this regard, some molecules have already been tested. Memantine, for example, is a partial antagonist of NMDA-receptor function, approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment within the USA and Europe (under the brand name Namenda (Forest), Axura and Akatinol (Merz), and Ebixa and Abixa (Lundbeck)), has some promise [86, 87]. Memantine, in its current therapeutic form, only slows down the neuronal degeneration process, but does not improve cognitive function [88]. However, Memantine might be beneficial to modulate the NMDA-receptor response in earlier stages of AD, where synaptic plasticity rather than neurotoxicity is playing a role. Furthermore, another target for therapeutic intervention would be Fyn kinase, a member of the Src kinase family, which is intricately involved with potentiating NMDA-receptor-dependent transmission [89]. Fyn kinase is receptive to changes in intracellular tau and extracellular AΞ² at the synaptic terminal [84, 90]. Therefore, drugs that directly regulate Fyn activity might be beneficial. Like Fyn, there are other targets critically involved during synaptic plasticity and AD, as previously mentioned. One such target is GSK3Ξ², which is necessary for the induction of synaptic LTD, while at the same time inhibits LTP [91].
In summary, it appears that the balance in synaptic plasticity during AD is tipped toward the induction of LTD. Hence, drugs that enhance LTP in combination with drugs that reduce induction of LTD might be of great value to treat AD. This therapeutic approach (i.e., simultaneously targeting critical check points for synaptic plasticity) will hopefully improve memory formation during AD (Figure 1). In sum, it is becoming all the clearer that approaches that focus on removing the pathological manifestations of AD might miss the intended outcome. Therefore, working with the biology of AD offers new hope for effective therapeutics.
