Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by adrenergic induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardias and associated with sudden cardiac death. The human cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) was linked to CPVT. A 20-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of recurrent syncope after physical and emotional stress. Routine cardiac examinations including catheterization revealed no structural abnormality. Exercise on treadmill induced premature ventricular contraction in bigeminy and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia was induced during isoproterenol infusion. Beta-blocking drug was effective in suppressing the arrhythmias. We performed genetic screening by PCR-SSCP method followed by DNA sequencing, and a novel missense mutation R2401H in RyR2 located in FKBP12.6 binding region was identified. This mutation was not detected in 190 healthy controls. Since FKBP12.6 plays a critical role in Ca channel gating, the R2401H mutation can be expected to alter Ca-induced Ca release and E-C coupling resulting in CPVT. This is the first report of RyR2 mutation in CPVT patient from Asia including Japan.
