<abstract>
The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients. There was an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month. The mechanism producing this weight loss is uncertain, but a central anorexigenic effect may be an important factor.
