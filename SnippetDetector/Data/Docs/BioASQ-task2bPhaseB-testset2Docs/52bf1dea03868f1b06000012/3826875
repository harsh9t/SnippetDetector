Crib-biting in horses is a repetitive behavior pattern which may involve the activation of both narcotic receptors and dopamine receptors in the CNS. Crib-biting frequency, determined in 7 nontreated horses under controlled conditions, was usually linear for many hours and ranged from 0.3 to 14.9 bites/min. Intravenous or IM injections of narcotic antagonists decreased these rates to almost zero by about 20 minutes after the injection was given. The duration of the response to a single injection ranged from 20 minutes for naloxone to 4 hours or more for nalmefene and diprenorphine. Effective doses were 0.02 to 0.04 mg of naloxone/kg, 0.04 mg of naltrexone/kg, 0.08 mg of nalmefene/kg, and 0.02 to 0.03 mg of diprenorphine/kg. Crib-biting could be prevented completely for up to a week by continuous infusion of 5 to 10 mg of nalmefene/hr. Crib-biting resumed when the infusion was discontinued, and plasma nalmefene concentrations decreased to below 5 ng/ml. Doses of nalmefene as large as 0.4 mg/kg, IV, produced only minor side effects. These side effects included some passage of semifluid fecal material, intermittent penile relaxation, and mild sedation. Treated horses responded normally to external stimuli, retained their appetites, and performed appropriately when ridden. Sedation wore off during the course of prolonged infusions. Narcotic antagonists may provide a novel and effective treatment of stereotypic behavior disorders.
