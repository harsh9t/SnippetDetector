Modifiers of position-effect-variegation in Drosophila are thought to encode proteins that are either structural components of heterochromatin or enzymes that modify these components. We have recently shown that a sequence motif found in one Drosophila modifier gene, Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), is conserved in a wide variety of animal and plant species (Singh et al. 1991). Using this motif, termed chromo box, we have cloned a mouse candidate modifier gene, M31, that also shows considerable sequence homology to Drosophila HP1. Here we report evidence of at least four independently segregating loci in the mouse homologous to the M31 cDNA. One of these loci--Cbx-rs1--maps to the X Chromosome (Chr), 1 cM proximal to Amg and outside the X-inactivation center region.
