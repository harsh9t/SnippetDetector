Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of preventable death and serious morbidity, with subsequent low cerebral blood flow (CBF) considered to be associated with poor prognosis. In the present study, we demonstrated the effect of the free radical scavenger edaravone on regional CBF (rCBF) after TBI. Male mice (C57/BL6) were subjected to TBI using a controlled cortical impactor device. Immediately after TBI, the animals were intravenously administered 3.0 mg/kg of edaravone or a vehicle saline solution. Two-dimensional rCBF images were acquired before and 24 h post-TBI, and were quantified in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres (n = 5 animals per group). CBF in the vehicle-treated animals decreased broadly over the ipsilateral hemisphere, with the region of low rCBF spreading from the frontal cortex to the occipital lobe. The zone of lowest rCBF matched that of the contusion area. The mean rCBF at 24 h for a defined elliptical region between the bregma and lambda was 73.7 ± 5.8 %. In comparison, the reduction of rCBF in edaravone-treated animals was significantly attenuated (93.4 ± 5.7 %, p < 0.05). The edaravone-treated animals also exhibited higher rCBF in the contralateral hemisphere compared with that seen in -vehicle-treated animals. It is suggested that edaravone reduces neuronal damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by maintaining intact the autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature.
