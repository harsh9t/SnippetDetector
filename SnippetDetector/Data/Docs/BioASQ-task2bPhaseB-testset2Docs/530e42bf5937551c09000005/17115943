<abstract>
Edaravone (MCI-186) is a novel synthetic free radical scavenger intended to have neuroprotective effect against ischemic insult. It is currently used on patients with cerebral infarction. Here, we note beneficial pharmaceutical effects of edaravone in rat experimental traumatic brain injury. Under specific experimental conditions, edaravone minimized traumatic brain injury by functioning as a synthetic antioxidant. Clinical trials testing the efficacy of edaravone are warranted.
