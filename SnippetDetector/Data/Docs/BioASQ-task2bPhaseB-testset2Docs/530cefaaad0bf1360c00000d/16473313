Williams syndrome (WS) is a well-known microdeletion syndrome characterized by specific facial features, retardation in growth and development, typical personality and cardiac defects. Poor growth potential is further affected by central precocious puberty (CPP) which is frequent in these patients. A WS patient with CPP is presented, whose pubertal development and bone age progression were arrested by administration of GnRH analogues. The case is reported to discuss the role of GnRH analogues for management of CPP in patients with WS.
