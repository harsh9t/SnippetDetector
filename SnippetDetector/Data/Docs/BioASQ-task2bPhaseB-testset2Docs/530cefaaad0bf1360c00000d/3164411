Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) may occur as an isolated autosomal dominant trait or as a feature of Williams syndrome. It has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome. We have excluded calcitonin as a candidate gene for SVAS using a gene specific probe.
