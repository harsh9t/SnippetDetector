As more and more genomes are being explored and annotated, important features of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are just being uncovered. In the light of what we know about Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, we will present the latest findings on this topic. The PcG proteins are well-conserved chromatin factors that repress transcription of numerous target genes. They bind the genome at specific sites, forming chromatin domains of associated histone modifications as well as higher-order chromatin structures. These 3D chromatin structures involve the interactions between PcG-bound regulatory regions at short- and long-range distances, and may significantly contribute to PcG function. Recent high throughput "Chromosome Conformation Capture" (3C) analyses have revealed many other higher order structures along the chromatin fiber, partitioning the genomes into well demarcated topological domains. This revealed an unprecedented link between linear epigenetic domains and chromosome architecture, which might be intimately connected to genome function.
