Central pontine and extra-pontine myelinolysis are a well known complication of hyponatremia. Other causes may be present. We report a case of head injury in a 13 year-old girl, who recovered well after surgery for extra-dural hematoma, but presented endocrinological disorders with hyperglycemia followed by a severe hyponatremia. Despite the correction of these metabolic disorders, the patient became comatose, and MRI, on T2 weighted image, showed hyperintense signals in the basal ganglia consistent with extra-pontine myelinolysis. The patient's state remained unchanged for six weeks. Since S. Konno and H. Wakui published cases of myelinolysis who dramatically improved after TRH treatment, the patient was given 0.6 mg i.v daily of TRH for six weeks. Improvement began within a few days, and continued until complete recovery.
