Patients suffering from severe cranio-cerebral trauma show alterations of the secretory patterns of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and human growth hormone (HGH) which may be of prognostic significance. We studied 10 patients following severe brain injury and prospectively compared a new synthetic human growth hormone releasing factor (HGHRF) test with the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) test. On admission, all patients had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 or 4. All patients had a low T3 syndrome. In the patients who died the TSH response after stimulation with TRH was also absent. In the patients who survived a significant TSH increase was observed (p less than 0.05). In comparison to the patients who died those who survived showed a significant (p less than 0.001) HGH increase after HGHRF stimulation. This test might be useful as an additional tool in establishing early prognosis in patients with severe brain injury.
