The typical patient with post-traumatic hypopituitarism is a young adult male presenting months to years after an automobile accident, following which he was unconscious for several days. He will probably have sustained a fracture of the base of the skull and on recovery is likely to have permanent visual or other neurological sequelae. Temporary or permanent diabetes insipidus may have occurred. The features of panhypopituitarism such as weight loss, fatigue, faintness, loss of libido, and impotence may have been ascribed to depression or the "postconcussion syndrome" and often inappropriate treatment and rehabilitation advised. The striking feature on review of the literature is that the pathological consequences of head injury to the pituitary and hypothalamus have been well described, while only 47 cases of traumatic hypopituitarism have been reported. The most likely reason for this disparity is that head injury of sufficient severity to cause hypothalamic and pituitary damage commonly led to death. More patients now survive, owing to the availability of intensive care; accordingly, most cases have been reported in the last 15 years. However, several patients are described in whom the initiating head injury was not associated with a skull fracture or followed by coma. We recommend that patients with major head injury (defined by post-traumatic amnesia greater than 24 hours), and in particular those with fractures of the base of the skull or diabetes insipidus should be closely monitored for symptoms and signs of endocrine dysfunction and appropriate dynamic pituitary-function tests performed.
