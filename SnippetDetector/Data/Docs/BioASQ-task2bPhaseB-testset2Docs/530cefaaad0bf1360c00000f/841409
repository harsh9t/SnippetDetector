<abstract>
Regurgitation of food by rumination has rarely been reported in latency-age children. A 7-year-old boy had symptoms of rumination, gagging, bruxism, and enuresis. During the oppositional stage of development many unresolved conflicts had developed between the patient and his parents. Short-term psychotherapy which focused on resolution of the power struggles produced rapid remission of the symptoms. A two-year follow-up showed no recurrence of difficulty.
