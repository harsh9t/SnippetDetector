<abstract>
T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is an extremely uncommon haematological malignancy that has an aggressive course and a grave prognosis. We describe a patient who presented with lymphocytosis, scalp erythema, ascites and splenomegaly and was diagnosed with T-PLL. He was treated with alemtuzumab with a good response and was referred for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
