Prolymphocytic leukemia is a rare chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that includes two subtypes, B cell and T cell, each with its own distinct clinical, laboratory and pathological features. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia has an aggressive course with short median survival and poor response to chemotherapy. With the use of the purine analogue pentostatin more than half of patients will have a major response and a minority will have a complete remission, usually lasting months. With the introduction of alemtuzumab, most patients who progressed despite treatment with pentostatin had a major response with a complete remission rate higher than that obtained with pentostatin when used as a first line. Unfortunately, progression still follows shortly. We recommend alemtuzumab as initial therapy and offer stem cell transplant (SCT) to selected young, healthy patients who respond. Although B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is also a progressive disease, some patients can achieve a prolonged progression-free-survival with fludarabine. Patients presenting with massive splenomegaly may be effectively palliated with splenic irradiation or splenectomy. Rituximab is a promising agent and further investigations are warranted to better define its role in treatment of this disorder.
