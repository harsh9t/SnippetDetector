T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare mature T cell lymphoproliferative disease. It has been associated with an aggressive course, a poor response to conventional chemotherapy and a short median survival. Here we present a rare case of concurrent T-PLL and Kaposi sarcoma who achieved a complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after a very short course of treatment with alemtuzumab. A review of T-PLL was done. In this review, clinical features, laboratory features and current therapeutic strategies of T-PLL are presented.
