Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a painful burning or stinging sensation affecting the tongue or other areas of the mouth without obvious signs of an organic cause on physical examination. A burning mouth sensation can occur in several cutaneous or systemic diseases that must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome, since this term is used exclusively to refer to idiopathic forms and is included within the cutaneous sensory disorders. In most cases, patients with burning mouth syndrome have accompanying psychologic or psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the syndrome has traditionally been included among the psychogenic dermatoses. However, it is currently unclear whether psychologic factors are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome, or whether each exacerbates the other. Recent studies propose the etiology to be neurologic, either neuropathic or related to taste.
