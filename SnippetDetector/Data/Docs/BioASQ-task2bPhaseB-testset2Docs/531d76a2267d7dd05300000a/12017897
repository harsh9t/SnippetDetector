Burning sensation of the tongue is a common complaint. In some patients this is diagnosed as Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS). The prevalence of BMS is 0.8-19% of the general population. The typical complaint is localized to the anterior part of the tongue and may be accompanied by dry mouth sensation or taste disorder. The differential diagnosis of BMS is based on the specific details of the complaint, the clinical findings and laboratory results. The patients population consists of mainly post-menopausal women, even though it can appear in younger patients of both genders. The pathogenesis is only partially identified. There are different treatment approaches.
