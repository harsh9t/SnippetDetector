Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) or glossodynia is a chronic pain syndrome that mainly affects middle-aged/elderly women. This condition is probably of multifactorial origin, often idiopathic, and its etiopathogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Visible pathologic lesions of the oral mucosa or processes are usually not evident. Etiologic factors that have been reported include several disorders (e. g. hematologic disorders, denture factors, the climacteric, infections, endocrinological, neurological or psychiatric disorders). On the other hand psychological factors, such as anxiety, depression and phobias have been reported to play a significant role at the beginning of this nosological entity. BMS related to nutritional deficiency is uncommon. A systemic approach to assessment is essential and the opinion of other specialities, particularly internal medicine, dentistry or neurology, may be of help. Treatment is of the underlying cause but in many cases no specific aetiological factor is identified. Non-indicated substitution therapy of suspected but unproved deficiency states must be avoided. Treatment approaches were divided into topical and systemic strategies. However, there is little research evidence that provides clear guidance for those treating patients with BMS.
