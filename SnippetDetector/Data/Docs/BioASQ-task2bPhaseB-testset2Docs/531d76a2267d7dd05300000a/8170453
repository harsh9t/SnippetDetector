Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a distinct clinical entity characterized by a chief complaint of unremitting oral burning concomitant with no oral mucosal clinically observable lesions. Numerous causes of this condition have been suggested, including local factors, systemic factors, and psychogenic disorders. A total of 36 consecutive subjects, 32 women and 4 men, complaining of BMS, who had attended the Dental Clinic of the University of Ferrara during a period of 2 years, was studied. The method of assessment followed closely a strictly co-ordinated management protocol based on conventional guidelines, namely history, clinical examination and special investigations. A detailed history was taken of duration of the condition, site affected, and pattern of burning. The severity and the response to treatment were assessed with a Visual Linear Analogue Scale (VLAS). A full medical history was taken, with regard to xerostomia-inducing drug assumption. The presence and the severity of menopausal symptoms were explored. Inquiries were made on use of mouthwashes. For the denture-wearers, specific questioning was directed to the length of denture-wearing experience, temporal association of the symptom with the wearing of dentures, relationship to burning sensation of any relines or repairs, denture cleaning technique, and use of fixatives. A complete routine intraoral and extraoral examination was performed. The presence of parafunctional habits, such as tongue thrusting, clenching, grinding, lip and cheek biting, was investigated. If dentures were worn, their design and condition were examined. In particular, the relation between the vertical and horizontal components of the jaw and the denture base extension was assessed and the freeway space measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
