BACKGROUND: To compare different therapeutic supportive approaches in patients with burning mouth syndrome. A prospective study was carried out for this purpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 56 patients with burning mouth syndrome. They were randomly assigned to treatment with capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid or lysozyme-lactoperoxidase (test drugs) or boric acid (control group). Symptoms were scored after 60 days treatment and 60 days after drug discontinuation. RESULTS: At the end of the treatment period, there was a significant reduction in the symptom scores of all of the patients who received the test drugs (P<0.01), and at the end of the follow-up period in the test groups as a whole (P<0.01); the reduction was not significant when considering each test group separately after the treatment period. All of the treatments were more effective than boric acid and there was no significant difference in the symptom scores of the control group at either of the study time-points. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the similar effectiveness of capsaicin and alpha-lipoic acid in controlling the symptoms of burning mouth syndrome. Lysozyme-lactoperoxidase may be effective in the supportive care of BMS patients with xerostomia. The transitory effect observed after discontinuing drug administration justifies the use of prolonged therapy in chronically affected patients.
