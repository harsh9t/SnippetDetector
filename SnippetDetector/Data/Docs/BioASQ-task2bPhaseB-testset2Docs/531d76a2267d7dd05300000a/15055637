A commonly misdiagnosed condition, burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning sensations of the oral cavity in the absence of physical abnormalities of the oral mucosa. BMS affects middle-aged women predominantly. This condition has a multifactorial etiology, although several conditions have been associated with BMS, including depression/anxiety, hematinic deficiencies (iron, folate, and vitamin B complex), oral habits such as tongue thrusting and bruxism, and idiopathic BMS. Multiple approaches to treatment have been described in the literature, although few controlled clinical trials have been designed to determine their efficacy. This article examines BMS, its related factors, and treatment options available to the general dentist.
