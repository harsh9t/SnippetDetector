OBJECTIVES: To know the most important clinical features of Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) in our environment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study of 30 BMS patients, 29 female and 1 male, with a mean age of 60.2 years (range 37-89), was made. A previously designed clinical protocol, including blood counts, levadure culture, oral pH measurement and non-stimulated salivary flow rate, was completed by all patients. Comparative and descriptive statistical analysis was performed. The Chi-square test was applied (p< 0.05). RESULTS: Moreover of a burning sensation, 60 % of patients presented oral dryness and 60 % dysgeusia. The tongue was the most frequent site affected of burning sensation (66.7 %). Type II of BMS was the most common (53.3%). In women, 82.9 % were postmenopausal. A 13.3 % of patients suffered type II Diabetes, 6.7 % vitamin deficiency and 56.6 % used xerostomy-inducer medication. The 56.6 % of patients showed chronic anxiety and/or depression. The 46.7 % had a deficient oral hygiene level and 44.4 % wore inadequate dentures. Salivary flow rate was decreased in 50 % of patients. Significant levadure growth was not detected in any case. CONCLUSIONS: BMS patients in our environment are principally postmenopausal women, with tongue burning, xerostomy, dysgeusia and chronic anxiety and/or depression.
