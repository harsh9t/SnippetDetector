Though it has been the subject of much research, burning mouth syndrome--a chronic oral-facial pain condition that affects many U.S. adults--remains poorly understood. It has been associated with numerous oral and systemic conditions. Treatment options frequently include various medications. While patients with symptoms of BMS are more likely to seek care from physicians, dentists should be involved in the evaluation and management of these patients.
