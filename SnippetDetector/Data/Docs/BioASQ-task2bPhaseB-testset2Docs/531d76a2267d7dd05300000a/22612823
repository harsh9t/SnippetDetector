OBJECTIVE: To provide a review on the aetiology and therapeutic options for the management of patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). BACKGROUND: BMS is a chronic disorder that frequently affects women and is characterised by burning symptoms of the oral mucosa without clinical signs. This syndrome has a complex and multifactorial characteristics, but its aetiology remains unknown and this makes it difficult with regard to the treatment and management of such patients. Despite not being accompanied by evident organic changes and not presenting risks to health, BMS can significantly reduce the quality of life for patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The article reviews the literature regarding aetiologic factors, clinical implications and treatment of BMS. CONCLUSION: involvement of neurological, emotional and hormonal alterations is proposed in BMS aetiology. However the mechanisms of its development are complex and not completely understood. Tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines and antipsychotic drugs are the most accepted options in treatment and show variable results. The correct diagnosis of BMS and the exclusion of possible local or systemic factors that can be associated with the symptoms are fundamental. It is also important to evaluate the quality of life for these patients to recognise the potential impact of this condition on their lives.
