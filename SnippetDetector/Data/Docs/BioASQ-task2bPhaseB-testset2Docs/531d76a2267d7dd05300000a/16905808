Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) has been comparatively recently isolated as the separate nosologic diagnosis. This disease is characterized by the feeling of burning, dryness, numbness, pricking and seldom by pain in the tongue or mouth cavity area (palate, lips, alveoli) without any changes in mucous membrane. Absence of visible causes of the disease complicates its treatment and makes the patients to address the physicians of various profiles, often without any result. All the above stated made the authors to define the etiologic factors of various clinical versions of BMS and to carry out their differential diagnostics along with the development of pathogenetic therapy of BMS. 30 women of 40 to 70 year of age were examined. According to the anamnesis, BMS was developing gradually and in most cases it was associated with the aggravation of the existing disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, aggravation of climacteric state) or with deterioration of psycho-emotional sphere due to conflicting situation. The carried out studies enabled the authors to select and divide patients with BMS into groups according to clinical values and the etiologic factors. In most cases diverse clinical versions of the burning mouth syndrome are cause-and-effect expressions of various somatic diseases, the timely determination and adequate therapy of which give the best results in the struggle against BMS.
