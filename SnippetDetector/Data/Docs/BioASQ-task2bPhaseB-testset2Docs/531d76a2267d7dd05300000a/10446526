The BMS which involves the oral mucosa and produces sensations of pain and prickling is still poorly known by the physician. It differs from the other pathologies of the oral mucosa by its multifactorial etiology and by its high prevalence among postmenopausal women. The current treatments are somewhat disappointing and postmenopausal women suffering from BMS are advised to take a hormonal replacement therapy even though no direct relation between BMS and estrogen blood levels has been proved.
