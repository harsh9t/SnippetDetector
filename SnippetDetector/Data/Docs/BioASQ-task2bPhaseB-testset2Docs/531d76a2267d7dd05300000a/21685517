It should be emphasized that at the present stage there is no consensus achieved regarding the etiopathogenesis of BMS. Almost all researchers point to lots of factors, simultaneously participating in genesis and development of BMS and at the same time most of them agreed on one - psychological factors play a crucial role in formation and maintenance of painful sensations. The aim of the study was the identification of psychological or psychiatric deviations (changes) among the patients with BMS to perform an adequate differentiated therapy. Clinico-psychological examination (dentist, neurologist, psychiatrist) was carried out in 39 patients from 46 to 70 years of age. Among them women - 36 and men - 3. To identify clinical types of BMS a classification of P.J. Lamey (1996) was used and as a result, depression, insomnia, cancerophobia, severe neurologic disorders, phobic syndrome were revealed. Three main categories - a chronic somatoform dysfunction (23 cases), chronic vegetative disorders (8), and chronic pain phenomenon (12) were identified. Only in one case was revealed a paranoid syndrome. Alongside with the well-known scheme of treatment (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or neuroleptics) Psychotherapy was conducted, while EEG-feed back (Biofeed back, Neurofeed back) method was used for the first time. A number of important decisions were made the most important of which are the following: BMS - must be regarded as a psychosomatic problem rather than a psychiatric disorder. In addition to psychotherapy, using of EEG - feedback method greatly improved patients' condition and in 4 cases BMS clinical manifestations were evened-out completely.
