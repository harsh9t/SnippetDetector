The relationship between burning mouth syndrome and 48 variables was investigated in 241 patients, 45 years old and older, who had attended the Oral Medicine Clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Stellenbosch during a period of 4 years. A total of 85 cases of burning mouth syndrome were diagnosed in 65 women and 20 men. Statistically significant relationships (p < 0.05) were found with self-medication, xerostomia, and other salivary disturbances in both men and women with burning mouth syndrome when compared with their respective controls. Among the women with BMS, significant relationships were also found with anemia, inadequate diet, chronic infection, hormone therapy, ulcerative/erosive lesions, and atrophy. In contrast men with BMS showed statistically significant relationships between taking prescribed medication, central nervous system disturbances, gingivitis, and denture-related problems. In addition, significant associations were related to variables such as psychogenic factors, regurgitation, flatulence, and periodontitis.
