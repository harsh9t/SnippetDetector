Twenty-five patients with a diagnosis of nonorganic burning mouth syndrome were matched for age and sex with twenty-five patients with organically based painful disorders of the mouth. All patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist and completed the General Health Questionnaire to screen for psychiatric disorders. A diagnosis of psychiatric disorder based on clinical examination findings was made in 44% (11/25) of the patients with burning mouth syndrome and in 16% (4/25) of the controls.
