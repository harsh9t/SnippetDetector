Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by oral burning or similar pain in the absence of detectable oral mucosa changes. This condition is more common among middle-aged and elderly women. Although various local, systemic, and psychological factors are considered to be possible causes of BMS, it is still a challenge in the field of oral medicine. The aim of this review was to discuss several aspects of BMS, update current knowledge, and provide guidelines for patient management.
