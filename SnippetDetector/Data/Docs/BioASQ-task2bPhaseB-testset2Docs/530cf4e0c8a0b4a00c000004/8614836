A mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) was generated by the introduction of an Arg 403 --> Gln mutation into the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene. Homozygous alpha MHC 403/403 mice died 7 days after birth, and sedentary heterozygous alpha MHC 403/+ mice survived for 1 year. Cardiac histopathology and dysfunction in the alpha MHC 403/+ mice resembled human FHC. Cardiac dysfunction preceded histopathologic changes, and myocyte disarray, hypertrophy, and fibrosis increased with age. Young male alpha MHC 403/+ mice showed more evidence of disease than did their female counterparts. Preliminary results suggested that exercise capacity may have been compromised in the alpha MHC 403/+ mice. This mouse model may help to define the natural history of FHC.
