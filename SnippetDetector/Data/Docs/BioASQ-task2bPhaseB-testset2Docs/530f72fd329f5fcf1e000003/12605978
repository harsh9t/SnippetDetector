PURPOSE: To identify the characteristics of adult patients with newly diagnosed primary brain tumors associated with identifiable deficits in neuropsychologic function to target interventions to improve function and quality of life (QOL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with newly diagnosed primary brain tumors and their caregivers were enrolled and underwent a battery of standardized neuropsychologic tests, allowing for qualitative and quantitative assessment and sensitive to the effects of the brain tumor, QOL, or caregiver stress. RESULTS: We enrolled 68 patients with no prior radiotherapy. Patients with left hemisphere tumors reported significantly more memory problems and depressive symptoms. They also exhibited poorer attention and were more distractible, with poorer verbal fluency and poorer verbal learning. Patients with glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated poorer psychomotor speed and visual tracking than patients with non-glioblastoma multiforme histologic features. Patients and caregivers perceived QOL in a similar fashion, with significant correlation between patient and caregiver on hope testing and general QOL on the Linear Analog Self-Assessment Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with left hemisphere tumors and glioblastoma multiforme histologic features demonstrated testable differences in neuropsychologic function and QOL that may be amenable to improvement with medical therapy or tailored rehabilitation programs. Caregiver assessments can predict patient QOL, which may be useful in patients with declining status.
