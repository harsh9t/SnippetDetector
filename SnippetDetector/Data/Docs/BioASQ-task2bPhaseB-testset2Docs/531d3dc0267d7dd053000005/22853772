The sudden cardiac death (SCD) of an athlete is always a dramatic event, and one wonders if it could have been prevented by pre-participation cardiovascular screening. For years now, a pro/con debate has been taking place on the pre-participation screening of athletes: the method, who is responsible, cost-effectiveness, obligatory or voluntary screening. In this pro-article, which agrees with the "sudden cardiac death can be prevented by routinely pre-participation cardiovascular screening"-standpoint, the unique Italian experience is the best argument for the support of screening. This study clearly demonstrated a reduction in SCD in those athletes who were screened in accordance with Italian law.
