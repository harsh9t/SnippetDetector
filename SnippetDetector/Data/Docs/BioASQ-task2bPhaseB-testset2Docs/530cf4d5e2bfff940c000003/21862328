We report here the synthesis and SAR of a new series of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines as potent Tpl2 kinase inhibitors. The proposed binding mode suggests the potential flipped binding mode depending on the substitution. Biacore studies show evidence of binding of these molecules to the protein kinase. The kinome inhibition profile of these molecules suggests good selectivity.
