<abstract>
Evaluation of hit chemotypes from high throughput screening identified a novel series of 2,4-disubstituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridines as COT kinase inhibitors. Structural modifications exploring SAR at the 2- and 4-positions resulting in inhibitors with improved enzyme potency and cellular activity are disclosed.
