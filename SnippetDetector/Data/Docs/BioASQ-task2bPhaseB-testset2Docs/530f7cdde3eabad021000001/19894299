A rat model of big brain ischemia with the middle brain artery occlusion was used for the study of amantadine sulfate (PK-Merz) effect on the expression of Hsp70 measured with immunohistochemical method and Western blot 12 h and 4 days after surgery. The neuroprotective effect of PK-Merz associated with the enhancement of Hsp70 expression in ischemic stroke in rats. To confirm the multivector neuroprotective action of the drug, a comparative study of clinical effectiveness of PK-Merz and magnesium sulfate was carried out in 40 patients (20 patients in each group) in the most acute period of atherothrombotic and cardioembolic strokes. Patients treated with PK-Merz exhibited the more significant restoration of consciousness and better dynamics (regress) of neurological deficit with the most intensive restoration of neurological deficit in the first day that allows to recommend the use of amantadine sulfate in the first hours of ischemic stroke and for the prevention of reperfusion damage in recanalisation therapy of ischemic stroke.
