The rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we examined the association between TREM2 exon 2 variants and early-onset AD in a sample of Caucasian subjects of French origin including 726 patients with age of onset â‰¤65 years and 783 controls. Only the rs75932628-T variant (predicted to cause an R47H substitution) conferred a significant risk for early-onset AD (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.3 to 16.9; p = 0.009). These results confirm the association between this variant and AD and underline its involvement in early-onset cases.
