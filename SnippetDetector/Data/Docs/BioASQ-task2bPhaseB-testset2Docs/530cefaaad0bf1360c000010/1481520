<abstract>
A follow-up (1985, 1990, 1991) study revealed in female workers of hydroponic hothouses an increase of the incidence of nervous system diseases depending on the length of work (vegeto-vascular dystonia, angiodystonic syndromes, vegeto-sensory polyneuropathy). It is suggested that the main cause of nervous lesions in these cases was the complex effect of pesticides.
