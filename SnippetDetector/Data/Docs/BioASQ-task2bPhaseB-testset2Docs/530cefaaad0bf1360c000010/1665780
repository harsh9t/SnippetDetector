A 65-year-old woman who has been admitted after organophosphate-induced poisoning (Fenthion), develops pareses as a result of neuromuscular junctional dysfunction 7 days post-exposure. These findings are consistent with an intermediate syndrome, which may appear within 24 to 96 hours of exposure and subsides after 5 to 18 days. Delayed polyneuropathy develops within 1 to 3 weeks and abates after 6 to 12 months. A distal axonopathy can be demonstrated. Several authors have attempted EMG monitoring of pesticide-workers in agricultural and industrial settings. The electrophysiologic examination is an important diagnostic adjunct in the development and course of muscle paresis following organophosphate-ester poising.
