While the health of the general population is not adversely affected by the exposure the pesticides in food and environment, workers, who have during their occupation been intensely exposed to pesticides, exhibit a higher prevalence of slight neurotoxic symptoms. In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy.
