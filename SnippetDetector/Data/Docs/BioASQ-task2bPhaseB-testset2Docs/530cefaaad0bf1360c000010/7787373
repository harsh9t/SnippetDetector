This pilot-study should contribute to the question whether Pyrethroid intoxication can be distinguished from other diseases by characteristic clinical symptoms. The results show that the characteristics of the intoxication do not consist in singular symptoms but in combinations and correlations of symptoms, i.e. of central-neurological with peripheral- and autonomic-neurological as well as with characteristic immunological disturbances. Neurological symptoms consist in cerebro-organic disfunctions, locomotory disorders reminiscent of multiple sclerosis or M. Parkinson, and sensory, motoric and vegetative polyneuropathy, leading, for instance, to cardiovascular regulatory disorder like sympathicotonia or, orthostatic hypotonia. Non-neurological symptoms include immunosuppression with consecutive opportunistic infections, like candida albicans, most frequently of the alimentary tract, but also dermal and mucosal swellings, lichen-ruber-like efflorescences, loss of hair, conjunctivitis. Other symptoms are: hypoglycaemic crises inhibition of fertility, disturbances of blood clotting, and most frequently in children, suspected hematopoetic disorders.
