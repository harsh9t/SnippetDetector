Given the importance of agriculture and widespread use of pesticides, intoxication due to organophosphate insecticides is common in Turkey. Organophosphorus compounds may cause late-onset distal polyneuropathy occurring 2 or more weeks after the acute exposure. An 18-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were admitted to the hospital with weakness, paresthesia, and gait disturbances at 35 and 22 days, respectively, after ingesting dimethyl-2,2-dichloro vinyl phosphate (DDVP). Neurological examination revealed weakness, vibration sense loss, bilateral dropped foot, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilaterally positive Babinski sign. Electroneurography demonstrated distal motor polyneuropathy with segmental demyelination associated with axonal degeneration prominent in the distal parts of both lower extremities.
