<abstract>
Many organophosphorus compounds, including the organophosphate insecticides, may cause polyneuropathy of delayed onset. An exception is parathion, which has been considered the prototype of nonneurotoxic cholinesterase inhibitors. Nevertheless, we describe a patient with delayed polyneuropathy after suicidal ingestion of parathion.
