BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones) gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with > 10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10 year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for astrocytoma grade IV, but a survival benefit for astrocytoma grade I-II was observed which could be due to exposure-related tumour symptoms leading to earlier diagnosis and surgery in that patient group.
