Low efficiency of gene transfer is the main obstacle for a clinically effective gene therapy at the level of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell. Another important aspect of stem cell gene therapy, the actual expression of the transduced genes, has only been investigated adequately in very few studies, mainly for globin genes. Transcriptional silencing and position effects due to negative effects of surrounding chromatin on the expression of randomly integrated vector sequences may seriously jeopardize the success of current gene therapy strategies, even if transduction efficiency can be significantly improved. We propose the incorporation of chromatin insulators in the design of gene therapy vectors to overcome the problem of position effects. Chromatin insulators are protein-binding DNA elements that lack intrinsic promoter/enhancer activity but shelter genes from transcriptional influence of surrounding chromatin. The best characterized insulators are from Drosophila. We hypothesize that the important cellular function of chromatin organization is evolutionarily conserved and that human homologs to Drosophila insulator binding proteins such as the suppressor of Hairy-wing exist and can be cloned. Using these putative proteins, it should be possible to identify corresponding minimal binding sites with insulator activity. The design and incorporation of effective chromatin insulator sequences in the next generation of gene therapy vectors should lead to improved and more predictable expression of therapeutic transgenes and constitute an important step toward clinically effective gene therapy.
