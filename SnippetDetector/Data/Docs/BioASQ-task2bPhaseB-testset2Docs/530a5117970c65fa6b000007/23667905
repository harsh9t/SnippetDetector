Data analysis in proteomics is complex and with the extra challenges involved in the interpretation of data from N-terminomics experiments, this can be daunting.Therefore, we have devised a rational pipeline of steps to approach N-terminomics data analysis in a statistically based and valid manner. We have automated these steps in CLIPPER, an add-on to the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline(TPP). Applying CLIPPER to the analysis of N- terminomics data generated by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) enables high confidence peptide to protein assignment, protein N-terminal characterization and annotation, and for protease analysis readily allows protease substrate discovery with high confidence.
