Propionic acidemia is an inherited metabolic disease caused by the deficiency of the mitochondrial protein propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), one of the four biotin-dependent enzymes. PCC is a multimeric protein composed of two different alpha- and beta-PCC subunits, nuclearly encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively. Mutations in either gene cause the clinically heterogeneous disease propionic acidemia. In this work we describe the mutational analysis of PCCA and PCCB deficient patients from different European countries (Spain, Italy, Belgium, Croatia, and Austria) and from America (mainly USA). We report 24 novel PA mutations, nine affecting the PCCA gene and 15 affecting the PCCB gene. They include six missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, one point exonic mutation affecting splicing, seven splicing mutations affecting splice sequences, and nine short insertions or deletions, only two in-frame. We have found a highly heterogenous spectrum of PCCA mutations, most of the PCCA deficient patients are homozygous carrying a unique genotype. The PCCA mutational spectrum includes a high proportion of short insertions or deletions affecting one nucleotide. In the PCCA mutant alleles analyzed we have also found one single nucleotide change, a novel nonsynonymous SNP. On the other hand, the PCCB deficient patients carry a more reduced spectrum of mutations, 50% of them are missense. This work represents an extensive update of the mutational study of propionic acidemia providing important information about the worldwide distribution of PA mutations and representing another essential part in the study of the phenotype-genotype correlations for the prediction of the metabolic outcome and for the implementation of treatments tailored to each PA patient.
