<abstract>
Propionic acidemia can result from mutations in the PCCA or PCCB genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. We have developed a method based on complementation of the enzyme defect using a lipid-mediated transient transfection of the normal human PCCA or PCCB cDNA into primary fibroblasts. We demonstrate the reliability of this method for identification of the defective PCC gene in order to unequivocally approach the mutational analysis in the corresponding PCCA and PCCB genes.
