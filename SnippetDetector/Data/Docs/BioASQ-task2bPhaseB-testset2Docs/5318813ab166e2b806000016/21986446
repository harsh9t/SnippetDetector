Propionic acidemia is an organic acidemia that can lead to metabolic acidosis, coma and death, if not treated appropriately in the acute setting. Recent advancements in treatment have allowed patients with propionic acidemia to live beyond the neonatal period and acute presentation. The natural history of the disease is just beginning to be elucidated as individuals reach older ages. Recent studies have identified the genomic mutations in the genes PCCA and PCCB. However, as of yet no clear genotype-phenotype correlations are known. As patients age, the natural progression of propionic acidemia illuminates intellectual difficulties, increased risk for neurological complications, including stroke-like episodes, cardiac complications, and gastrointestinal difficulties, as well as a number of other complications. This article reviews the available literature for the natural history of propionic acidemia.
