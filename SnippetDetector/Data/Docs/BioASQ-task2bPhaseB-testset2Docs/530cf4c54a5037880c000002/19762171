The management of endotracheal tubes and nasal cannulae covers a large part of work time of nurses involved in the care of very preterm infants. These procedures, although continuously performed, have not yet been scientifically demonstrated. In fact, there is limited evidence regarding several points such as the frequency of endotracheal suctioning, the level of suction pressure, the duration of suctioning, the depth of catheter insertion, the sterility, and the use of normal saline during endotracheal suction. With regard to the nasal cannulae, there is a more recent use of this device consisting in delivering end-expiratory pressure or gas flow to reduce the frequency of apneas and desaturations in preterm infants or for the management of RDS. This approach is defined high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC). In this article, we review the literature on the airway management of intubated patients as well as of infants managed with nasal-CPAP or nasal cannulae. Potential fields of research on this topic are suggested.
