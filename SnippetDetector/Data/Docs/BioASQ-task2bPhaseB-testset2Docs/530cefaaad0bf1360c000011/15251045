<abstract>
BACKGROUND: Forces deployed to the first Gulf War report more ill health than veterans who did not serve there. Many studies of post-Gulf morbidity are based on relatively small sample sizes and selection bias is often a concern. In a setting where selection bias relating to the ill health of veterans may be reduced, we: i) examined self-reported adult ill health in a large sample of male UK Gulf War veterans and a demographically similar non-deployed comparison group; and ii) explored self-reported ill health among veterans who believed that they had Gulf War syndrome. METHODS: This study uses data from a retrospective cohort study of reproduction and child health in which a validated postal questionnaire was sent to all UK Gulf War veterans (GWV) and a comparison cohort of Armed Service personnel who were not deployed to the Gulf (NGWV). The cohort for analysis comprises 42,818 males who responded to the questionnaire. RESULTS: We confirmed that GWV report higher rates of general ill health. GWV were significantly more likely to have reported at least one new medical symptom or disease since 1990 than NGWV (61% versus 37%, OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5-2.8). They were also more likely to report higher numbers of symptoms. The strongest associations were for mood swings (OR 20.9, 95%CI 16.2-27.0), memory loss/lack of concentration (OR 19.6, 95% CI 15.5-24.8), night sweats (OR 9.9, 95% CI 6.5-15.2), general fatigue (OR 9.6, 95% CI 8.3-11.1) and sexual dysfunction (OR 4.6, 95%CI 3.2-6.6). 6% of GWV believed they had Gulf War syndrome (GWS), and this was associated with the highest symptom reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of reported ill health among GWV were confirmed. This study was the first to use a questionnaire which did not focus specifically on the veterans' symptoms themselves. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with those of other studies of post-Gulf war illness and thus strengthen overall findings in this area of research. Further examination of the mechanisms underlying the reporting of ill health is required.

Following the 1990β€“91 Gulf War there have been a number of published reports highlighting the increased morbidity of military personnel who served in the conflict. Studies from all over the world show that forces deployed to the Gulf (GWV) report more ill health than veterans who did not serve there (NGWV) [1-7]. In terms of the types of reported symptoms, different studies have discovered a range of nonspecific chronic conditions. Many research groups have noted that GWV are more likely to suffer from substantial fatigue, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and psychological distress [1,2,4]. Others have also described peripheral, respiratory, gastrointestinal, psychological and concentration problems [3].
Despite millions of dollars of funding and several independent investigations in a number of countries [8], the increased morbidity of GWV remains an unexplained phenomenon. Media interest and anecdotal reports have fuelled speculation concerning the existence of a Gulf War syndrome (GWS), linking reports of ill health to certain hazardous exposures experienced during the conflict. Most notably these include anti-chemical warfare nerve agent prophylaxis (NAPS), depleted uranium, multiple vaccinations, smoke from oil fires and pesticide use. It is hypothesised that exposure to these hazards has led to the development of a unique syndrome among some GWV, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder [4], fibromyalgia [9], chronic fatigue [1,10] and multiple chemical sensitivity [10,11]. However, attempts to specify and measure the syndrome have led to contradictory findings and interpretations [12]. Current opinion does not support the existence of a unique syndrome affecting GWV, but findings support an excess of non-specific self-reported ill health in this group [13,14].
This is the largest UK study of post-Gulf War morbidity to date, and the first to approach all veterans of the Gulf war (rather than a sample), including both serving and discharged personnel. The questionnaire focused on reproduction and child health, but a page was included which asked for information on the study participants' changes in health status since 1990. Since the focus of the study was on reproduction and child health, we reasoned that selection bias relating to the ill health of the veterans themselves might be reduced. Previous studies have included tick-boxes or grading scales with a list of possible symptoms for respondents to mark and GWV have tended to report increased frequencies of almost all symptoms included in questionnaires [1,3,4]. In contrast, we asked participants to respond to an open-ended question about 'any new medical problems or changes in general health since 1990'. By allowing veterans to report on a full and non-specific range of symptoms using free text it was hoped that they would report only those symptoms which they felt were most important to them.
The main objective of this analysis was to quantify and describe symptoms and diseases reported by UK GWV and a comparison group since 1990. We aimed to determine whether GWV still report more ill health, and/or a different profile of symptoms and diseases than NGWV when, i) their children's rather than their own health was the focus of the study; and ii) details of their own ill health were requested in a non-specific way using free-text. In addition, we aimed to estimate the number of GWV who believed that they had Gulf war syndrome (GWS), and to compare their reported disease/symptom profiles with GWV who did not believe they had the syndrome.

Methods
ull details of the study are reported elsewhere [15]. n brief, the ulf ar cohort () consisted of all  armed forces personnel deployed to the ulf area at any time between ugust 1990 and une 1991 (51,581 men and 1,230 women). pecial forces were excluded for security reasons. he comparison cohort () comprised demographically similar personnel who were in service on 1st anuary 1991 and were appropriately fit, but were not deployed to the ulf (51,688 men and 1,236 women). he group was stratum-matched on sex, age (five-year groups), service (rmy, avy, ir orce), rank (officer, other ranks), serving status at the time of the ulf ar (regular, reservist) and on fitness to be deployed (rmy and ir orce only). 42,818 men and 1,269 women responded to the survey, representing response rates of 48% and 66% respectively after adjusting for undelivered mail. or reasons of statistical power, the analyses reported in this paper were restricted to the 42,818 male responders.
asic demographic details and last known address for all surviving cohort members were obtained from the inistry of efence (o. D). Information was collected using a validated postal questionnaire sent to both serving and discharged military personnel between August 1998 and March 2001. In addition to questions on reproduction and pregnancy outcome, information was collected on the study participant's current health, and on changes in health status since 1990. Questions on service history, smoking status, current alcohol consumption, and details of vaccinations and exposure to specific chemical and environmental factors during the Gulf war (1990β€“91 for NGWV) were included. GWV were also asked if they considered that they had 'Gulf War syndrome' (Yes /No/Not Sure). Missing information was checked by letter or telephone, and an Intensive Tracing Study (ITS) of non-responders was conducted.
The primary outcome measure was the reporting of one or more new medical problems or changes in general health since 1990. Reported symptoms/diseases were coded into one of 36 different categories (based loosely on ICD-10 classification), and the data were examined by these ill health categories. Subjects were counted only once in the analysis if they had more than one symptom in the same category.
Statistical analysisAll analyses were performed using Stata 7.0 statistical software [16]. All p-values quoted are two-sided and values less than 0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. t-tests were conducted on log transformed data to compare the average number of ill health categories reported per subject in different groups. The association between deployment and ill health was explored using logistic regression analysis, calculating odds ratios and 95%CIs (with NGWV as baseline) for each ill health category. We adjusted for age at survey, service, rank, serving status at time of survey, smoking status and current alcohol consumption in all models.

Results
esponse. Data supplied by all male respondents are analysed here (24,379 GWV; 18,439 NGWV). Characteristics of these men and of those reporting one or more medical problems arising since 1990 are presented in Table 1. GWV responders were slightly younger than NGWV responders, and were more likely to have served in the Army, to not be an officer, to have left the Armed Services, to have ever smoked, and to have consumed larger amounts of alcohol. However, the differences in the distributions were not large. Among those reporting one or more medical symptom/disease, GWV were again younger, more likely to serve in the Army, to not be an Officer, and to have ever smoked.Table 1Characteristics of all male responders, and of those reporting one or more new medical symptom since 1990VariableALL MALE RESPONDERS1MALE RESPONDERS REPORTING β‰¥ 1 NEWMEDICAL SYMPTOM/DISEASE SINCE 19901GWVNGWVGWVNGWVn (%)n (%)n (%)n (%)Total24,379 (100)18,439 (100)14,411 (100)6,670 (100)Age at time of survey (years)β€ƒβ€ƒ20β€“295,506 (23)3,442 (19)3,361 (23)1,295 (19)β€ƒβ€ƒ30β€“347,871 (32)5,754 (31)4,523 (31)1,951 (29)β€ƒβ€ƒ35β€“395,492 (23)4,399 (24)3,222 (22)1,462 (22)β€ƒβ€ƒ40β€“443,019 (12)2,500 (14)1,797 (13)943 (14)β€ƒβ€ƒβ‰¥452,491 (10)2,343 (13)1,508 (11)1,019 (15)Mean (SD)35(6.8)36(7.3)35(6.8)36(7.9)Service at time of Gulf War2β€ƒβ€ƒArmy17,106 (70)12,559 (68)10,619 (74)4,750 (71)β€ƒβ€ƒRN2,417 (10)2,110 (11)1,227 (9)658 (10)β€ƒβ€ƒRAF4,856 (20)3,770 (21)2,565 (18)1,262 (19)Rank at time of Gulf War2β€ƒβ€ƒOfficer3,202 (13)3,062 (17)1,616 (11)1,068 (16)β€ƒβ€ƒOther ranks21,177 (87)15,377 (83)12,795 (89)5,602 (84)Serving status at time of surveyβ€ƒβ€ƒStill serving13,259 (54)10,553 (57)7,293 (51)3,366 (51)β€ƒβ€ƒNo longer serving11,120 (46)7,886 (43)7,118 (49)3,304 (50)Smokingβ€ƒβ€ƒEver13,514 (57)9,716 (54)8,468 (59)3,784 (57)β€ƒβ€ƒNever10,390 (44)8,379 (46)5,865 (41)2,870 (43)Alcohol intake at time of survey (units per week)β€ƒβ€ƒNone1,514 (7)1,190 (7)1,056 (8)531 (8)β€ƒβ€ƒ1β€“33,269 (14)2,377 (13)2,093 (15)1,002 (15)β€ƒβ€ƒ4β€“108,838 (38)6,848 (39)5,169 (37)2,398 (37)β€ƒβ€ƒ11β€“206,173 (26)4,767 (27)3,548 (25)1,638 (25)β€ƒβ€ƒβ‰¥213,632 (16)2,538 (14)2,180 (16)958 (15)"Gulf war syndrome"β€ƒβ€ƒYes1,324 (6)1,282 (9)β€ƒβ€ƒNo12,577 (53)-4,925 (35)-β€ƒβ€ƒNot sure9,692 (41)-8,041 (56)-1Numbers for each variable might not add up to total due to missing values. 2At 1st January 1991, or at time of first deployment if known (GWV responders).Symptoms/diseases61% of GWV reported at least one new medical symptom since 1990 compared with 37% of NGWV (adjusted OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5β€“2.8). The data are presented by ill health category in Table 2 in order of frequency of reporting by GWV (highest to lowest). The most common symptoms/diseases reported by GWV were skeletal and other muscular symptoms (15.1%), 'other' symptoms (13.1%), general fatigue (10.8%), memory loss/lack of concentration (7.9%) and skin allergies (7.6%). Accidental injury (2.6%) was among one of the most common ill health categories reported by NGWV. Overall, GWV reported significantly more symptoms/diseases than NGWV. Among all those reporting one or more new symptom/disease since 1990, GWV reported a median of two different ill health categories per subject (range 1β€“23), while NGWV reported a median of one (range 1β€“17) (p < 0.001).Table 2Summary of self-reported symptoms/diseases by deployment (ordered by frequency of reported ill health categories among GWV)Self-reported symptomFrequency (%)GWV vs. NGWVGWV1(n = 23,358)2NGWV1(n = 17,730)2Adjusted odds ratio 3 (95% CI)All reporting β‰¥ 1 new symptom/disease since 199014,1742 (60.7)6,5052 (36.7)2.7 (2.5β€“2.8)***Mental and behavioural disorders4,691 (20.1)634 (3.6)6.7 (6.1β€“7.3)***β€ƒMemory loss / lack of concentration1,883 (7.9)76 (0.4)19.6 (15.5β€“24.8)***β€ƒMood swings / aggression / irritability1,712 (7.3)62 (0.4)20.9 (16.2β€“27.0)***β€ƒAnxiety / stress / sleep disturbance1,212 (5.2)272 (1.5)3.4 (3.0β€“3.9)***β€ƒDepression1,005 (4.3)203 (1.1)3.6 (3.1β€“4.2)***β€ƒPTSD and associated symptoms (mentioned specifically)231 (1.0)68 (0.4)2.4 (1.8β€“3.1)***β€ƒSexual dysfunction / lack of sex drive192 (0.8)35 (0.2)4.6 (3.2β€“6.6)***β€ƒOther psychiatric / psychological disorders NOS4380 (1.6)65 (0.4)3.9 (3.0β€“5.1)***Musculo-skeletal & connective tissue disorders3,807 (16.3)2,387 (13.5)1.2 (1.2β€“1.3)***β€ƒSkeletal & other muscular symptoms3,523 (15.1)2,346 (13.2)1.1 (1.1β€“1.2)***β€ƒMuscular pain / weakness (mentioned specifically)460 (2.0)77 (0.4)4.5 (3.5β€“5.7)***Other symptoms NOS43,058 (13.1)1,146 (6.5)2.2 (2.0β€“2.3)***Fatigue2,632 (11.3)236 (1.3)9.1 (8.0β€“10.5)***β€ƒGeneral fatigue2,532 (10.8)215 (1.2)9.6 (8.3β€“11.1)***β€ƒChronic fatigue syndrome / ME (mentioned specifically)100 (0.4)21 (0.1)3.5 (2.1β€“5.5)***Nervous system disorders2,104 (9.0)435 (2.5)3.8 (3.4β€“4.2)***β€ƒHeadaches1,554 (6.7)280 (1.6)4.2 (3.7β€“4.8)***β€ƒNumbness / tingling / dizziness460 (2.0)93 (0.5)3.6 (2.9β€“4.6)***β€ƒEpilepsy53 (0.2)21 (0.1)1.6 (1.0β€“2.7)β€ƒOther neurological and neuromuscular problems NOS4217 (0.9)68 (0.4)2.4 (1.8β€“3.1)***Infection1,898 (8.1)606 (3.4)2.5 (2.3β€“2.7)***β€ƒChronic / frequent infection1,351 (5.8)278 (1.6)3.8 (3.3β€“4.3)***β€ƒSingle episodes of acute infection635 (2.7)351 (2.0)1.4 (1.2β€“1.6)***Skin allergies1,782 (7.6)414 (2.3)3.3 (3.0β€“3.7)***Respiratory disorders1,468 (6.3)569 (3.2)2.0 (1.8β€“2.2)***β€ƒAsthma608 (2.6)374 (2.1)1.2 (1.1β€“1.4)**β€ƒRespiratory problems NOS4898 (3.8)204 (1.2)3.3 (2.9β€“3.9)***Digestive, stomach & intestinal disorders1,377 (5.9)538 (3.0)2.0 (1.8β€“2.2)***Deterioration in general health852 (3.7)510 (2.9)1.3 (1.1β€“1.4)***β€ƒGeneral deterioration of eyesight / hearing582 (2.5)465 (2.6)1.0 (0.8β€“1.1)β€ƒGeneral decline in fitness / health280 (1.2)48 (0.3)4.4 (3.2β€“6.0)***Cardiovascular disorders675 (2.9)442 (2.5)1.3 (1.1β€“1.4)***Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disorders624 (2.7)210 (1.2)2.2 (1.9β€“2.6)***β€ƒHormonal imbalance / problems70 (0.3)38 (0.2)1.5 (1.0β€“2.2)β€ƒDiabetes57 (0.2)64 (0.4)0.7 (0.5β€“1.0)β€ƒWeight gain / loss504 (2.2)109 (0.6)3.4 (2.7β€“4.1)***Genito-urinary system disorders464 (2.0)198 (1.1)1.8 (1.5β€“2.1)***β€ƒGenital system & bladder problems5276 (1.2)99 (0.6)2.2 (1.7β€“2.7)***β€ƒKidney disease / symptoms209 (0.9)103 (0.6)1.5 (1.2β€“1.9)**Chest pains / tightness (not elsewhere classified)399 (1.7)134 (0.8)2.2 (1.8β€“2.6)***Allergies other than skin369 (1.6)161 (0.9)1.8 (1.5β€“2.1)***Night sweats / excessive sweating / "fevers"315 (1.4)23 (0.1)9.9 (6.5β€“15.2)***Accidental injury294 (1.3)460 (2.6)0.5 (0.4β€“0.5)***Auto-immune disease241 (1.0)196 (1.1)1.0 (0.8β€“1.2)Cancer6127 (0.5)88 (0.5)1.1 (0.9β€“1.5)1Subject can appear in the table as many times as they reported different symptoms.

For all but one ill health category (accidental injury), those who believed that they had GWS reported the highest symptom/disease prevalence, with unsure-GWS reporting intermediate frequencies for all categories (Table 3; Figure 2).Table 3Summary of self-reported symptoms/diseases among GWV by GWS status (ordered by frequency of reported ill health categories among GWS)Self-reported symptomFrequency (%)Adjusted2 odds ratio (95% CI)GWS1(n = 1,296)unsure-GWS1(n = 9,443)non-GWS1(n= 12,364)GWS vs non-GWSunsure GWS vs. non-GWSAll reporting β‰¥ 1 new symptom /disease since 19901,260 (97.2)7,929 (84.0)4,830 (39.1)48.2 (34.5β€“67.4)***8.0 (7.5β€“8.6)***Mental and behavioural disorders775 (59.8)3,076 (32.6)793 (6.4)18.3 (15.9β€“21.0)***6.6 (6.0β€“7.1)***β€ƒMemory loss / lack of concentration295 (22.8)1,249 (13.2)274 (2.2)12.1 (10.0β€“14.7)***6.6 (5.7β€“7.5)***β€ƒMood swings / aggression / irritability327 (25.2)1,147 (12.2)214 (1.7)16.1 (13.2β€“19.7)***6.9 (5.9β€“8.0)***β€ƒAnxiety / stress / sleep disturbance220 (17.0)769 (8.1)213 (1.7)10.8 (8.7β€“13.5)***4.7 (4.1β€“5.6)***β€ƒDepression245 (18.9)613 (6.5)137 (1.1)16.1 (12.7β€“20.4)***5.5 (4.5β€“6.6)***β€ƒPTSD and associated symptoms (mentioned specifically)91 (7.0)116 (1.2)21 (0.2)34.9 (20.8β€“58.7)***6.4 (4.0β€“10.5)***β€ƒSexual dysfunction / lack of sex drive42 (3.2)123 (1.3)27 (0.2)13.1 (7.7β€“22.3)***6.4 (4.2β€“9.9)***β€ƒOther psychiatric / psychological disorders NOS393 (7.2)237 (2.5)47 (0.4)14.7 (10.0β€“21.7)***5.7 (4.1β€“7.9)***Musculo-skeletal & connective tissue disorders500 (38.6)2,118 (22.4)1,156 (9.4)5.3 (4.6β€“6.1)***2.6 (2.4β€“2.9)***β€ƒSkeletal & other muscular symptoms441 (34.0)1,944 (20.6)1,107 (9.0)4.5 (3.9β€“5.2)***2.5 (2.3β€“2.7)***β€ƒMuscular pain / weakness (mentioned specifically)122 (9.4)265 (2.8)68 (0.6)16.2 (11.7β€“22.5)***5.1 (3.9β€“6.7)***Fatigue462 (35.7)1,742 (18.5)397 (3.2)15.4 (13.1β€“18.2)***6.9 (6.1β€“7.7)***β€ƒGeneral fatigue405 (31.3)1,707 (18.1)389 (3.2)13.1 (11.1β€“15.5)***6.8 (6.1β€“7.7)***β€ƒChronic fatigue syndrome / ME (mentioned specifically)57 (4.4)35 (0.4)8 (0.1)65.3 (29.4β€“145.1)***6.1 (2.8β€“13.5)***Other symptoms NOS3407 (31.4)1,720 (18.2)908 (7.3)5.4 (4.7β€“6.3)***2.8 (2.6β€“3.1)***Nervous system disorders373 (28.8)1,284 (13.6)415 (3.4)10.0 (8.4β€“11.8)***4.1 (3.6β€“4.6)***β€ƒHeadaches266 (20.5)958 (10.2)308 (2.5)8.7 (7.2β€“10.6)***3.9 (3.4β€“4.5)***β€ƒNumbness / tingling / dizziness101 (7.8)270 (2.9)82 (0.7)9.4 (6.8β€“12.9)***4.0 (3.1β€“5.2)***β€ƒEpilepsy12 (0.9)30 (0.3)9 (0.1)13.0 (5.0β€“34.1)***3.5 (1.6β€“7.5)**β€ƒOther neurological and neuromuscular problems NOS361 (4.7)114 (1.2)36 (0.3)14.3 (9.1β€“22.5)***4.2 (2.8β€“6.2)***Skin allergies242 (18.7)994 (10.5)531 (4.3)4.9 (4.1β€“5.9)***2.5 (2.3β€“2.8)***Digestive, stomach & intestinal disorders194 (15.0)813 (8.6)355 (2.9)5.5 (4.5β€“6.7)***3.2 (2.8β€“3.7)***Respiratory disorders194 (15.0)860 (9.1)400 (3.2)5.1 (4.2β€“6.2)***3.0 (2.6β€“3.4)***β€ƒAsthma71 (5.5)342 (3.6)188 (1.5)3.8 (2.8β€“5.1)***2.5 (2.1β€“3.0)***β€ƒRespiratory problems NOS3128 (9.9)540 (5.7)222 (1.8)5.6 (4.4β€“7.2)***3.2 (2.7β€“3.8)***Infection164 (12.7)1,102 (11.7)609 (4.9)2.9 (2.4β€“3.5)***2.6 (2.4β€“2.9)***β€ƒChronic / frequent infection122 (9.4)842 (8.9)372 (3.0)3.5 (2.8β€“4.4)***3.3 (2.9β€“3.7)***β€ƒSingle episodes of acute infection55 (4.2)319 (3.4)253 (2.1)2.2 (1.6β€“3.0)***1.8 (1.5β€“2.1)***Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disorders116 (9.0)366 (3.9)134 (1.1)7.4 (5.6β€“9.8)***3.4 (2.8β€“4.2)***β€ƒHormonal imbalance / problems14 (1.1)36 (0.4)20 (0.2)7.0 (3.3β€“14.8)***2.4 (1.4β€“4.2)***β€ƒDiabetes8 (0.6)29 (0.3)20 (0.2)3.3 (1.4β€“7.9)***2.0 (1.1β€“3.6)*β€ƒWeight gain / loss95 (7.3)306 (3.2)95 (0.8)8.0 (5.8β€“10.9)***3.9 (3.1β€“4.9)***Deterioration in general health92 (7.1)494 (5.2)256 (2.1)3.2 (2.5β€“4.2)***2.5 (2.1β€“2.9)***β€ƒGeneral deterioration of eyesight / hearing53 (4.1)310 (3.3)212 (1.7)2.2 (1.6β€“3.0)***1.9 (1.5β€“2.2)***β€ƒGeneral decline in fitness / health41 (3.2)191 (2.0)45 (0.4)8.3 (5.1β€“13.5)***5.7 (4.1β€“8.0)***Cardiovascular disorders90 (6.9)344 (3.6)237 (1.9)3.8 (2.9β€“5.0)***2.1 (1.8β€“2.5)***Genito-urinary system disorders77 (5.9)238 (2.5)143 (1.2)5.3 (3.9β€“7.2)***2.3 (1.8β€“2.8)***β€ƒGenital system & bladder problems446 (3.6)150 (1.6)79 (0.6)6.1 (4.0β€“9.2)***2.7 (2.0β€“3.6)***β€ƒKidney disease / symptoms35 (2.7)101 (1.1)68 (0.6)4.4 (2.8β€“6.9)***1.9 (1.4β€“2.6)***Night sweats / excessive sweating / "fevers"77 (5.9)185 (2.0)49 (0.4)13.7 (9.2β€“20.2)***4.7 (3.4β€“6.5)***Chest pains / tightness (not elsewhere classified)56 (4.3)253 (2.7)87 (0.7)5.5 (3.8β€“7.9)***3.3 (2.6β€“4.3)***Auto-immune disease37 (2.9)136 (1.4)64 (0.5)5.2 (3.3β€“8.1)***2.8 (2.1β€“3.8)***Allergies other than skin31 (2.4)197 (2.1)136 (1.1)2.7 (1.8β€“4.1)***2.2 (1.7β€“2.8)***Cancer519 (1.5)61 (0.7)42 (0.3)5.1 (2.8β€“9.2)***2.3 (1.5β€“3.4)***Accidental injury14 (1.1)128 (1.4)146 (1.2)0.9 (0.5β€“1.5)1.1 (0.8β€“1.4)1Subject can appear in the table as many times as they reported different symptoms.

Discussion
his is the largest study of male  veterans of the first ulf war and the only one to approach all those deployed. nlike other ulf war studies, information on ill health arising since the war was collected using free text. ur study confirmed that  were significantly more likely to report at least one new medical problem since 1990 than a non-deployed comparison group. t also confirmed that veterans were more likely to report higher numbers of symptoms/diseases. hese typically included skeletal and other muscular symptoms, general fatigue, memory loss/lack of concentration, skin allergies, mood swings/aggression and headaches. his pattern of symptom reporting is similar to that found in other studies of   [1-3], which looked at the same populations using different methods. or example, nwin et al [1] found that  reported all symptoms (in pre-defined categories) at higher frequencies than  in their study of a sample of  veterans with two matched comparison groups, while we found that  reported higher prevalence in 85% of ill health categories.
n terms of the nature of self-reported ill health, we found similar results to the range of symptoms that have been reported elsewhere. ray et al's [17] study of  found that over 50 percent of diagnoses could be classified into four large categories: diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (19.0%), mental disorders (14.7%), diseases of the respiratory system (10.5%) and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (9.4%). n our study the same four categories accounted for 50.3 percent of all reported symptoms/diseases and this figure rises to over 70 percent when the categories of fatigue and nervous system disorders are included. n additional point concerns the higher levels of accidental injury reported by  veterans; accidents were only half as likely to occur among  compared to  (1.3% versus 2.6%). his was surprising as mortality from accidents has repeatedly been found to be raised among  [18]. his difference is probably due to the inclusion of both major and minor injuries (including those resulting in bone fractures) in our study, and because  may be more inclined to report things they think are associated with their ulf ar service.
ur findings on ulf ar syndrome () approximate those from other studies [12-14,19,20].  significant proportion of  believed that they had  (5.6%) and this belief was associated with increased symptom reporting. his figure was lower than that reported by other studies (halder et al [12] found that 17.3% of  believed that they had ), but we are the first group to report on a large proportion of  who were 'unsure' of their -status (40.9%). 'nsure' veterans generally reported intermediate frequencies of ill health between those veterans who believed that they had  and those that did not. n a sample of  veterans, halder et al [12] found that those who believed they had  were more fatigued, more distressed, and more likely to have a post-traumatic stress reaction than veterans who did not believe they suffered from . ur data showed that  veterans reported higher frequencies of all categories of ill health (except accidental injury), including skeletal and other muscular symptoms, general fatigue, mood swings, memory loss/lack of concentration and headaches. n common with results from other studies of  [13,14,19,21], those who stated that they had ulf ar syndrome reported the same types of symptoms as all , but reported them at higher frequencies, providing evidence against a unique syndrome.
tudy limitations. In the absence of an official register or a mandatory health evaluation programme, obtaining accurate information from post-combat veterans is a difficult process and one which inevitably relies on self-reporting. This method of data collection introduces possible selection bias into a study. After adjusting for undelivered mail, response rates among men were 53% for GWV and 42% for NGWV [15]. Given the relatively low response rate, an intensive tracing study of non-responders was conducted to investigate possible selection bias. Data from the study indicated that the majority of reasons given for previous non-participation were entirely unrelated to reproduction or Gulf War service. Ninety percent of the reasons given by both GWV and NGWV for earlier non-response related to such things as not remembering receiving a questionnaire, thinking they had sent it back, or general 'mistrust' of the MoD [15]. It might therefore be concluded that response bias relating to adverse health outcomes was not large in this study.In terms of suitable controls, an advantage of this study was the comparison of GWV with another military cohort. Comparisons with civilian populations may have been misleading as military recruitment involves medical and fitness screening. Furthermore, 'healthy warrior' bias (where veterans deployed to the Gulf might be healthier than those who were not deployed) [22-24] is unlikely to account for the findings in our study because the comparison group were broadly matched to the GWV on fitness to be deployed.A potential problem with any retrospective study design is recall bias. The questionnaire asked veterans to consider any new medical problems or changes in general health they had experienced since the end of the Gulf War, and this involved them recalling events that might have happened up to seven or eight years in the past. During this time there has been much media speculation over Gulf War illness and this may have introduced recall bias and led to under- or over-reporting of certain symptoms. Gray et al have shown that participation in Gulf War health registries is greatly influenced by media attention and is likely to be influenced by compensation issues. This was illustrated by increased enrollment during periods of high media interest in Gulf War issues [17]. A further limitation of this study concerns the lack of clinical validation of self-reported ill health. However, conducting clinical examinations and psychiatric assessments of every veteran would have been time consuming and prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, studies looking at 'hard' clinical diagnoses or more objective outcomes, such as cancer [25] or hospitalisation rates [26], have shown no important differences between GWV and comparison groups. Researchers have concentrated instead on differences in 'softer' endpoints [1-3], which are similar to those reported here.

This study is consistent with other research showing a significant excess of morbidity among GWV. It also confirms the lack of specificity in post-Gulf war illness. These findings were replicated despite the fact that reproduction and child health were the focus of the study (rather than the veterans' general health), and questions relating to the veterans' own health were open-ended. Research groups have linked post-Gulf War ill health to a number of self-reported exposures but these analyses are limited by a lack of independent individual-level exposure data [1,27,28]. It has been suggested that changes in perception resulting from the disruption of war rather than specific exposures might be responsible [3], and there have been calls to move away from this narrow focus [29]. In the Gulf, disruption included change of climate, living conditions, diet, sleeping patterns, physical activity and separation from family, as well as the threat of chemical and biological weapons [27]. Despite such conjecture, explaining the increased ill health of GWV remains a controversial subject and there is no real consensus of opinion. In order for more rigorous aetiological studies of post-conflict illness to be undertaken in the future, there is a need to improve routine health surveillance and record-keeping both pre- and post- deployment [30]. This surveillance should also translate into more effective prevention and treatment programs in order to reduce the burden of post-war illness. Further research on the mechanisms underlying the reporting of ill health is required and this will entail a more qualitative approach to the problem of Gulf War illness. Continued quantitative documentation of the long-term health outcomes of Gulf War veterans remains essential.
