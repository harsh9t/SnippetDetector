Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram (CTM), have been widely prescribed for major depressive disorder, not only for adult populations, but also for children and pregnant mothers. Recent evidence suggests that chronic SSRI exposure in adults increases serotonin (5-HT) levels in the raphe system and decreases norepinephrine (NE) locus ceruleus (LC) neural activity, suggesting a robust opposing interaction between these two monoamines. In contrast, perinatal SSRI exposure induces a long-lasting downregulation of the 5-HT-raphe system, which is opposite to that seen with chronic adult treatment. Therefore, the goal of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that perinatal CTM exposure (20 mg/kg/d) from postnatal day 1 (PN1) to PN10 leads to hyperexcited NE-LC circuit function in adult rats (>PN90). Our single-neuron LC electrophysiological data demonstrated an increase in spontaneous and stimulus-driven neural activity, including an increase in phasic bursts in CTM-exposed animals. In addition, we demonstrated a corresponding immunoreactive increase in the rate-limiting catalyzing catecholamine enzyme (tyrosine hydroxylase) within the LC and their neocortical target sites compared to saline controls. Moreover, these effects were only evident in male exposed rats, suggesting a sexual dimorphism in neural development after SSRI exposure. Together, these results indicate that administration of SSRIs during a sensitive period of brain development results in long-lasting alterations in NE-LC circuit function in adults and may be useful in understanding the etiology of pervasive developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.
