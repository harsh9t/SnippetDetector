Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Werner syndrome, also known as childhood- and adulthood-progeria, respectively, represent two of the best characterized human progeroid diseases with clinical features mimicking physiological aging at an early age. The discovery of their genetic basis has led to the identification of several gene mutations leading to a spectrum of progeroid phenotypes ranging from moderate and mild-severe to very aggressive forms. In parallel, the creation of disease registers and databases provided available data for the design of relatively large-scale epidemiological studies, thereby allowing a better understanding of the nature and frequency of the premature aging-associated signs and symptoms. The aim of this article is to review the most recent findings concerning the epidemiology of premature aging disorders, their genetic basis, and the most recent reports on the frequency of associated diseases.

Hutchinsonβ€“Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Werner syndrome (WS) are two of the best
characterized human progeroid diseases with clinical features mimicking physiological aging at an
early age, the first being referred as to childhood progeria, and the latter as progeria of
adulthood.1 An increasing number of intermediate
progeroid phenotypes, known as atypical progeroid syndromes, atypical HGPS, or atypical WS, have
been described.1 The aim of this review article is
to describe the most recent findings concerning the epidemiology of premature aging disorders, their
genetic basis, and the most recent reports on the frequency of associated diseases.

Hutchinsonβ€“ilford rogeria yndrome
 is an extremely rare genetic disorder affecting about one per four to eight million live
births.2 ore precisely, the reported prevalence
rate of the disease is one in eight million births, but if unreported or misdiagnosed cases are
taken into account, the estimated birth prevalence is one in four million.2
ccording to the rogeria esearch oundation database (http://www.progeriaresearch.org/prf-by-the-numbersprf.html), there are an estimated
200β€“250 children living with progeria worldwide at any one time, and 103 of them have been
identified as of pril 2013. rogeria affects both sexes and all races, and  cases have been
discovered in over 40 different countries. n particular, a map of ascertained  children is
available at the rogeria esearch oundation portal (http://www.fidtheother150.org/), and there are records of 20 cases in orthern merica,
16 cases in entral and outhern merica, 24 cases in urope and the editerranean regions, four
cases in frica, and 18 cases in sia.
he disease was named after the reports by onathan utchinson and astings ilford, the doctors
who first described it in ngland, and it is classified as a segmental progeroid syndrome since
multiple organs and tissues replicate phenotypes associated with normal aging.3,4
hildren with  appear healthy at birth but develop distinctive clinical features during the
first years of their life, including severe growth retardation, usually associated with skeletal
alteration as well as loss of subcutaneous fat and skin appendages, and some developmental processes
are delayed (dentition) or absent.4 eath occurs in
those affected by their early teenage years, and usually results from heart attacks and
strokes.1
he majority of classical  is caused by a de novo point mutation in exon 11 of the
 gene (c.1824>, p.608).5 he  gene encodes -type lamins, which are intermediate filament
proteins of the inner nuclear lamina. he c.1824> mutation results in the activation of a
cryptic splice donor site that removes 150 nucleotides from exon 11. he resulting lamin
β�†150 messenger ribonucleic acid gives rise to a lamin  isoform containing an internal
deletion of 50 amino acids, known as progerin (a protein that cannot undergo complete
maturation).5 amins constitute the major component
of the nuclear lamina; in addition to providing structure and shape to the nucleus, they are
involved in organizing several processes including chromatin organization, deoxyribonucleic acid
() replication, transcription,  methylation and epigenetic regulation, and  repair.6 hose mechanisms are impaired in  and might
contribute to the progeria phenotype. ndeed, cells obtained from  patients show a markedly
reduced lifespan when grown in culture, and accumulate defects in nuclear structure and architecture
with cell passaging, including lobulation of the nuclear envelope, thickening of the nuclear lamina,
loss of peripheral heterochromatin, and clustering of nuclear pores, which are accompanied by an
increase in the amount of progerin within the cells.7
-associated symptoms. A visible vein across the nasal bridge is often the first observable sign in HGPS infants. A
profound failure to thrive occurs during the first year, usually from 6 months to 12 months. On
average, HGPS children gain 0.4β€“0.5 kg/year and reach a final weight of about 14β€“15
kg and a final height of 110 cm. Progressive alopecia usually takes place within 6 months to 2
years, and between the ages of 2 years and 3 years, most children become bald.8 Other symptoms become apparent during the first year to third year,
including characteristic facies, loss of subcutaneous fat, stiffness of joints, bone changes, and
abnormal tightness of the skin over the abdomen and upper thighs.1 With time, the skin becomes thin, dry, and atrophic, with reduced
turgor and sometimes with hyperkeratosis. Small, light-brown spots frequently develop on the neck
and upper thorax, and subsequently on the scalp and limbs. Typical facial abnormalities include a
receding mandible, a small and beaked nose, prominent scalp veins, prominent eyes, and protruding
ears that lack lobules. The facial characteristics gradually develop and both the face and body
change with time: the subcutaneous fat in the face disappears completely and the facial muscles
decrease in size. The body shows increasing loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle bulk and the joints
protrude.1,8,9 At the bone level,
patients show clavicular hypoplasia, generalized osteopenia, and acroosteolyses of distal phalanges.
Motor and mental development is normal, cognitive functions are preserved, and the children follow a
normal psychosocial development and show normal behaviors for their age.1,9 Dentition is delayed
and crowded.9 HGPS individuals have a high-pitched
voice, do not reproduce, and their appearance becomes like that of an older person with time.1,8Additional findings that are present in some but not all affected individuals include excessive
ocular tearing, photophobia, exposure keratitis, and Raynaudβ€™s phenomenon.9 Most children die in their early teens from heart
attacks and strokes caused by progressive atherosclerotic disease, with myocardial infarction
representing the most frequent cause of death at a mean age of around 13 years.8 A comprehensive description of most of the HGPS-associated
manifestations is provided in the following sections.Cardiovascular disease in HGPSCardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the principal factor affecting mortality in HGPS
individuals, with death resulting from myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive cardiac failure
in 75% of cases.10 Cardiovascular problems are
absent during the first 5 years of life, but children gradually develop shortness of breath with
exertion and easy fatigability from the age of 6β€“8 years.10 Accelerated CVD leads to debilitating morbidity in HGPS and
culminates in mortality from myocardial infarction or stroke at an average age of 13 years.11The rapid progression of CVD in HGPS presents an opportunity to explore the natural history of
human CVD, and a study performed on 26 HGPS patients and 22 matched controls revealed that the
carotidβ€“femoral pulse wave velocity was dramatically elevated in patients.11 Carotid duplex ultrasound echobrightness, assessed as
a measure of arterial wall density, was significantly greater than age- and sex-matched controls in
the intimaβ€“media, near adventitia, and deep adventitia, as was internal carotid artery mean
flow velocity.11 Overall, those data demonstrated
that, along with peripheral vascular occlusive disease, accelerated vascular stiffening is an early
and pervasive mechanism of vascular disease in HGPS.11Autopsy data have shown widespread atherosclerosis in HGPS patients. Particularly, advanced
coronary atherosclerotic lesions have been reported, and the arteries were frequently stenosed or
occluded by plaques or narrowing of intramural arteries. Occlusion of the right coronary artery,
lesions of the left anterior descending artery, and severe atherosclerosis of the aorta, represent
common findings in HGPS.10 Valvular changes and
pulmonary arterial lesions have also been reported in HGPS individuals.10Cerebrovascular disease in HGPSCerebrovascular arteriopathy and stroke have been recently assessed by means of a neurovascular
imaging cohort study of HGPS, a study aimed to identify the neurovascular features, infarct type,
topography, and natural history of stroke.12 A
total of 25 children with confirmed diagnoses of HGPS were included in the study, which revealed a
vasculopathy unique to HGPS, including distinctive intracranial stenoocclusive arterial lesions,
basal cistern collateral vessels, and slow compensatory collateral flow over the cerebral
convexities. Moreover, the authors identified early and clinically silent strokes as a prevalent
disease characteristic in HGPS. Indeed, a radiographic evidence of infarction was found in 60% of
patients, of which half were likely clinically silent.12Skeletal abnormalities in HGPSA recent study performed with an inducible and tissue-specific mouse model, which expresses the
most common HGPS mutation (c.1824C>T) in osteoblasts and odontoblasts, revealed that the
expression of the HGPS mutation during osteoblast development results in a loss of osteocytes,
irregular mineralization, and poor biomechanical properties.13A comprehensive survey of the skeletal dysmorphisms observed in children with HGPS using
conventional radiography was obtained from 39 children with the classic HGPS genotype, representing
approximately 15%β€“20% of the worldβ€™s HGPS population.14 Small clavicles were observed in 100% of the patients; followed by
coxa valga and acroosteolysis, which were observed in more than 90% of the patients; and resorption
of the distal clavicles and narrow apices, both present in 82% of the subjects. Other frequent
skeletal abnormalities were hip dysplasia (69%) and thin ribs (59%). In addition, 30% to 45% of the
patients showed resorption of the anterior ribs, closed sagittal suture, generalized osteopenia,
focal cortical defects, flexed fingers, ulnar minus variant, or enlarged heart. Less frequent
(20%β€“30%) were dystrophic calcification, sagittal suture diastasis, enlarged femoral head,
pseudoarthrosis, enlarged femoral greater trochanter, and avascular necrosis of the proximal femur.
Kyphoscoliosis, enlarged humoral head, narrowed humoral diaphysis, prominent pulmonary vessels, and
wormian bones were reported in less than 15% of the patients, and other abnormalities, such as
accentuated osteopenia of proximal humoral/femoral epiphysis, rib fracture, Madelung deformity,
ivory epiphyses, bifid rib, and congenitally fused ribs were reported in 10% or less of the
patients.14Craniofacial abnormalities in HGPSUsing the Progeria Research Foundation medical and research database (http://www.progeriaresearch.org/medical_database.html), data on 25 HGPS patients have
been examined in order to provide an overview of the craniofacial abnormalities in progeria.15Concerning scalp, calvarial, and skull base features, thinning of the calvarium was seen in 95%
of the individuals, often accompanied by a paucity of scalp fat (91%). A mottled appearance of the
skull was seen in 59% of the patients. Two individuals (8%) had skull fractures, and prominent
vascular markings of the bony calvaria were observed in 90% of the subjects. Craniofacial
disproportion (a large cranium relative to the facial size), and a J-shaped sella were observed in
almost 90% of the patients, and a delayed closure of the anterior fontanel was seen in 56% of
them.15Concerning oral maxillary, zygomatic arch, and parotid gland features, the authors observed a
short mandibular ramus in 83% of the patients, with a gracile thin zygomatic arch in 50% of them. A
shallow glenoid fossa with a hypoplastic or absent articular eminence and flattening of the
mandibular condyle were seen in 43% of the patients. Moreover, 45% of the children had a V-shaped
palate, and 50% of them had disorganized dentition. A prominent parotid gland was seen in all the
children analyzed.15With regard to orbital features, hypotelorism was noted in 86% of the children, and kinking of
the optic nerves was seen in 89%.15Other manifestations in HGPSFifteen patients with HGPS have been enrolled in a prospective study to evaluate otologic and
audiologic manifestations.16 All patients had
stiff auricular cartilages, small or absent lobules, and hypoplasia of the lateral soft-tissue
portion of the external ear canal leading to a shortened canal. A low-frequency conductive hearing
loss in the 250 Hz to 500 Hz range was observed in 86.4% of the ears, despite largely normal
tympanometry.16 In addition, 71% of the patients
had dry cerumen impaction, and 29% of them reported a history of recurrent otitis media.16Insulin resistance occurs in about 50% of affected patients without progression to diabetes
mellitus.9 A rare case of a 10-year-old boy with
genetically confirmed classical HGPS and hypoparathyroidism has been reported.17 Differently from other premature aging syndromes, such as WS or
others caused by mutations of DNA repair genes, there is no reported increase of cancer incidence in
HGPS patients.8,18 Cataracts are not frequent.8 We recently reviewed neurodegenerative signs or symptoms in premature aging disorders, and
they are absent in HGPS individuals.1From mild to severe progeria: the genetic basis of classical HGPS and atypical progeria
syndromesAlthough the majority (approximately 90%) of classical HGPS is caused by a de novo point mutation
in exon 11 of the LMNA gene (c.1824C>T, p.G608G), it was clear from the
beginning that other mutations in LMNA could cause a similar phenotype.5 Particularly, the genetic basis of HGPS was identified
in 2003 by two independent research groups.5,19 Eriksson et al5 observed the G608G mutation in 90% of 20 HGPS individuals, and De
Sandre- Giovannoli et al19 observed it in two
affected children. A patient with a c.1822G>A mutation (p.G608S), with classical HGPS, was
also recorded by Eriksson et al.5The LMNA gene encodes the four different A-type lamins (lamin A, lamin
Aβ�†10, lamin C, and lamin C2), which are intermediate filament proteins of the inner nuclear
lamina.1 Lamin A (encoded by exons 1β€“12)
and lamin C (encoded by exons 1β€“10) are the major proteins expressed in differentiated
cells. Lamin Aβ�†10 is identical to lamin A except that it lacks exon 10 and has been detected
in cells from colon and placenta, in leukocytes and fibroblasts, and in tumor cells. Lamin C2 has an
alternative exon 1 compared with lamin C and is present in germ cells.1 Lamin A proteins contain CaaX boxes at their C-terminal ends; they are
synthesized as prelamin A proteins, which undergo farnesylation and other posttranslational
modifications to become mature proteins (Figure
1).The p.G608G mutation results in the activation of a cryptic splice donor site, leading to the
production of a lamin A isoform containing an internal deletion of 50 amino acids, known as progerin
β€“ a protein that cannot undergo complete maturation.5 Particularly, the deletion eliminates the site for endoproteolitic
cleavage by zinc metalloproteinase Ste24 homolog (ZMPSTE24), a cleavage required for the production
of mature lamin A. The recurrent c.1824C>T mutation causing HGPS is a de novo dominant point
mutation, mostly originating on the paternal allele and often linked with advanced paternal
age.5The zinc metalloprotease, ZMPSTE24, plays a critical role in nuclear lamin biology by cleaving
the prenylated and carboxylmethylated 15-amino acid tail from the C-terminus of prelamin A to yield
mature lamin A (Figure 1). Two patients with
extraordinarily severe forms of progeria caused by unusual mutations in LMNA have
been described.20 Both mutations
(IVS11+1G>A and p.V607V) resulted in a strong activation of the aberrant splice site
observed in typical HGPS, leading to increased progerin expression compared to typical HGPS
cases.20 By contrast, two subjects bearing a
missense (p.T623S) mutation leading to the deletion of 35 amino acids in exon 11 of
LMNA showed a less aggressive progeroid phenotype (slowly progressing progeria)
compared to classical HGPS.21,22 Overall, the amount of toxic progerin in cells
appears to correlate with the severity of disease outcomes.20Interestingly, recessive mutations in ZMPSTE24 also disrupt lamin A proteolytic
processing and are associated with three distinct but related human diseases that share features of
premature aging, with a gradation of severity.23
Indeed, ZMPSTE24 mutations cause: (1) the mild progeroid disorder mandibuloacral
dysplasia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation,
craniofacial anomalies, skeletal malformations, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation; (2) a severe
form of progeria denoted as atypical HGPS; and (3) restrictive dermopathy (RD), a fatal neonatal
disorder characterized by severe intrauterine growth delay that can be considered as an
β€�extreme formβ€� of premature aging.23 Twenty human ZMPSTE24 alleles have been identified that are associated
with those diseases. They have been recently reviewed by Barrowman et al,24 who demonstrated a correlation between decreasing ZMPSTE24 protease
activity and increasing disease severity. Particularly, complete loss-of-function alleles are
associated with RD, whereas retention of partial, measurable activity results in mandibuloacral
dysplasia or severe progeria.23Figure 1 illustrates most of the known
LMNA and ZMPSTE24 mutations linked to progeroid diseases.Although the mechanism whereby persistently farnesylated lamin A, either resulting from
LMNA or ZMPSTE24 mutations, causes premature aging phenotypes is
unknown, changes in chromatin architecture and in histone methylation and gene expression, defective
DNA repair and accumulation of DNA damage, impaired structural and mechanical properties of the
nuclear lamina, and perturbations in transcription factors and nuclear proteins, are among the
suggested pathologic mechanisms.1,8The diagnosis of HGPS is based on the recognition of common clinical features and the detection
of either the c.1824C>T (p.G608G) heterozygous LMNA mutation in the classic
form of HGPS, or one of three of the heterozygous LMNA mutations in atypical HGPS:
c.1822G>A (p.G608S), c.1821G>A (p.V607V), or c.1968+1G>A
(IVS11+1G>A) (Figure 1).9 Noteworthy, several patients with atypical progeroid
syndromes, which have been referred to as atypical progeroid syndromes (also called atypical HGPS,
nonclassical progeria, or atypical WS), do not carry LMNA splicing mutations, but
other heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous mutations in the LMNA
gene.24 The clinical features of those patients
include growth retardation and involve the same body systems (bones, body fat, skin, and hair) as in
classical HGPS, but the course and severity of the symptoms vary. The patients have differing ages
of onset and symptom severity, with some nearly as severe as HGPS, others (such as p.R435C) leading
to atypically mild RD, but most are far less severe.24 For example, patients affected by atypical WS have early onset of aging phenotypes and an
accelerated rate of disease progression than typical WS individuals; they also commonly show absence
of bilateral cataracts and diabetes, which are common features in typical WS.25 Over 20 LMNA mutations causing atypical progeroid
syndromes have been discovered and have been recently reviewed by Doubaj et al;23 these are summarized in Figure 1.In this regard, a dominantly inherited premature aging syndrome that includes prominent
cardiovascular and cutaneous manifestations, called LMNA-associated cardiocutaneous
progeria syndrome, was recently described.26 The
disease showed a later onset than classical HGPS, with skin manifestations of aging appearing in the
third decade of life. Affected individuals also developed CVD leading to death in their fourth
decade. One affected individual in this family also showed primary malignancies not previously
reported in LMNA-linked progeria disorders. This atypical progeroid syndrome was
caused by a novel LMNA mutation (c.899A>G, p.D300G) leading to
abnormalities of the nuclear membrane architecture.26There is also indication from studies in nonagenarians suggesting that common
LMNA polymorphisms and haplotypes may play a role in the human lifespan.27 In this regard, RodrΓ­guez and Eriksson28 have recently observed that an LMNA
single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4641) results in low and high expressing alleles of the
LMNA gene, and might account for the variability in phenotype seen among HGPS
individuals.28 Noteworthy, not all
LMNA mutations cause progeria. More than 450 mutations of the gene have been
described causing several different autosomal dominant or recessive diseases collectively called
primary laminopathies, and these include muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies, neuropathies,
cardiomyopathies, and the above-discussed segmental progeroid syndromes.26,29

Werner syndrome
 is a rare autosomal recessive disorder also called adult progeria, and represents the most
studied disease model of premature aging in adulthood.30 n the apanese population, a founder effect has been described, and the frequency of 
has been roughly estimated to be 1:100,000.30
nother cluster of  has been identified in ardinia, with 18 described cases due to a founder
effect.31 he prevalence of heterozygous carriers
in apan is approximately 1/167, and it is estimated to be approximately 1/120 in ardinia.31 utside of apan the disease prevalence is estimated
to be approximately 1:1,000,000β€“1:10,000,000.30
he syndrome was first described in the doctoral thesis of erner32 in 1904. ccording to a recent report, 1,487  cases have been
recorded from 1904 to the end of 2008 β€“ 1,128 in apan and 359 outside apan.33 he patients develop features reminiscent of
premature aging beginning in the second decade of life, including grey hair, alopecia, prematurely
aged face with beaked nose, skin atrophy with scleroderma-like lesions, ischemic heart disease,
osteoporosis, bilateral cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, lipodystrophy, and hypogonadism. hey
also experience an increased risk of cancers, and in most cases, they die because of malignant
tumors or arteriosclerosis during the fourth and fifth decades of life.30
he disease is caused by mutations of the  gene, which encodes the 
protein, a member of the ec. Q DNA helicase family.34 WRN is a multifunctional nuclear protein that maintains genome stability by means of
DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), 3β€²β†’5β€² helicase,
3β€²β†’5β€² exonuclease, and DNA strand annealing activities.35 Most of the WRN mutations result in the production
of truncated proteins lacking the nuclear localization signal, with the subsequent absence of
functional WRN protein in nuclei.36 WRN has
several functional domains and is considered to be a β€�caretaker of the genomeβ€� since
it participates in distinct DNA metabolic pathways, including DNA replication, DNA recombination,
telomere maintenance, apoptosis, and DNA repair.36
Cells isolated from WS individuals display increased chromosomal aberrations and premature
senescence in culture, as well as accelerated telomere shortening and several defects in DNA
replication.37
In 20% of cases, WS is not caused by WRN gene mutations, but often by mutations
in the LMNA gene.25 As discussed
in the previous section of this paper, WS caused by LMNA mutations is referred to
as atypical Wernerβ€™s syndrome.25
WS-associated symptomsThe lack of a pubertal growth spurt during the teen years is the first clinical sign in WS
individuals, leading to a characteristic short stature and low bodyweight. A recent analysis of 196
WS Japanese cases reported that mean height and bodyweight were 158.3 cm and 45.3 kg for male
patients, and 148.5 cm and 37.7 kg for female patients, respectively.38 In their 20s and 30s, WS individuals begin to manifest alopecia,
greying hair, and scleroderma-like skin changes, followed by bilateral cataracts, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, hypogonadism, skin ulcers, and osteoporosis.1A recent epidemiological study of 196 cases revealed that greying or loss of hair, bird-like
faces, cataracts, and skin atrophy were present in 93% to 99%.38 Other common features were clavus or callus, skin ulcers, flat foot,
abnormality of the voice, and calcification in the Achilles tendon, observed in 80%β€“90% of
the subjects.38 Similarly, a trend analysis in
Japanese WS individuals revealed that bird-like faces and a stocky trunk with extremely thin
extremities are still a hallmark of the disease, but the body size, which is also still small, has
been expanding in recent years, in concert with the growing constitution of the general Japanese
population, and some patients exceeded 177 cm in height and weighed over 70 kg.33Abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, hypogonadism, and bone deformity appear by the fourth
decade of life in WS subjects.38 Impaired glucose
tolerance is reported in 15%β€“20% of WS subjects, diabetes mellitus in 55%β€“70%, and
dyslipidemia in 60%β€“85%.38 Fertility in WS
patients appears to decline soon after sexual maturity, and hypogonadism has been reported in 40% of
both sexes.38 Osteoporosis was observed in more
than 60% of WS cases, while osteoarthritis has not been frequently reported in WS.33,38For several years, the clinical diagnosis of WS was based on the presence of four cardinal signs
(cataracts, skin changes, short stature, and greying or loss of hair), which are observable in more
than 95% of the cases, as well as on additional signs (osteoporosis, voice change, atherosclerosis,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and so on). For a definite diagnosis, all the cardinal signs (onset over
10 years old) and two additional signs should have been present. In addition, sequencing of the
WRN gene could be performed, and the absence of normal WRN protein would be
confirmed by Western blot analysis.4,35Following more recent observations, revised diagnostic criteria have been proposed,38 including the following cardinal signs and symptoms
(onset over 10 years until 40 years of age): (1) progeroid changes of the hair (gray hair, baldness,
and so on); (2) cataracts (bilateral); (3) changes of the skin (atrophic skin, tight skin, clavus,
callus); (4) soft-tissue calcification (Achilles tendon, and so on); (5) bird-like face; and (6)
abnormal voice (high-pitched, squeaky, hoarse). Additional signs include abnormal glucose and/or
lipid metabolism, deformation and abnormality of the bone (osteoporosis, and so on), malignant
tumors, parental consanguinity, premature atherosclerosis, hypogonadism, short stature, and low
bodyweight. The diagnosis is confirmed if all the cardinal signs are present, or if there is a gene
mutation in addition to at least three cardinal signs, and suspected if two or more cardinal signs
are present, or if 1β€“2 cardinal signs in addition to other signs, are present.38An unusual spectrum of cancers has been observed in WS subjects who usually die at a mean age of
53β€“54 years from cancer or arteriosclerosis.30 Controversy exists regarding the degree of brain involvement in WS.1 A discussion of recent reports of cancer, atherosclerosis, and nervous
system disorders in WS will be provided in the following sections.Atherosclerosis and cancer in WSComplications caused by atherosclerosis and cancer represent the major cause of death in WS
subjects. Arteriosclerosis obliterans has been observed in more than 20% of WS subjects, and
coronary heart disease in 11%β€“16% of them.38 Less frequent are cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction, observed in 2%β€“5%
of cases.38 According to recent trend analyses,
atherosclerosis in WS subjects might result from either abnormal lipid metabolism, or from
inflammatory mechanisms.33Concerning the cancer incidence in WS individuals, 339 (23%) out of the 1,487 WS cases described
up to the end of 2008 were diagnosed with cancer,33 and a nationwide epidemiological study carried out in Japan from 2009 to 2011 revealed
that cancer occurred in more than 40% of the 196 analyzed WS cases.38 Cancer in WS individuals often manifests with early age of onset, a
high frequency of specific tumor types, including uncommon tumor types and unusual tumor sites, and
with the presence of multiple tumors in individual patients.39Lauper et al39 have recently provided a
detailed and quantitatively rigorous view of cancer type and associated type-specific risk in WS.
Frequent neoplasms included: thyroid neoplasms (16.1%), malignant melanoma (13.3%), meningioma
(10.9%), soft tissue sarcomas (10.1%), hematologic/lymphoid cancers (9.3%), and osteosarcomas
(7.7%). Other cancers, including nonmelanoma skin cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, ovarian cancer,
genitourinary tract cancers, hepatobiliary cancer, head and neck carcinomas, and breast cancer, were
observed in 3%β€“5% of the cases. Less frequent cancers (1%β€“2%) were those of the lung
and central nervous system, as well as adrenocortical carcinomas.39 A trend analysis in Japan revealed that the average age of onset of
malignancy in WS increased from 37 years old in 1966 to 49 years old in 2008.33Nervous system disorders in WSWe recently reviewed neurological abnormalities in premature aging disorders, and they are not
constant findings in WS.1 Brain atrophy has been
observed in 40% of WS patients, but only a few cases of dementia or peripheral neuropathy have been
reported. A few cases of dementia have been recorded, but the analysis of amyloid beta pep-tide and
hyperphosphorylated tau protein (the hallmarks of Alzheimerβ€™s dementia) revealed that WS
individuals do not usually appear to be susceptible to Alzheimerβ€™s disease.1 Myelopathy, demyelinization, and associated central
and/or peripheral neuropathy have been described in at least six patients.40β€“44
Schizophrenia of the paranoia type was also recorded in about 10% of patients.33Genetics of WSTypical WS is an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Therefore, the parents of a proband are
obligate heterozygotes for a disease-causing mutation, and at conception each sibling of an affected
individual has a 25% chance of being affected and a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier.
Classical WS is caused by mutations of the WRN gene on chromosome 8. The locus
spans approximately 250 kb and consists of 35 exons.34More than 70 WRN gene mutations have been found in WS patients; these are mainly
nonsense mutations, insertions, and/or deletions, as well as splice mutations resulting in the
production of truncated proteins lacking the nuclear localization signal, with subsequent absence of
functional WRN protein in nuclei.36,45 The WRN protein has several functional domains (Figure 2), and mutations leading to WS have been observed
in all of them. There are founder mutations reported among Japanese patients (c.3139-1G>C,
which results in skipping of exon 26) and in Sardinian patients (c.2089-3024A>G, which
creates a new exon between exons 18 and 19).30,31 Potential founder mutations have
been reported for Dutch (c.3590delA, p.N1197fs), Turkish (c.3460-2A>G, exon 30 deletion),

The most common mutation in Caucasians is a stop codon mutation in exon 9 (c.1105C>T,
p.R369X), accounting for approximately 20% of the mutations.45 Genetic screening combined with Western blot analysis are performed
as routine diagnostic tests, and Figure 2 shows the
most frequent mutations observed by ethnic group.

Advancements in our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of premature aging disorders
have led to a better understanding of the onset and progression of the clinical manifestations. They
include, for example, the recent discovery of high- and low-expressing LMNA alleles
that might account for the different phenotypes observed in HGPS patients, a better characterization
of the mutations leading to impaired or completely absent ZMPSTE24 protein activity, or those in the
LMNA gene leading to atypical HGPS, overall accounting for a spectrum of disorders
ranging from neonatal progeria to atypical WS.20β€“28
In parallel, the advancements in diagnostic examination techniques, and the creation of disease
registers or databases allowing large caseβ€“control epidemiological studies in both HGPS and
WS patients, have led to a better understanding of the epidemiology of disease-associated signs and
symptoms. This has led, for example, to a proposed revision of the clinical diagnostic criteria for
WS, to the discovery that cerebral infarctions in HGPS are more frequent than expected, and to a
better understanding of cancer incidence in WS, among others.12,38,39
Treatments for HGPS and WS are only available for the symptoms rather than for the disease
itself. For example, aggressive treatment of skin ulcers, cholesterol-lowering drugs if the lipid
profile is abnormal, control of type 2 diabetes mellitus, surgical treatment of cataracts, and
treatment of malignancies in a standard fashion are among the available medicaments in WS, which are
often accompanied by dietary/physical regimens to reduce atherosclerosis risk.1
Similarly, drugs, dietary changes, and exercise are recommended for HGPS individuals to
counteract atherosclerosis risk, body fat reduction, and atrophy of muscles.1 Interestingly, the results of the first clinical trial in HGPS revealed
that lonafarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, resulted in better hearing, improved bone
structure, and led to gaining additional weight and/or to increased flexibility of the blood
vessels.46 In this regard, recent trend analyses
in Japanese WS patients are extremely important,33
as they showed a delayed onset of typical progeroid phenotypes in WS, which may be explained by the
environmental changes including lifestyle and medical improvements, thereby offering a potential for
interventional trials.
It is clear from that survey that, in recent years, there has been a trend toward an increase in
body size in WS patients, as well as a delayed average age at onset of malignancies that follow the
rapid improvement and changes in the average lifespan and lifestyle in the general population all
over the world.33 The future will be to combine
genetic, diagnostic, and epidemiological data in order to clarify several of these
geneβ€“environment interactions and their relevance to the onset of disease-related symptoms.
In addition, as recently shown by some authors studying HGPS patients,28 a deeper characterization of the genetics of prematurely aged
individuals might help to explain and predict the onset and progression of some of the symptoms,
since several of these symptoms might result from the combined presence of different mutations in
the same or different genes, thereby opening a window for personalized interventions.
