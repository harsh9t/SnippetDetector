To establish the neonatal screening method of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, G6PD activity was measured using the fluorescence spot test (FST) using dried blood samples on filter paper. The G6PD/6PGD rate test of venous blood samples was further performed for confirmation. The positive G6PD deficiency rate was 4.2% and its detection rates were 3.7% for all neonates and 5.2% only for male newborns when FST was used for neonatal screening. Conformation rates by use of G6PD/ 6PGD ratio test for G6PD deficiency were 86.8% and 100% particularly in the severely deficient groups. Both sensitivity and specificity were very high in the severely deficient groups. FST can be used in neonatal screening of G6PD deficiency because of its high accuracy, applicability, and simplicity. Moreover, a high volume of dried blood samples on filter paper can be tested quickly. It is very favorable to diagnose and treat G6PD deficiency early in high incidence districts.
