The findings of these two studies were confirmed in the JEWEL study program, with JEWEL 1 conducted among 1138 patients from the UK and Canada and JEWEL 2 conducted in 1107 patients from Europe.
The Caduet Adherence Research Program and Education (CARPE) retrospective cohort studies were designed to evaluate potential adherence benefits of SPAA vs co-administered antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy in real-world settings (Table 1).
The second of these studies, the TOGETHER trial, evaluated whether targeting multiple CV risk factors with SPAA (5/20β€“10/20 mg) and TLC resulted in greater BP/lipid control and additional reduction in CVD risk in comparison with amlodipine (5β€“10 mg) plus TLC in patients with HTN and additional CV risk factors.
A single-pill combination of the antihypertensive amlodipine besylate and the lipid-lowering agent atorvastatin calcium (single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin [SPAA]), has been available in the USA since 2004 and in other parts of the world since 2005.
