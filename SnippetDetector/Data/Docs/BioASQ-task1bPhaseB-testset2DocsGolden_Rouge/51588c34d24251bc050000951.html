In this study we examined the association between TREM2 exon 2 variants and early-onset AD in a sample of Caucasian subjects of French origin including 726 patients with age of onset β‰¤65 years and 783 controls.
Possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis.
Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD),.
Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease.
We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set.
(TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Two recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
