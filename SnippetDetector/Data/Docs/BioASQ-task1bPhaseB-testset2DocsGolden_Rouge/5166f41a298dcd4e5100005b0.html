In general, histone methyltransferases (HMTs) have no widely approved high-throughput screening assay format, and therefore reference inhibitors are not available for many of the HMTs.
However, there are several selective HMT inhibitors: Trichostatin A (TSA), BIX-01294 and its derivative TM2-115, 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA), 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), Psammaplin A (PsA) and Sulforaphane (SFN).
