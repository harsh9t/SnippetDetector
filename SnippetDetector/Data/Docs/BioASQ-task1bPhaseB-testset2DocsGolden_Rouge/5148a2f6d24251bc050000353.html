Lithium, divalproex sodium, or topiramate may also be useful.
With the emergence of these novel treatments, the role of ablative surgery in CH has declined.
Based on our clinical experience, we recommended the combination of nasal sumatriptan for acute attacks and verapamil 240 mg/day for prophylaxis.
The cornerstone of maintenance prophylaxis is verapamil, yet methysergide, lithium, and divalproex sodium may also be employed.
Other drugs that may be used for this purpose include lithium carbonate, topiramate, valproic acid, gabapentin, and baclofen.
The calcium channel blocker verapamil is the drug of choice for CH prevention.
Most procedures are directed against the sensory trigeminal nerve and associated ganglia, eg, anesthetizing the sphenopalatine ganglion.
There are a variety of different medications for abortive and prophylactic therapy, accompanied by a variable amount of evidence-based medicine.
Recently, the therapeutic options for refractory CH patients have expanded with the emergence of both peripheral (mostly occipital nerve) and central (hypothalamic) neurostimulation.
Prophylactic therapy in most cases consisted of verapamil, also with a good response.
