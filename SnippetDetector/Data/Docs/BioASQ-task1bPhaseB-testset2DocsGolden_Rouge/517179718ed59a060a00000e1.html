Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target.
Bortezomib (PS-341) is a novel antineoplastic agent that is well tolerated at doses not exceeding 3.
0 mg (equivalent to 1.
75 mg/m2), repeated on D1 and D4 every other week.
Particular care should be taken with patients with preexisting neuropathy.
Preclinical studies currently being conducted by the National Cancer Institute against a panel of 60 cell lines show that BU-32 has broad anti-tumor activity (data not shown), and numerous biochemical studies are currently ongoing to investigate its efficacy as a single agent and in combination with other active anti-tumor agents against a variety of malignancies.
Biologic activity (inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B-related markers) and antitumor activity is seen in AIPCa at tolerated doses of bortezomib.
The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in this schedule is 1.
6 mg/m(2).
Our results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for AME-, AML1/MDS1-, MDS1/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers.
