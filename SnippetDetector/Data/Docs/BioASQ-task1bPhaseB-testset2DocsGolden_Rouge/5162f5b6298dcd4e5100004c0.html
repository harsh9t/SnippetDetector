Yes.
It has been demonstrated that induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and defects in overall DSBs repair capacity can lead to an accumulation of mutations, resulting in genomic instability of cells.
Given that genomic instability is the hallmark of cancer, DSBs play a causal role in carcinogenesis.
