The Aft1 transcription factor regulates the iron regulon in response to iron availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Aft1 activates a battery of genes required for iron uptake under iron-starved conditions, whereas Aft1 function is inactivated under iron-replete conditions.
Aft1 interacts with  the FOB (ferrioxamine B) transporter Arn3 and may regulate the ubiquitination of Arn3 in the cytosolic compartment.
Aft1 has been implicated in numerous cellular processes including cell-cycle progression and chromosome stability.
Aft1 has also been shown to affect a diverse range of cellular processes, including the RIM101 pH pathway, cell-wall stability, DNA damage, protein transport, chromosome stability, mitochondrial function, while it was recently shown to interact with the kinetochore protein Iml3 and to promote pericentromeric cohesin.
