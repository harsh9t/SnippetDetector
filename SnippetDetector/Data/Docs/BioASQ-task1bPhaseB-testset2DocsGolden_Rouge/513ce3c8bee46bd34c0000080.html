The genes that are most commonly linked to craniosynostoses are the members of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor family FGFR3 and to a lesser extent FGFR1 and FGFR2.
Some variants of the disease have been associated with the triplication of the MSX2 gene and mutations in NELL-1.
NELL-1 is being regulated bu RUNX2, which has also been associated to cases of craniosynostosis.
Other genes reported to have a role in the development of the disease are RECQL4, TWIST, SOX6 and GNAS.
