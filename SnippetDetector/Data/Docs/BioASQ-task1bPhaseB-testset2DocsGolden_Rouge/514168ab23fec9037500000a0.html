The main positive transcriptional regulator of Glycolysis in mammals is HIF1-alpha (Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1a).
HIF1-alpha is upregulated by the oncogenes c-Myc and Src, which therefore also positively regulate glycolysis.
Several reports have linked HIF-1Ξ± induction with STAT3 activation.
SIRT6 appears to function as a corepressor of the transcription factor Hif1alpha.
NF-ΞΊB also stimulates glycolysis through the inhibition of PDK4 expression.
Loss of the widely expressed transcription factor Oct1 induces a coordinated metabolic shift: mitochondrial activity and amino acid oxidation are increased, while glucose metabolism is reduced.
HNF4alpha is critical for regulating glucose transport and glycolysis and in doing so is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis.
