The Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire, The Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Poststroke Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression scale appeared to have acceptable psychometric properties for identifying depression in patients after stroke.
Therefore, these scales can be used for screening of post-stroke depression.
Signs of Depression Scale and Visual Analogue Mood Scale showed inferior psychometric properties and therefore should not be used for screening for post-stroke depression.
