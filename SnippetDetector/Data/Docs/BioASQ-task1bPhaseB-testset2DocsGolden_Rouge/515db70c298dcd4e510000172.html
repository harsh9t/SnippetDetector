The behavioral problems were sufficiently severe to require discontinuation of GBP despite moderately improved seizure control.
These behavioral changes consisted of intensification of baseline behaviors as well as new behavioral problems.
Its safety and tolerability profile is excellent for treatment of simple and complex partial crises, with or without generalization in epileptic patients of all ages.
No clinically important changes in laboratory assessments or other safety parameters were observed.
However, their incidence was low and intensity mild.
All behavioral changes were reversible and were managed by dose reduction or discontinuation of GBP.
These consisted of hyperactivity, irritability, and agitation that occurred in patients with baseline mental retardation with attention deficit.
Behaviors that parents considered most troublesome were tantrums, aggression directed toward others, hyperactivity, and defiance.
We described 3 learning disabled children, 1 aged 7 and 2 aged 10 years, with intractable partial seizures who developed severe behavioral problems while receiving modest doses of GBP.
Two studies were conducted to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in healthy subjects age 1 month to 12 years and to guide dose selection in safety and efficacy trials in pediatric patients.
