The pluripotency sustaining factor Nanog, controls a cascade of pathways that are intricately connected to govern pluripotency, self-renewal, genome surveillance and cell fate determination.
Elevated expression of Nanog has also been reported to result in clonal expansion of murine ESCs, but it also plays a role in tumor development.
A positive regulator of cell proliferation, it is essential for G1 to S transition in human embryonic stem cells while it regulates primordial germ cell migration.
