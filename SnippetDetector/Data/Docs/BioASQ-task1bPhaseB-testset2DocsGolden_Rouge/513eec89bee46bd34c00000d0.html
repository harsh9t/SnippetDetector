Expansins are extracellular proteins that increase plant cell-wall extensibility.
These wall-loosening proteins are involved in cell wall extension and polysaccharide degradation.
In fungi expansins and expansin-like proteins have been found to localize in the conidial cell wall and are probably involved in cell wall remodeling during germination.
