We suggest that the PSDRS could be a useful tool in clinical practice and in therapeutic trials.
The balance of sensitivity and specificity was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.
Proxy ratings should be used with caution, and the use of the Visual Analogue Mood Scale among patients with aphasia and other cognitive impairments cannot be recommended.
Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of the PSDRS was higher in respect of the Ham-D in aphasic patients.
The psychiatrist classified 25/71 (35.
2%) patients as depressed.
At their optimum cut-off points, the Ham-D and PSDRS showed good sensitivity and specificity for MDL or MDL + MDDM; the PSDRS had a higher positive predictive value for MDL in respect of the Ham-D (78 vs.
59%).
The Ham-D and PSDRS are both reliable diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of PSD.
Preliminary data suggests the CESD, HDRS or the PHQ-9 as the most promising options.
Using the recommended cut-point of 2 or more on the Signs of Depression Scale, the nurse and carer respectively rated 27/71 (38.
0%) and 18/30 (60.
0%) patients as potentially depressed.
