Compared to protein coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) display a bias towards two-exon transcripts.
They are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleous.
They are lower expressed and display a more tissue-specific expression pattern.
LncRNAs are overall more weakly conserved than protein coding genes.
