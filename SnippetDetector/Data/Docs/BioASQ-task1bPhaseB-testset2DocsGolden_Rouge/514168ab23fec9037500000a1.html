PVHL is a regulator of glucose metabolism.
C-Myc regulates genes involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes and mitochondria, and regulation of glucose and glutamine metabolism.
Several reports have linked HIF-1Ξ± induction with STAT3 activation.
Myc regulates gene expression either directly, such as glycolytic genes including lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA).
The inhibition of PDK4 expression by NF-ΞΊB is related to the shift towards increased glycolysis that is observed during cardiac pathological processes induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.
Functionally, we have shown that glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and cellular respiratory systems are altered in response to changes in Ets-1 expression.
The oxygen sensor HIF-1Ξ± is a highly unstable protein that becomes stabilized under hypoxia, leading to the activation of glycolysis and the down-regulation of mitochondrial respiration.
The HIF-1 dependent genic products are involved in tumoral angiogenesis, in the metabolic switch to anaerobic glycolysis and in prosurvival, proliferative and apoptotic mechanisms.
NF-ΞΊB inhibition causes cellular reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis under basal conditions and induces necrosis on glucose starvation.
SIRT6-deficient cells exhibit increased Hif1alpha activity and show increased glucose uptake with upregulation of glycolysis and diminished mitochondrial respiration.
