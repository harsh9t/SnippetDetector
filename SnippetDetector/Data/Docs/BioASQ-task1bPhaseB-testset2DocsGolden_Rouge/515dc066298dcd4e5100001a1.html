Additional investigation of the efficacy of this therapeutic intervention in this population is warranted.
Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress.
METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at least 3 organs.
Although how hypothermia confers neuroprotection is not fully understood, hypothermia reduces cerebral metabolism, inhibits glutamate release, preserves high energy phosphates, reduces neuronal nitric oxide production, preserves endogenous antioxidants, and ameliorates apoptotic neuronal death in experimental models.
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) whole-body hypothermia trial9, demonstrated a 28% relative reduction in death or moderate or severe disability at 18 to 22 months in hypothermia-treated infants compared with control infants.
We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a randomized trial.
Therapeutic hypothermia is a recognized treatment for term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities.
