The CARPE-M study provided further insight into the potential adherence benefits of SPAA, by investigating the impact of prior CCB and statin use on adherence to SPAA.
UMPIRE, running in India and three European countries (England, Ireland and the Netherlands), is an open, randomised, controlled trial designed to include 1000 participants in India and 1000 in Europe, with a followup of 12-24 months.
The Cluster Randomized Usual Care vs Caduet Investigation Assessing Long-term-risk (CRUCIAL trial) will be discussed in detail (Figure 1).
The CRUCIAL study is the only long-term randomized comparative trial of SPAA.
21 CRUCIAL was a 12-month, international, multicenter, prospective, open-label, parallel design, cluster-randomized trial conducted in 19 countries in four geographical regions, including Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America, between March 2007 and October 2009 (Figure 1).
