Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)  in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities in term or late preterm infants.
It remains unclear to what degree preterm infants were included in these studies.
A prospective non-randomised pilot study reported that mild hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC (necrotising enterocolitis) seems both feasible and safe.
