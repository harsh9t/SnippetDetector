Of the 17 Paediatric Investigation Plans submitted, 14 have resulted in an EMA Decision, 3 were withdrawn by the applicants, 8 were granted a full waiver from development, and 1 resulted in a negative opinion.
Paediatric Investigations Plans (PIPs) submitted with a Decision (outcome) reached between September 2007 and March 2010 were included in the analysis.
Decisions as issued included 15 clinical trials, with at least 1,282 children to be recruited into studies across five different products.
CONCLUSIONS: The small number of submissions indicates a lack of new drugs being developed for the management of pain.
Neonates were included in four of the products.
Ethical concerns that too many vulnerable children will be recruited into clinical trials must be balanced against limiting the number of off-label prescribing and obtaining age-appropriate information on paediatric use.
