Fetal echogenic bowel (FEB) is a soft marker found on second trimester sonography.
(PMID: 22990134) A disorder was diagnosed in 32.
2% of the fetuses, cystic fibrosis being the most commonly identified (7.
6%).
We also found digestive malformations (7.
0%), chromosomal abnormalities (3.
7%), and maternofetal infections (3.
7%).
(PMID: 20932506) Brightly echogenic bowel in the second trimester was found to be associated with a significant risk of fetal aneuploidy.
(PMID: 1415421) echogenic bowel does not uniformly herald an abnormal outcome.
Echogenic bowel coexistent with other abnormalities (such as growth deficiency or structural malformations) may be a comarker for aneuploidy.
(PMID: 8142051) 112 cases (57%) had a known etiology, which included chromosomal abnormality (7%), infection (4%), cystic fibrosis (1.
5%), bowel abnormality (3%), bleeding or stained amniotic fluid (11%), Doppler abnormality (14%), malformation (16%) and miscellaneous (0.
5%) (PMID: 12835583).
