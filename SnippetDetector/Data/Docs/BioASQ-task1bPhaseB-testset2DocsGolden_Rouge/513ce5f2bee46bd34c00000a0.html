Prevalence of Cystic Fibrosis varies according to the population.
A theoretical estimate of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis based on anthropological data suggested a frequency of 25 affected individuals/100,000 inhabitants.
However, real data indicated that the true prevalence in the population was considerably lower (6.
9 cases/100,000 inhabitants).
Results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.
737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.
797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.
98.
