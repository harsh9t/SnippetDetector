DNA (Cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues.
Given that methylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters leads to carcinogenesis, inhibition of DNA (Cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases is a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer.
There are several inhibitors of DNA (Cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases that uses different modes of action: 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR, VidazaΒ®), 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR, decitabine, DacogenΒ®), 5-azacytosine (ZCyt), 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC), 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine (DZCyt), 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine, hydralazine, 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine), 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone (zebularine aglycon), procaine, procainamide, psammaplin A, and RSC133, a new synthetic derivative of indoleacrylic acid/indolepropionic acid.
