PE, in the absence of T3, resulted in 5.
0 fold increase in TRalpha1 expression in nucleus and 2.
0 fold decrease in TRalpha1 expression in cytosol, P<0.
05.
This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process.
Nuclear TRalpha1 is overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by PE.
