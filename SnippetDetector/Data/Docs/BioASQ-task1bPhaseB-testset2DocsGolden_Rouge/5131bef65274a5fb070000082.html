Using H3K4me2 as a mark for active enhancers (PMID: 22270183) Hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4, a mark of active chromatin, is established broadly across target loci by enhancers that function over long distances (PMID: 19021773) The enhancer region itself was marked by mono-methylation at K4 and K9, distinguishing it from the methyl marks in the gene coding region (PMID: 19021773) H3K4 methylation to monovalent and bivalent domains (PMID: 20621055).
