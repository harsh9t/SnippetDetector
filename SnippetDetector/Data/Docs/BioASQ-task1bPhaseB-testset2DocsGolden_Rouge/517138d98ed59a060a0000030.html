Ranolazine has only a small effect on the basal calcium current, while it greatly affects whole cell calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor activation.
Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload.
Ranolazine reduces Ca2+ overload and LV mechanical dysfunction during ischemia/reperfusion.
ranolazine decreases  I(Na,L)-induced dysregulation of calcium cycling that contributes to the antiarrhythmic actions of this agent.
ranolazine desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2 activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations.
ranolazine ameliorates the Ca(2+) response and cross-bridge kinetics of cardiac myofilaments.
