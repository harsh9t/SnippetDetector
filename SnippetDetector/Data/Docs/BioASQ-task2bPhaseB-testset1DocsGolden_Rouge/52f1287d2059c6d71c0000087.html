Counting depends on the X inactivation center, which contains the Xist gene encoding a nuclear RNA, which coats the inactive X chromosome and induces gene silencing.
One example for antisense regulation is the Xist and Tsix gene pair, which is pivotal in X-inactivation.
We have found that mouse regions of the Tsix gene major promoter and minisatellite repeat DXPas34 are conserved among rodents.
Therefore, the repression of Xist by mouse Tsix has no counterpart in humans, and TSIX is not the gene that protects the active X chromosome from random inactivation.
One of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells is subject to inactivation initiated by the Xist gene.
By contrast, marsupial XCI is imprinted to occur on the paternal X chromosome.
TSIX is transcribed only from the inactive X chromosome and is coexpressed with XIST.
In the mouse placenta, where X inactivation is imprinted, the maternal Xist allele is repressed by a cis-acting antisense transcript, encoded by the Tsix gene.
The XIST allele must be turned off on one X chromosome to maintain its activity in cells of both sexes.
We have addressed the role of these elements in counting by using male ES cells.
