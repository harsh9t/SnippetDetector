ranscription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene correction in integration-free Ξ²-thalassemia induced pluripotent stem cells  al-effector nucleases (TALENs) are engineered proteins that can stimulate precise genome editing through specific DNA double-strand breaks.
Sickle cell disease and Ξ²-thalassemia are common genetic disorders caused by mutations in Ξ²-globin, and we engineered a pair of highly active TALENs that induce modification of 54% of human Ξ²-globin alleles near the site of the sickle mutation.
These TALENS stimulate targeted integration of therapeutic, full-length beta-globin cDNA to the endogenous Ξ²-globin locus in 19% of cells prior to selection as quantified by single molecule real-time sequencing.
