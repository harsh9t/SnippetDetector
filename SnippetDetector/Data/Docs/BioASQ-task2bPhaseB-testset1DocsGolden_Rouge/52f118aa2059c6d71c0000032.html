Human cells can process DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by either homology directed or non-homologous repair pathways.
Defects in components of DSB repair pathways are associated with a predisposition to cancer.
The products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which normally confer protection against breast cancer, are involved in homology-directed DSB repair.
PALB2 interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2 in supercomplexes involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination.
Heterozygous germline mutations in PALB2 confer a moderate risk of breast cancer, while biallelic PALB2 mutations are linked to a severe form of Fanconi anaemia characterized by early childhood solid tumours and severe chromosomal instability.
