For efficient genetic transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have been used successfully.
However, these methods suffer from many disadvantages especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene silencing.
To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes.
Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli.
Determination of insertion sites and adjacent viral sequences identify the BAC clones for genetic manipulation and functional characterization.
