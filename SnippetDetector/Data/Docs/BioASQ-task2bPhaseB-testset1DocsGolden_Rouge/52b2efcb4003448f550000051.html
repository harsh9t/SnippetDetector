Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children).
There was evidence of mixed hearing loss in the four children, but only of sensorineural hearing loss in the adults.
We believe that the persistent hearing loss in achondroplasia is not due to sequelae of otitis media as some authors have suggested.
