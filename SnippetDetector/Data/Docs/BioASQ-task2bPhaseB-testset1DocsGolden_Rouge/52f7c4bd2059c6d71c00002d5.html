No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality  These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice.
Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH.
Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1.
This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a prolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation in TRΞ±1.
