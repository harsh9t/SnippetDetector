CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study showed associations between the THRA rs939348 polymorphism and systolic BP and the risk of hypertension but not with CHD, although we admit that the statistical power available to study any relationship with CHD was very limited.
RESULTS: Individuals carrying the rs939348 T allele had higher systolic BP than CC individuals in both the MONICA Lille ( P = 0.
02 ) and Toulouse ( P = 0.
03 ) studies.
As the TH receptor - has been associated with many of TH actions on the cardiovascular system in mice models, we hypothesized that it could be involved in the latter.
We thus tested whether polymorphisms in TR - could be associated with BP level variation.
Here, we describe a previously unknown population of parvalbuminergic neurons in the anterior hypothalamus that requires thyroid hormone receptor signaling for proper development.
Specific stereotaxic ablation of these cells in the mouse resulted in hypertension and temperature-dependent tachycardia, indicating a role in the central autonomic control of blood pressure and heart rate.
Recent evidence suggests that the hormone also regulates these systems indirectly through the central nervous system.
Thyroid hormone is well known for its profound direct effects on cardiovascular function and metabolism.
