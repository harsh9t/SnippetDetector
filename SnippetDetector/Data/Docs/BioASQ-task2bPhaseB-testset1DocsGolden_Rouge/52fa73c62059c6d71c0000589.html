A growing number of patients are recognized to have chronic kidney disease.
Types 1 and 2 involve acute and chronic cardiovascular disease scenarios leading to acute kidney injury or accelerated chronic kidney disease.
The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
There is a strong association between both acute and chronic dysfunction of the heart and kidneys with respect to morbidity and mortality.
Presumably, a combination of tissue and urine biomarkers will be more informative than individual markers.
Several biomarkers emerged recently that are able to detect kidney damage earlier than is currently possible with traditional biomarkers such as serum creatinine and proteinuria.
Cardiorenal syndromes have been subclassified as five defined entities which represent clinical circumstances in which both the heart and the kidney are involved in a bidirectional injury and dysfunction via a final common pathway of cell-to-cell death and accelerated apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress.
Thus, there has been a recent effort to identify new biomarkers that reflect kidney function, early injury, and/or repair that ultimately can relate to progression or regression of damage.
