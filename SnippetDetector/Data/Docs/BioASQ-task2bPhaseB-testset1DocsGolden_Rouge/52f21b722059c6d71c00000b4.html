Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene.
Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %).
Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages.
Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations.
