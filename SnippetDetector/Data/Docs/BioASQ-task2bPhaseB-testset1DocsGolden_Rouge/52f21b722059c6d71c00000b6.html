Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene.
Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %).
Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations.
This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer.
