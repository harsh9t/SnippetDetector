Albeit, the precise molecular mechanism is still obscure it has been shown that Tsix transcription regulates the chromatin structure by altering histone tail modifications and DNA methylation at the Xist promoter.
In addition, Xist and Tsix RNA form an RNA duplexes in vivo and are processed to small RNAs, which have a potential regulatory function.
Xist works as a functional RNA molecule that recruits repressive chromatin factors towards one of the female Xs for inactivation.
A 37-kb sequence lying 3' to the Xist gene is known to prevent initiation of XCI in male differentiating ES cells.
This region contains the major and minor promoters of the Tsix gene, which runs antisense to Xist.
In eutherian mammals, random XCI of the soma requires a master regulatory locus known as the 'X-inactivation center' (XIC/Xic), wherein lies the noncoding XIST/Xist silencer RNA and its regulatory antisense Tsix gene.
The XIST allele must be turned off on one X chromosome to maintain its activity in cells of both sexes.
One of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells is subject to inactivation (XCI) initiated by the Xist gene.
