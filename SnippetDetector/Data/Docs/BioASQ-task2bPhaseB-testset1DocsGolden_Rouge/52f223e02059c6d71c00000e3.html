Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), characterized by skin neurofibromas and an excess of cafΓ©-au-lait spots, is due to mutations in the neurofibromin (NF1) gene.
Identifying the genetic defect in individuals with the disease represents a significant challenge because the gene is extremely large with a high incidence of sporadic mutations across the entire gene ranging from single nucleotide substitutes to large deletions.
Characterization of the somatic mutational spectrum of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene in neurofibromatosis patients with benign and malignant tumors.
