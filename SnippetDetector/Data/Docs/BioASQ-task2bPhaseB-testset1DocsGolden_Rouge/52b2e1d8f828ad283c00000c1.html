Glibenclamide (INN), also known as glyburide (USAN), is an antidiabetic drug in a class of medications known as sulfonylureas, closely related to sulfa drugs.
It is used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Additionally, recent research shows that glibenclamide improves outcome in animal stroke models by preventing brain swelling[7] and enhancing neuroprotection.

(PMID: 22639778) Potency of TFG in restoring several parameters to normal values is comparable to glibenclamide, though not as efficient as insulin, an indication of its antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect.
