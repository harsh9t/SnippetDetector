TpA is the most underepresented dinucleotide followed closely by CpG.
For trinucleotides, GCA/TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA/TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences.
For higher lengts alternating Purine/Pyrimidine tracts are underepresented up to 60%.
