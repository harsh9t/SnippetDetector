Thalassemia is genetic diseases of the blood caused by mutations in the globin gene.
Main goal for thalassemia treatment is to develop homologous recombination based gene therapy in order to cure these diseases.
Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) are proper targets for the human globin gene.
Genome editing using engineered nucleases such as ZFNs and TALENs has become a powerful technology for reverse genetics.
