Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome affecting approximately 1 in 4,000 persons.
It is an autosomal-dominant disorder with half of the cases resulting from spontaneous mutations.
(PMID: 16323217) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), characterized by skin neurofibromas and an excess of cafe-au-lait spots, is due to mutations in the neurofibromin (NF1) gene.
Identifying the genetic defect in individuals with the disease represents a significant challenge because the gene is extremely large with a high incidence of sporadic mutations across the entire gene ranging from single nucleotide substitutes to large deletions.
