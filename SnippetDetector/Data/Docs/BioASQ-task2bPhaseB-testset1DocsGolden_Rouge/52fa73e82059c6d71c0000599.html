Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes.
Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli.
Determination of insertion sites and adjacent viral sequences identify the BAC clones for genetic manipulation and functional characterization.
(PMID: 18988631) Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis.
As demonstrated here, the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence elements.
(PMID: 19594452) For efficient genetic transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have been used successfully.
However, these methods suffer from many disadvantages especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene silencing.
To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes.
