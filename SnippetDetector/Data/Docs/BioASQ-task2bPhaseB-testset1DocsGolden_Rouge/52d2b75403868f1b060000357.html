We propose the incorporation of chromatin insulators in the design of gene therapy vectors to overcome the problem of position effects.
Our data have important implications in understanding the molecular basis of insulator function and design of gene therapy vectors.
Insertional mutagenesis has emerged as a major obstacle for gene therapy based on vectors that integrate randomly in the genome.
Low efficiency of gene transfer is the main obstacle for a clinically effective gene therapy at the level of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell.
Another important aspect of stem cell gene therapy, the actual expression of the transduced genes, has only been investigated adequately in very few studies, mainly for globin genes.
Chromatin insulators separate active transcriptional domains and block the spread of heterochromatin in the genome.
The design and incorporation of effective chromatin insulator sequences in the next generation of gene therapy vectors should lead to improved and more predictable expression of therapeutic transgenes and constitute an important step toward clinically effective gene therapy.
Identification of insulators with minimal promoter specificity would also be of great value.
Chromatin insulators are protein-binding DNA elements that lack intrinsic promoter/enhancer activity but shelter genes from transcriptional influence of surrounding chromatin.
