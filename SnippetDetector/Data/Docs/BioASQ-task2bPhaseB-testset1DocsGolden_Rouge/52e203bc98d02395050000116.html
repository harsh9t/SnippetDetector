Unusual frequencies of certain alternating purine-pyrimidine runs in natural DNA sequences.
An unexpectedly high proportion of these octamers consists of alternating tetramers with the repeat structure (PuPyPuPy)2 or (PyPuPyPu)2.
One such pattern recognition system is based on unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in particular sequence contexts (CpG motifs); these motifs are common in bacterial DNA but are under-represented ("CpG suppression") and methylated in vertebrate DNA.
For trinucleotides, GCA.
TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.
TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences.
The dinucleotide CpG is significantly under-represented in vertebrate DNA and is usually methylated.
We argue that the significant under-represented motif pattern of CpG in an AU context--which is found in both the ssRNA viruses and innate genes, and has decreased throughout the history of H1N1 influenza replication in humans--is immunostimulatory and has been selected against during the co-evolution of viruses and host innate immune genes.
Octanucleotides are the most deficient, occurring at only 60% of the frequency expected in random sequences.
