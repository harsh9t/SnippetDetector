RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel agent that is being trialled in the treatment of neuro-endocrine tumours, and is known to interact with mTOR.
(PMID: 18025810) Octreotide and the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) block proliferation and interact with the Akt-mTOR-p70S6K pathway (PMID: 18025810) The introduction of the inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin sirolimus and everolimus in renal transplantation has increased the repertoire of immunosuppressive protocols substantially.
(PMID: 17890266) mTOR inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus.
(PMID: 19299048) mTOR inhibitors such as Temsirolimus (CCI779) and Everolimus (RAD001) are effective for suppressing cell growth with inhibiting mTOR kinase activity.
These agents have an inhibitory activity against the mTORC1 complex.
(PMID: 19620795) The mTOR pathway, and its upstream regulators in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT cascade, are altered in a variety of experimental and human malignancies.
This has led to the prediction that mTOR inhibitors may be used as anticancer agents.
With the recent approval of two mTOR-targeted drugs (temsirolimus and everolimus) for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma, this paradigm has been effectively translated into the clinical setting.
