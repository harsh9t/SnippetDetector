Although most cases are sporadic, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is well documented.
This report presents the first example of male transmission of Apert acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome.
Female transmission has been reported in the five previous well-documented cases of dominant inheritance of the syndrome.
