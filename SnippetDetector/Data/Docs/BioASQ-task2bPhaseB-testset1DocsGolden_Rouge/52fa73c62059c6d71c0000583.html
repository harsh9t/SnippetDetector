Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine.
Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention.
The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the related health-care expenditures.
