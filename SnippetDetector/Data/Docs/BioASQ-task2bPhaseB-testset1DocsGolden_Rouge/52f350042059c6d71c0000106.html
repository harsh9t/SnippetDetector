AIM OF STUDY: An analysis of incidences of selected birth defects in the Czech Republic in 2000 - 2008 period.
TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective epidemiological analysis of birth defects incidences in births and total birth defects incidences from the Czech National Birth Defects Register database.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on pre - and postnatally diagnosed birth defects in the Czech Republic during 1994-2007 were used.
AIM OF STUDY: An analysis of prenatal diagnostics efficiency of selected types of chromosomal aberrations in the Czech Republic in 2007.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the maternal age-specific live birth prevalence of trisomy 13 ( Patau syndrome ) and trisomy 18 ( Edwards syndrome ) and compare it with that of trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ).
Ten cases of chromosomal abnormalities were detected in the Edwards screen positive.
The aim of the study was the analysis of indications for genetic amniocenteses carried out in the last 5 years and in case of which trisomy of chromosome 18 was diagnosed.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of the prenatal screening and diagnostic program for the detection of the common autosomal trisomies in the North West Thames region prior to the introduction of serum screening.
The incidence of Edwards syndrome is 1:5000 of live-born.
