The protective effect of repeated exposure to the ameliorating hormonal and immunological changes of pregnancy may counterbalance the effect of early exposure to the postpartum reversal of these changes.
An early age at first birth increased the odds, and the postpartum period was confirmed as high risk for RA onset.
In this unique population, greater parity significantly reduced the odds of RA;.
It appears that infertility, the number of pregnancies, and pregnancy outcome are not strongly associated with the risk of developing RA in women of childbearing age.
Thus, a true association could have been missed.
A larger number of pregnancies and late menopause show a protective effect, delaying the onset of the disease.
Literature review shows that at best, there are weak negative associations between current estrogen use and RA, and no association with nulliparity and infertility.
Number of pregnancies and children, however, were significantly higher in controls.
Most other published studies find no association between nulliparity and RA.
We found an inverse correlation between the number of pregnancies and age at onset of RA.
