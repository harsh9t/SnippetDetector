The incidence of Edwards syndrome is 1:5000 of live-born.
the incidence of chromosome mutations increases with the presence of mutagenic factors.
METHODS: The study included all cases of Patau, Edwards and Down syndrome, delivered during 1985-2003 and resident in the former Northern Region of England, including terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly.
We determined the incidence and karyotype of chromosomal abnormalities in screen positive women and evaluated a relationship between chromosomal and ultrasonographic abnormalities.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the maternal age-specific live birth prevalence of trisomy 13 ( Patau syndrome ) and trisomy 18 ( Edwards syndrome ) and compare it with that of trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ).
AIM OF STUDY: An analysis of incidences of selected birth defects in the Czech Republic in 2000 - 2008 period.
Edwards syndrome occurs in 1: 8000 live births and is closely related to the mother's age.
Edwards syndrome which is trisomy of chromosome 18 with poor prognosis.
RESULTS: The study analyzed 116 cases of Patau syndrome, 240 cases of Edwards syndrome and 1084 cases of Down syndrome.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether older paternal age increases the risk of fathering a pregnancy with Patau, Edwards ( trisomy 18 ), Klinefelter ( XXY ) or XYY syndrome.
