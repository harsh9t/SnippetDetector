We report that low percentages of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in liquid chromatography solvents lead to a strong enhancement of electrospray ionization of peptides, improving the sensitivity of protein identification in bottom-up proteomics by up to tenfold.
(PMID: 23975139) We found that the quantitative precisions improved significantly when DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) was added to the matrix solution.
(PMID: 18393531) Introducing to the 80% formic acid injection solution an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or acetonitrile-DMSO induced further retention selectivity, and increasing levels of organic solvents reduced on-column retention.
