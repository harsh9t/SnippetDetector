Human cells can process DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by either homology directed or non-homologous repair pathways.
Defects in components of DSB repair pathways are associated with a predisposition to cancer.
The products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which normally confer protection against breast cancer, are involved in homology-directed DSB repair.
