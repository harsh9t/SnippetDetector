Major changes of their life style were investigated.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that life style changes which related to migration might reduce DNA damage in Hasake nationalities.
The aim of the study was to determine the existence of oxidative stress and its possible consequences in female patients with CFS.
A strong positive correlation between oxidative stress and insulin resistance was observed in metabolic syndrome.
Antioxidant treatment and life style changes are indicated for women with CFS, as well as closer observation in order to assess the degree of atherosclerosis.
Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome suggests that besides therapeutic life style changes as suggested in ATP III guidelines inclusion of antioxidant vitamins, fruits and vegetable could be beneficial to ward off the consequences of metabolic syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of migration and oxidative DNA damage by comparative study of oxidative DNA damage effects on people with different years of migration among Xinjiang Hasake ethnicity in Shenzhen.
CONCLUSIONS: The CFS group had an unfavorable lipid profile and signs of oxidative stress induced damage to lipids and proteins.
Continued robust oxidative stress may induce pericyte apoptosis and impaired cellular longevity.
