Effective treatment options are still under investigation.
The main bulk of experimental pharmacological interventions addressing the clinical problem of frailty have been focused on the use of hormones, as replacement therapy in subjects with low or normal circulating basal levels of the hormone.
The effectiveness of other potential therapeutic interventions (antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, nutritional supplements) appears to be limited or has not been explored in detail until now.
Results have been disappointing, except for the case of testosterone that have shown some benefits.
Design of therapeutic interventions for geriatric frailty has been challenging and may be because of inadequate understanding of its biological underpinnings.
