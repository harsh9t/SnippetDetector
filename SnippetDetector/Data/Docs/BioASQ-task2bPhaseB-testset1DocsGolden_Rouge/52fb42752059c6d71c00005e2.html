In the current study, we investigated the effect of a natural thyroid hormone analogue - 3, 3?, 5-triiodo-thyroacetic acid (TRIAC) on regulating proliferation and differentiation and its possible molecular mechanism in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and C57BL/6 mice.
Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of the TH analog 3,5,3 ,5 -tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) as a replacement for T(4) in brain development.
TRIAC was effective and safe in ameliorating the effects of hyperthyroidism and ADHD symptoms in a child with known genetic RTH.
This treatment was sufficient to promote TH-dependent neuronal differentiation in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum but was ineffective in suppressing hypothalamic TRH expression.
