We found an inverse correlation between the number of pregnancies and age at onset of RA  It appears that infertility, the number of pregnancies, and pregnancy outcome are not strongly associated with the risk of developing RA in women of childbearing age.
However, in this study there may have been selection biases in the women with RA and the controls that differentially could have affected their reproductive outcomes.
Thus, a true association could have been missed.
Most other published studies find no association between nulliparity and RA.
