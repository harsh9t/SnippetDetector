Eukaryotic gene expression is dependent on the modification of the first transcribed nucleotide of pre-mRNA by the addition of the 7-methylguanosine cap.
Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript.
Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT ( RNA guanylyltransferase and 5 ' phosphatase ) and RNMT ( RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase ).
Myc proteins also up-regulate translation by increasing addition of the 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5 ' end of pre-mRNA.
The authors discovered that in addition to regulating mRNA abundance, c-Myc regulates the formation of the 7-methylguanosine cap on many mRNAs, including transcriptional target genes and others not transcriptionally activated.
The product of the partially purified enzyme using vaccinia mRNA as substrate was exclusively 7-methylguanosine located in the terminal dinucleoside triphosphate.
This enzyme was able to catalyze the methylation of GTP to m7GTP in vitro whereas the cellular enzyme could not methylate GTP.
One additional 32P-labeled protein was detected in alphavirus-infected cells but only in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine.
This protein was identified as the nonstructural protein nsP1.
