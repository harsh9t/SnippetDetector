Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance.
Two thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them.
Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease.
So far it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2.
TSC1 encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34 and was discovered in 1997.
TSC2 encodes for the protein Tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.
3 and was discovered in 1993.
TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD).
Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop PKD in childhood.
TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC.
However, the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the mutation clinically.
Estimates of the proportion of TSC caused by TSC2 range from 55% to 80-90%.
