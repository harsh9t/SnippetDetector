mutations in the gene encoding for cardiac calsequestrin, CASQ2, cause a rare but severe form of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) (PMID: 22421959) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is an inherited disease that predisposes to cardiac arrest and sudden death.
The disease is associated with mutations in the genes encoding for the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2).
(PMID: 22298808) Traditionally regarded as a genetic disease of the cardiac sarcomere, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease and a significant cause of sudden cardiac death.
mutations in RYR2-encoded ryanodine receptor 2, CASQ2-encoded calsequestrin 2, CALR3-encoded calreticulin 3, and SRI-encoded sorcin have been associated with HCM (PMID: 22515980).
