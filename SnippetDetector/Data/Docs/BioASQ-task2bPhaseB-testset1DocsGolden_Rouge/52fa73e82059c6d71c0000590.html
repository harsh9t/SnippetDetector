Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology.
New DNA may be inserted in the host genome by first isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using molecular cloning methods to generate a DNA sequence, or by synthesizing the DNA, and then inserting this construct into the host organism.
Genes may be removed, or "knocked out", using a nuclease.
Gene targeting is a different technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous gene, and can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, add a gene, or introduce point mutations.
Based on results there are developed many methods for genetic manipulation of cells such as Microinjection, electroporation, liposomes and via viral vectors.
