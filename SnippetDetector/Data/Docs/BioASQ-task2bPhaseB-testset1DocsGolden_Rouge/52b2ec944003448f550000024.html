Interestingly, several longevity genes such as SIRT1, SIRT6, and FoxOs can clearly suppress NF-kappaB signaling and in this way delay the aging process and extend lifespan.
Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival.
In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways.
We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process.
These observations link FoxO function in mammalian systems with the evolutionarily conserved role of FoxO in promotion of stress resistance and longevity in lower phylogenetic systems.
Furthermore, these findings have implications for aging in higher organisms and in malignant stem cell biology, and suggest that FoxOs may play an important role in the maintenance and integrity of stem cell compartments in a broad spectrum of tissues.
