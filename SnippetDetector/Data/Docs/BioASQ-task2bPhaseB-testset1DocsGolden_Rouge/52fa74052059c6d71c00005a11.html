We showed that the correction process did not generate TALEN-induced off targeting mutations by sequencing.
More importantly, the gene-corrected - Thal iPS cell lines from each patient can be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells and then further to erythroblasts expressing normal - globin.
We generated integration-free and gene-corrected iPSC lines from two patients carrying different types of homozygous mutations and showed that these iPSCs are pluripotent and have normal karyotype.
The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and subsequent correction of the disease-causing mutations offer an ideal therapeutic solution to this problem.
It is estimated that 4.
5 % of the population in the world carry - Thal mutants, posing a persistent threat to public health.
Sickle cell disease and - thalassemia are common genetic disorders caused by mutations in - globin, and we engineered a pair of highly active TALENs that induce modification of 54 % of human - globin alleles near the site of the sickle mutation.
These TALENS stimulate targeted integration of therapeutic, full-length beta-globin cDNA to the endogenous - globin locus in 19 % of cells prior to selection as quantified by single molecule real-time sequencing.
Tal-effector nucleases are engineered proteins that can stimulate precise genome editing through specific DNA double-strand breaks.
