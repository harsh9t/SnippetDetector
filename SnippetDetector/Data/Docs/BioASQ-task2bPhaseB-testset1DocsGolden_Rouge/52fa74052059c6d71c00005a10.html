Tal-effector nucleases are engineered proteins that can stimulate precise genome editing through specific DNA double-strand breaks.
It is estimated that 4.
5 % of the population in the world carry - Thal mutants, posing a persistent threat to public health.
The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and subsequent correction of the disease-causing mutations offer an ideal therapeutic solution to this problem.
More importantly, the gene-corrected - Thal iPS cell lines from each patient can be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells and then further to erythroblasts expressing normal - globin.
Sickle cell disease and - thalassemia are common genetic disorders caused by mutations in - globin, and we engineered a pair of highly active TALENs that induce modification of 54 % of human - globin alleles near the site of the sickle mutation.
- Thalassemia is a group of life-threatening blood disorders caused by either point mutations or deletions of nucleotides in - globin gene ( HBB ).
These TALENS stimulate targeted integration of therapeutic, full-length beta-globin cDNA to the endogenous - globin locus in 19 % of cells prior to selection as quantified by single molecule real-time sequencing.
We showed that the correction process did not generate TALEN-induced off targeting mutations by sequencing.
