Determination of insertion sites and adjacent viral sequences identify the BAC clones for genetic manipulation and functional characterization.
Plant Biotechnology involves manipulation of genetic material to develop better crops.
This system extends the repertoire of molecular genetic studies and biotechnological endeavors by enabling simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes.
at present, multigene transformation is very difficult due to technical limitations of existing methods.
For efficient genetic transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have been used successfully.
Bacterial artificial chromosomes derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes.
As demonstrated here, the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence elements.
Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis.
Keeping in view the challenges being faced by humanity in terms of shortage of food and other resources, we need to continuously upgrade the genomic technologies and fine tune the existing methods.
Introduction and expression of multiple transgenes is frequently required for basic and applied studies.
