al-effector nucleases (TALENs) are engineered proteins that can stimulate precise genome editing through specific DNA double-strand breaks.
Sickle cell disease and b-thalassemia are common genetic disorders caused by mutations in b-globin, and we engineered a pair of highly active TALENs that induce modification of 54% of human b-globin alleles near the site of the sickle mutation.
These TALENS stimulate targeted integration of therapeutic, full-length beta-globin cDNA to the endogenous b-globin locus in 19% of cells prior to selection as quantified by single molecule real-time sequencing.
