For trinucleotides, GCA.
TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.
TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences  For dinucleotides, TA is almost universally under-represented, with the exception of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, and CG is strongly under-represented in vertebrates and in mitochondrial genomes.
