Transcriptional silencing of the human inactive X chromosome is induced by the XIST gene within the human X-inactivation center.
The XIST allele must be turned off on one X chromosome to maintain its activity in cells of both sexes.
In the mouse placenta, where X inactivation is imprinted (the paternal X chromosome is always inactive), the maternal Xist allele is repressed by a cis-acting antisense transcript, encoded by the Tsix gene.
A counting process senses the X chromosome/autosome ratio and ensures that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiates in the early female (XX) embryo and in differentiating female ES cells but not in their male (XY) counterparts.
Counting depends on the X inactivation center (Xic), which contains the Xist gene encoding a nuclear RNA, which coats the inactive X chromosome and induces gene silencing.
A 37-kb sequence lying 3  to the Xist gene is known to prevent initiation of XCI in male differentiating ES cells.
This region contains the major and minor promoters of the Tsix gene, which runs antisense to Xist.
