Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis.
As demonstrated here, the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence elements.
Compared to existing methods, this new approach is highly efficient, and does not require any information on viral sequences or cloning of viral DNA fragments, and plaque purifications.
Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli.
This system extends the repertoire of molecular genetic studies and biotechnological endeavors by enabling simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes.
these methods suffer from many disadvantages especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene silencing.
To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes.
For efficient genetic transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have been used successfully.
