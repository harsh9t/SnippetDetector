Loxapine has been prescribed in France since 1980.
Its pharmacological profile is close to that of clozapine: it has dopamine (D2), histamine (H1), serotonin (5-HT2) and adrenergic (alpha 1)-blocking activities.
Its best indication seems to be paranoid schizophrenia, although some data suggest bipolar action.
