In mammals, cap synthesis is catalysed by the sequential action of RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5 -phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase), enzymes recruited to RNA pol II (polymerase II) during the early stages of transcription.
We recently discovered that the mammalian cap methyltransferase is a heterodimer consisting of RNMT and the RNMT-activating subunit RAM (RNMT-activating mini-protein).
RAM activates and stabilizes RNMT and thus is critical for cellular cap methylation and cell viability.
Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II (polymerase II) transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5  phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase).
The methylation of the 5  terminal guanosine residue of the cap structure of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mRNAs has been shown to occur in vitro concomitantly with their synthesis (R.

Gomatos, Virology, 114, 542-554, 1981).
The enzyme responsible for this methylation, a guanine-7-methyltransferase, is associated with the SFV replication complex  Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript.
