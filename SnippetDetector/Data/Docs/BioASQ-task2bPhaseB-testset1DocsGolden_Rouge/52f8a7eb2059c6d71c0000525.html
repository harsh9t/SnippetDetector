Association between nocturnal bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux.
Dental wear caused by association between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease:  Direct restorative treatment of dental erosion caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with bruxism:  Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
However, no robust evidence supports the association between SB and GERD.
