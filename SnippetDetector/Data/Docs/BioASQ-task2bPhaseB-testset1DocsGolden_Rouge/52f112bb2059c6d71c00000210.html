The RNMT N-terminal domain is required for transcript expression, translation and cell proliferation.
Gene expression in eukaryotes is dependent on the mRNA methyl cap which mediates mRNA processing and translation initiation.
In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1.
The enzyme also methylated the dinucleoside diphosphate G pppG but much less efficiently than G ( 5 ' ) pppG.
The methylation of the 5 ' terminal guanosine residue of the cap structure of Semliki Forest virus mRNAs has been shown to occur in vitro concomitantly with their synthesis ( R.

Gomatos, Virology, 114, 542-554, 1981 ).
The product of the partially purified enzyme using vaccinia mRNA as substrate was exclusively 7-methylguanosine located in the terminal dinucleoside triphosphate.
In mammals, cap synthesis is catalysed by the sequential action of RNGTT and RNMT ( RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase ), enzymes recruited to RNA pol II ( polymerase II ) during the early stages of transcription.
We recently discovered that the mammalian cap methyltransferase is a heterodimer consisting of RNMT and the RNMT-activating subunit RAM.
Eukaryotic gene expression is dependent on the modification of the first transcribed nucleotide of pre-mRNA by the addition of the 7-methylguanosine cap.
