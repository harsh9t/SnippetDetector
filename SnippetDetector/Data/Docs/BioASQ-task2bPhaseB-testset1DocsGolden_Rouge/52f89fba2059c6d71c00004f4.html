We report that low percentages of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in liquid chromatography solvents lead to a strong enhancement of electrospray ionization of peptides, improving the sensitivity of protein identification in bottom-up proteomics by up to tenfold.
We found that the quantitative precisions improved significantly when DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) was added to the matrix solution.
