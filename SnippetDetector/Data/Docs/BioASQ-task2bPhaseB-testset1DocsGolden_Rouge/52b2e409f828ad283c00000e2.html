Loxapine (Loxapac, Loxitane) is a typical antipsychotic medication, used primarily in the treatment of schizophrenia.
It is a member of the dibenzoxazepine class and structurally related to clozapine (which belongs to the chemically akin class of dibenzodiazepines).
Several researchers have argued that Loxapine may behave as an atypical antipsychotic.
(Wikipedia) Loxapine has been prescribed in France since 1980.
Its pharmacological profile is close to that of clozapine: it has dopamine (D2), histamine (H1), serotonin (5-HT2) and adrenergic (alpha 1)-blocking activities.
Its best indication seems to be paranoid schizophrenia, although some data suggest bipolar action.
