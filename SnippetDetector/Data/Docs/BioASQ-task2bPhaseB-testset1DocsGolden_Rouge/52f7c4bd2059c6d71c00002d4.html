No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality  These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice.
Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH.
