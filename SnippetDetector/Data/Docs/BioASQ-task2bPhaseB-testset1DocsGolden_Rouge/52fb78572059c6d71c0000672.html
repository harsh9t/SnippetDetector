Among 5,511 males, 69 subjects (1.
25%) exhibited QTc < 354 msec(1/2) (2 standard deviations [SDs] below the mean in males), and among 5,473 females, 89 subjects (1.
63%) exhibited QTc < 364 msec(1/2) (2 SDs below the mean in females).
Only 3 subjects (0.
03% in all subjects and 0.
05% in males) exhibited QTc < 300 msec(1/2), however, none had clinical symptoms of short QT syndrome.
We chose patients with a short Bazett QTc interval from a database consisting of 114,334 patients to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of a short QT interval.
RESULTS: A total of 427 patients (mean age 43.
4 Β± 22.
4 years) had a short QT interval with about a 1.
2 times higher male predominance (234 men).
Of the 19,153 subjects, two met the criteria of short QT interval and allowed for prevalence and incidence estimates for short QT interval as 0.
01% and 0.
39/100,000 person-years, respectively.
The prevalence of QT interval <320 ms based on QTc, QTfc, and QTnc was 0.
10%, 0.
08%, and 0.
06%, and the prevalence of QT interval <340 ms was 0.
4%, 0.
3%, and 0.
3%, respectively.
