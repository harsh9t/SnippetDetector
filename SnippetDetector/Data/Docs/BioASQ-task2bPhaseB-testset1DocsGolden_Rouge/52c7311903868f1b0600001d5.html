Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene.
(PMID: 23378035) The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes.
(PMID: 21403557) The associated of FGFR3 mutations with craniosynostosis has been restricted to three mutations, the common p.
Pro250Arg in Muenke syndrome, p.
Ala391Glu in Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, and p.
Pro250Leu identified in a family with isolated craniosynostosis.
