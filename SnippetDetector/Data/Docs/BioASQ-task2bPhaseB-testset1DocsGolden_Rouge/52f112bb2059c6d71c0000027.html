The RNMT-activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein), is also recruited to transcription initiation sites via an interaction with RNMT.
We recently discovered that the mammalian cap methyltransferase is a heterodimer consisting of RNMT and the RNMT-activating subunit RAM (RNMT-activating mini-protein).
RAM activates and stabilizes RNMT and thus is critical for cellular cap methylation and cell viability.

The methylation of the 5' terminal guanosine residue of the cap structure of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mRNAs has been shown to occur in vitro concomitantly with their synthesis (R.

An RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase that specifically methylates the 5'-terminal guanosine residue of RNAs ending in the dinucleoside triphosphate G(5')pppN- has been purified from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells.
In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95).
