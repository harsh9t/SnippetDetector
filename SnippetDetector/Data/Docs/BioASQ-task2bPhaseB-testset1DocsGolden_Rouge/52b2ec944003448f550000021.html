In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways.
We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process.
