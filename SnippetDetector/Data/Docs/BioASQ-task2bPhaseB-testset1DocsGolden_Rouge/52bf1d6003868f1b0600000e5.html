Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three clinical subtypes (PMID: 16740155) Type 1 "classic" Pfeiffer syndrome involves individuals with mild manifestations including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia and finger and toe abnormalities; it is associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome.
Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications.
Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without a cloverleaf skull.
(PMID: 16740155) Type 1 represents the less severe cases, while types 2 and 3 are the more severe cases.
(PMID: 9475589) Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I.
Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows.
Such patients do poorly with an early death.
All reported instances to date have been sporadic.
Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull.
(PMID: 8434615) type I (PMID: 19407629) type II (PMID: 19407629) type III (PMID: 19407629).
