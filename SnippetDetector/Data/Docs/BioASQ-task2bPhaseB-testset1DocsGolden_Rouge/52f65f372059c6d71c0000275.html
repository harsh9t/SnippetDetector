Thyroid hormone is well known for its profound direct effects on cardiovascular function and metabolism.
The lipid-lowering actions of TH are mediated by the TH receptor - whereas the mechanisms explaining the BP variations concomitant with the thyroid disorders are less understood.
Here, we describe a previously unknown population of parvalbuminergic neurons in the anterior hypothalamus that requires thyroid hormone receptor signaling for proper development.
Recent evidence suggests that the hormone also regulates these systems indirectly through the central nervous system.
Furthermore, the findings may be beneficial for treatment of the recently identified patients that have a mutation in thyroid hormone receptor 1.
BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones exert multiple biological roles including effects on the cardiovascular system ( lipid profile, blood pressure ( BP ) and cardiac output ).
As the TH receptor - has been associated with many of TH actions on the cardiovascular system in mice models, we hypothesized that it could be involved in the latter.
While some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the hormone's central control of metabolism have been identified, its actions in the central cardiovascular control have remained enigmatic.
We thus tested whether polymorphisms in TR - could be associated with BP level variation.
