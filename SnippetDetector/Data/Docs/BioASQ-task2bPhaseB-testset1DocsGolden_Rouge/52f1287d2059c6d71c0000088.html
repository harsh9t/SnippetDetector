One example for antisense regulation is the Xist and Tsix gene pair, which is pivotal in X-inactivation.
Counting depends on the X inactivation center, which contains the Xist gene encoding a nuclear RNA, which coats the inactive X chromosome and induces gene silencing.
In the mouse placenta, where X inactivation is imprinted, the maternal Xist allele is repressed by a cis-acting antisense transcript, encoded by the Tsix gene.
Therefore, the repression of Xist by mouse Tsix has no counterpart in humans, and TSIX is not the gene that protects the active X chromosome from random inactivation.
Transcriptional silencing of the human inactive X chromosome is induced by the XIST gene within the human X-inactivation center.
A 37-kb sequence lying 3 ' to the Xist gene is known to prevent initiation of XCI in male differentiating ES cells.
We have also shown that in voles and rat the region homologous to the mouse Tsix major promoter, initiates antisense to Xist transcription and terminates around the Xist gene start site as is observed with mouse Tsix.
A conservation of Tsix expression pattern in voles, rat and mice suggests a crucial role of the antisense transcription in regulation of Xist and XIC in rodents.
