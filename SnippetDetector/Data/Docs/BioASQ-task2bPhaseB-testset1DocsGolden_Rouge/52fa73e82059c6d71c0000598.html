Here, we describe a vector system for efficient multigene assembly and transformation.
By exploiting the CreloxP recombination system and homing endonucleases, multiple rounds of gene assembly cycling were carried out with alternate use of the donor vectors, and multiple genes were sequentially delivered into the TAC vector.
Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes.
Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli.
The system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC)-based acceptor vector together with two donor vectors.
To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes.
However, these methods suffer from many disadvantages especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene silencing.
