Nalmefene (trade name Selincro), originally known as nalmetrene, is an opioid receptor antagonist developed in the early 1970s, and used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence, and also has been investigated for the treatment of other addictions such as pathological gambling and addiction to shopping.
(Wikipedia) Naltrexone- and to a lesser extent nalmefene- is an agent that modulates opioidergic transmission in the CNS and it shows a limited but well-studied efficacy in treating alcohol dependence.
(PMID: 21651459) Several derivatives of Naltrexone, Nalmefene (Nal) and JKB-119, exert immunomodulatory activity; however, unlike Nal, JKB-119 does not show significant opioid receptor antagonism.
(PMID: 21291870) The neurobiological mechanism by which opioid modulators affect drinking behavior is based on the strong connection between the endogenous opioid system, the dopamine system and the influence of the CNS stress response.
(PMID: 21651459) Opioids that stimulate the m-opioid receptor (MOR1) are the most frequently prescribed and effective analgesics.
Post hoc testing revealed this compound to be nalmefene, a potent clinically used antagonist, thus further validating the model.
