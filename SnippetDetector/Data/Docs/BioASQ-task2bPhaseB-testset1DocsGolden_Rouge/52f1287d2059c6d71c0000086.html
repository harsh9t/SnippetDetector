One of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells is subject to inactivation (XCI) initiated by the Xist gene.
(PMID: 21826206) One example for antisense regulation is the Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) and Tsix gene pair, which is pivotal in X-inactivation.
Xist works as a functional RNA molecule that recruits repressive chromatin factors towards one of the female Xs for inactivation.
Antisense Tsix transcription negatively regulates Xist and protects one X-chromosome in cis from inactivation by Xist.
Albeit, the precise molecular mechanism is still obscure it has been shown that Tsix transcription regulates the chromatin structure by altering histone tail modifications and DNA methylation at the Xist promoter.
In addition, Xist and Tsix RNA form an RNA duplexes in vivo and are processed to small RNAs, which have a potential regulatory function.
(PMID: 19013827) In eutherian mammals, random XCI of the soma requires a master regulatory locus known as the 'X-inactivation center' (XIC/Xic), wherein lies the noncoding XIST/Xist silencer RNA and its regulatory antisense Tsix gene.
