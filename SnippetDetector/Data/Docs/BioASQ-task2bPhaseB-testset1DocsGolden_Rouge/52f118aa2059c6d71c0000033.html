Human cells can process DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by either homology directed or non-homologous repair pathways.
Defects in components of DSB repair pathways are associated with a predisposition to cancer.
The products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which normally confer protection against breast cancer, are involved in homology-directed DSB repair.
PALB2 interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2 in supercomplexes involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination.
Heterozygous germline mutations in PALB2 confer a moderate risk of breast cancer, while biallelic PALB2 mutations are linked to a severe form of Fanconi anaemia characterized by early childhood solid tumours and severe chromosomal instability.
Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.
Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer.
The specific DNA repair systems for which there are data regarding the impact of repair defects on stem cell function include O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, non-homologous DNA end-joining Fanconi s anemia protein complex, and homologous recombination.
It has recently become clear that deficiencies of these processes are associated not only with cancer and/or aging but also with stem cell defects.
