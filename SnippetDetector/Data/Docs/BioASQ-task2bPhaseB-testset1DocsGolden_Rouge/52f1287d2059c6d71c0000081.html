Transcriptional silencing of the human inactive X chromosome is induced by the XIST gene within the human X-inactivation center.
The XIST allele must be turned off on one X chromosome to maintain its activity in cells of both sexes.
In the mouse placenta, where X inactivation is imprinted (the paternal X chromosome is always inactive), the maternal Xist allele is repressed by a cis-acting antisense transcript, encoded by the Tsix gene.
