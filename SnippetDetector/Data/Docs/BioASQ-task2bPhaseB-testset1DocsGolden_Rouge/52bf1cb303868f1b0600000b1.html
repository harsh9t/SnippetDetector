The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome.
Five patients, ranging from Upton type 1 to type 3 Apert hand deformities, have had preoperative computed tomography angiography that delineated the vascular anatomy.
This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients.
In patients with Apert syndrome, the hands demonstrate many disturbances of soft tissue and bony structures.
These include a short thumb with radial clinodactyly, complex syndactyly with a bony fusion involving the index, long and ring fingers, symphalangism and simple syndactyly of the fourth web space.
The soft tissue anomalies involve the intrinsic muscles, the extrinsic tendon insertions and the neurovascular bundles.
Two of the patients had Apert syndrome (syndromic craniosynostosis with symmetrical syndactyly) and two had polydactyly.
