Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene are present in lung adenocarcinomas that respond to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib.
responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for EGFR gene mutations that confer resistance to ATP competitive EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib.
Patients with somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene have dramatic response initially, but would eventually develop resistance to these TKIs.
EGFR gene mutations, exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutations are good predictors of response to EGFR-TKI treatment.
Responses to TK inhibitors in the absence of EGFR gene mutation for BAC patients have not been reported.
there has been no study in which cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of gefitinib and erlotinib are directly compared.
OBJECTIVE: Several cases have been reported in which central nervous system metastases of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) resistant to gefitinib were improved by erlotinib.
We examined the sensitivity of 23 NSCLC lines with wild-type or mutated EGFR to gefitinib to determine genes/proteins related to sensitivity, including EGFR and HER2 cell surface expression, phosphorylated EGFR expression, EGFR gene copy number, and EGFR mutational status.
