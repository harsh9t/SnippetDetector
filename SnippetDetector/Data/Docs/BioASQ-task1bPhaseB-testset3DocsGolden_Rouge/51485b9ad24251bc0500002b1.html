We evaluated the prognostic value of the 70-gene MammaPrint profile in Japanese women with node-negative breast cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The clinical and economic data for the two currently available gene-expression assays are reviewed.
The 70-gene signature is a prognostic tool used to guide adjuvant treatment decisions.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the 70-gene prognosis signature for early events in postmenopausal patients.
The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the proposed uses of the tests.
Adjuvant therapy is indicated on the assumption of residual micrometastatic disease.
BACKGROUND: The majority of breast cancer patients are postmenopausal women who are increasingly being offered adjuvant chemotherapy.
The evidence was inadequate to characterize the clinical validity of the Quest H: I Test.
Recommendation of systemic adjuvant therapy and choice of optimal agents for early-stage breast cancer remains a challenge.
We obtained the 70-gene profile of stage II-III patients prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and classified the prognosis-signatures.
UNASSIGNED: The EGAPP Working Group found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of tumor gene expression profiles to improve outcomes in defined populations of women with breast cancer.
