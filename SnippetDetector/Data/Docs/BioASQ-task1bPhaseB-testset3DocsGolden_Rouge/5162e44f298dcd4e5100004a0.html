The protein neprilysin can be deliverered to the brain (crossing the blood brain barrier) through: gene tranfer, transgenesis, gene induction, ex-vivo gene therapy, intracardiac (peripheral) administration of viral neprilysin construct, syringe-focused ultrasound device, convection-enhanced delivery and the use of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells that secrete functional neprilysin-bound exosomes.
