Recently, recommendations for the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen receptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
Oncotype DX has been available commercially since January 2004 and has been used for more than 85,000 patients.
The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score is a validated genomic predictor of outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer.
The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond to chemotherapy.
Also, the latest research into the benefit of the Oncotype DX assay in node-positive patients is discussed.
Patients with high risk of disease recurrence can also get an estimate of the magnitude of benefit to be gained by adding chemotherapy to surgery and hormonal therapy.
A retrospective chart review of 58 T1/T2, node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer patients that underwent Oncotype DX gene assay testing between January and December 2006 was performed.
positive breast cancer has been a conflicting issue.
