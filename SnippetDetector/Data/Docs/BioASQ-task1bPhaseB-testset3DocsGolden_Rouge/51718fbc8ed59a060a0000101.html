Several classes of deregulated miRNAs have also been shown to be differentially expressed in breast cancer, compared with healthy breast tissue (Volinia et al.
, 2006).
It is now recognized that miRNA also have a primary role in cancer onset and progression.
Moreover, the expression signatures of informative miRNA subsets have enabled better molecular classification than mRNA expression profiles in several types of human cancer (Lu et al.
, 2005).
Several studies have shown that unique miRNA expression profiles are present in lots of cancers, such as breast, lung, oesophageal, prostate and pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer, suggesting that miRNAs may act as oncogenes or cancer suppressors [4].
In humans, 50% of the miRNA genes are located at genomic sites associated with cancer-specific chromosomal rearrangements.
Such miRNAs were initially linked to tumorigenesis due to their proximity to chromosomal breakpoints (Calin et al.
, 2004b) and their dysregulated expression levels in many malignancies (Calin et al.
, 2004a).
As an anti-apoptosis factor, aberrantly expressed miR-21 compromises tumor suppressor-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells [6,7].
