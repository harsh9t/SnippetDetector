The thyroid hormone (TH) induced regulation of  SERCA is mediated both by non-genomic and genomic actions.
Genomic actions are mediated by the binding of T(3) receptors (TRs) to the thyroid response elements in the SERCA promotor and result in increased gene expression.
Thyroid hormone  increases the transcription of  SERCA 2  through three thyroid hormone response elements.
Data show that the regulation of  cardiac SERCA by thyroid hormone is made at the  pretranslational and possibly transcriptional level 
TRΞ²1 is shown to be coupled to the expression of SERCA in the heart
An  increase of TR expression in the hypertrophied heart has been show to result in  increased SERCA expression.
Inhibition of TRΞ±1 by dronedarone does not change the expression of SERCA in the heart
Findings show that  SERCA 2 gene expression  is regulated  by TR  isoform-specific interactions with transcription factor (MEF-2) 
Hypothyroidism is accompanied by decreased expression of SERCA in the heart.
T3 increases expression of the cardiac SERCA
TH treatment can reverse the reduction in the ratio of SERCA to phospholamban expression which is found in postinfarcted hearts
TH treatment  results in increased expression of SERCA in hearts from banded rats.
