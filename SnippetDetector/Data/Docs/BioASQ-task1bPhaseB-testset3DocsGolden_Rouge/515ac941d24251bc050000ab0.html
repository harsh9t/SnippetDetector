T4 increases myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis.
The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.
T3 induces mitochondrial biogenesis.
In fact, T3 treatment for 72h  increases activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.
g.
COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.
g.
PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha).
Furthermore, L-T3 increases  the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1Ξ±, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Ξ³ coactivator-1Ξ±, in the LV peri-infarct zone.
The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis by T3.
Truncated forms of the nuclear receptor TRΞ±1, with molecular weights of 43 kDa (p43) and 28 Kda have been previously identified in mitochondria.
P43 is a mitochondrial T3 receptor which stimulates mitochondrial transcription and protein synthesis in the presence of T3.
p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity.
