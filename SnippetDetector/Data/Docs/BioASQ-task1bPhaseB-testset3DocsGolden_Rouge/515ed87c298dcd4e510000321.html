BACKGROUND: Data from human epidemiological studies, cultured mammalian cells, and animal models have supported a potentially beneficial role of selenium in prostate cancer prevention.
These results demonstrate that selenoproteins and selenium metabolism are regulated at multiple levels in prostate cells.
We investigated the relationship of these SNPs with prostate cancer risk.
Selenium may affect prostate cancer risk via its plasma carrier selenoprotein P which shows dramatically reduced expression in prostate cancer tumors and cell lines.
Its purpose was to assess the role of selenium and vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention, but SELECT found no decline in prostate cancer.
Selenium supplementation in a population with low basal blood selenium levels has been reported to decrease the incidence of several cancers including prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and a leading cause of cancer death.
A recently discovered selenoprotein, SEP15, which is highly expressed in the prostate, may play a role either independently or by modifying the effects of selenium.
We evaluated the association between serum selenium status and prostate cancer risk in a population with relative low selenium concentrations considering effect modification by genetic variants in selenoprotein genes.
