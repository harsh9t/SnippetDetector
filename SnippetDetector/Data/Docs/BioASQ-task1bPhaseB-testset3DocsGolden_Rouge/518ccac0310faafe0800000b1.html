Light activities (<4 multiples of resting metabolic rate (METs)) were not associated with reduced mortality rates, moderate activities (4-<6 METs) appeared somewhat beneficial, and vigorous activities (> or =6 METs) clearly predicted lower mortality rates (p, trend = 0.
72, 0.
07, and <0.
001, respectively).
This long-term study of joggers showed that jogging was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality and a substantial increase in survival for both men and women.
He purpose of this study was to investigate if jogging, which can be very vigorous, is associated with increased all-cause mortality in men and women.
Death rates declined with increased levels of total activity (estimated in kilocalories), and declined also with increased intensity of effort measured as from none, to light, to moderately vigorous or vigorous sports play.
Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners.
Death rates at any given quantity of physical exercise were lower for men playing moderately intense sports than for less vigorous men.
