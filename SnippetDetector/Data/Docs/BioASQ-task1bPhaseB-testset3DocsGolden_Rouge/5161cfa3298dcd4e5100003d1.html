It is possible that the identified germline variants modulate predisposition to CRC.
Many individuals with multiple or large colorectal adenomas or early-onset colorectal cancer have no detectable germline mutations in the known cancer predisposition genes.
These variants are established to be associated with adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer.
To uncover pathogenic deep intronic variants in patients with colorectal adenomatous polyposis, in whom no germline mutation in the APC or MUTYH genes can be identified by routine diagnostics, we performed a systematic APC messenger RNA analysis in 125 unrelated mutation-negative cases.
Beside germline mutations in the APC and MUTYH genes, only four cases of mosaic APC mutations have been reported.
It is estimated that up to 35 % of colorectal cancers can be explained by hereditary factors.
Some of the APC negative FAP and AFAP cases have recently been found to be attributable to MYH associated polyposis.
MAP is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with 5-100 colorectal adenomas and caused by mutation in the MYH gene.
We investigated germline polymorphisms in genes involved in VEGF-dependent and - independent angiogenesis pathways to predict clinical outcome and tumor response in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
