These two miRNAs could be useful in the diagnosis of CHF patients, and might provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of CHF.
He miRNAs miR-126 and miR-508-5p are associated with the outcome of ICM and NICM patients with CHF.
In 10 patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of miR-126 were up-regulated with improvement of the NYHA class from IV to III.
The plasma concentration of miR-126 was negatively correlated with age and NYHA class, and could be a useful biomarker for heart failure.
