Depending on the tissue or cell where ILK is ablated we see different effects:
Ablation of ILK in heart results in dilated cardiomyopathy and spontaneous heart failure
Ablation of ILK in fibroblasts leads to impaired healing due to a severe reduction in the number of myofibroblasts
Ablation of ILK in osteoclasts inhibits bone resorption
Ablation of ILK in liver results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration and in abnormal histology
Ablation of ILK in podocytes caused an aberrant distribution of nephrin and alpha-actinin-4.
