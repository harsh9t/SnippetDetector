The knockdown of km23-1 results in numerous effects at the cellular level, such as decreased cell migration.
Additionaly, km23-1 is involved in signalling pathways and its knockdown results in decreased RhoA activation, inhibition of TGFΞ²-mediated activation of ERK and JNK, phosphorylation of c-Jun, transactivation of the c-Jun promoter and decreased TGFbeta responses.
