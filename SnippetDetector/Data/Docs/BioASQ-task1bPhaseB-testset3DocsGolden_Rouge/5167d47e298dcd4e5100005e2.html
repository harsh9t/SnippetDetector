Recently emerging diagnostic tools such as MammaPrint and oncotype-DX are beginning to have impact on clinical practice of breast cancer.
Oncotype DX, PAM50, and MammaPrint are multigene tests that are being used clinically for early-stage breast cancer to predict recurrence risk and guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions.
Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel.
The development of the genomic signatures for each trial -- Oncotype DX and MammaPrint -- has followed quite different routes.
Background: Advances in the treatment of breast cancer have led to a reduction in breast-cancer-related mortality.
With the increasingly early diagnosis of breast cancer and the advent of breast tumor subtyping, the need for determining which patients need adjuvant therapy has become more pressing and more complex.
PANEL STATEMENTS: The majority of the working group members found the available evidence on the analytical and clinical validity of Oncotype Dx and MammaPrint to be convincing.
In recent years, molecular research has translated into remarkable changes of breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.
molecular signature of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their prognostic value in breast cancer patients remain elusive.
