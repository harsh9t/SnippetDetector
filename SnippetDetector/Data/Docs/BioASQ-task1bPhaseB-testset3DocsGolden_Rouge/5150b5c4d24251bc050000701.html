Drug costs after patent expiry are an area of particular interest because the substitution of branded medication with generics represents an opportunity for lowering drug costs.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether switching from brand name ramipril to a generic product after patent expiry may negatively affect patients' refill compliance.
In addition, the relative market shares of the different trade channels were compared before and after patent expiry.
drug costs may not decrease after patent expiry, because of a lack of price competition and different national pricing systems.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the trends in the use of generics after patent expiry for enalapril, fluoxetine and ranitidine and the subsequent changes, if any, in the costs of these medications.
BACKGROUND: In order to increase price competition, government regulations focus on controlling drug costs.
RESULTS: The costs per DDD decreased for all three drugs and, as expected, these costs decrease more rapidly after patent expiry.
Patients were included if they had filled a ramipril prescription for either brand name or generic ramipril products between September 2003 and June 2004.
Significant differences in the trend lines were found for enalapril and fluoxetine.
