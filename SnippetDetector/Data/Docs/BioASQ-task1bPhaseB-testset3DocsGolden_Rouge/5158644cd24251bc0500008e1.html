No significant effect of exercise was observed on postprandial levels of ghrelin.
Exercise significantly increased mean PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels, and this effect was maintained during the post-exercise period for GLP-1 and PP.
Following the pre-exercise meal, ghrelin was suppressed ~17% and insulin and PYY were elevated ~157 and ~40%, respectively, relative to fasting (day 7).
Peptide YY increased during exercise but most consistently during END (PΒ <Β 0.
05).
Increases in blood PYY(3-36) levels were dependent on the exercise intensity (effect of session: P<0.
001 by two-way ANOVA), whereas those in GLP-1 levels were similar between two different exercise sessions.
'exercise-induced anorexia' may potentially be linked to increased PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels.
Following exercise, PYY, ghrelin, and GH were significantly (p < 0.
0001) increased by ~11, ~16 and ~813%, respectively.
Significant (P < 0.
05) interaction effects for hunger, acylated ghrelin, and PYY, indicating suppressed hunger and acylated ghrelin during aerobic and resistance exercise and increased PYY during aerobic exercise.
