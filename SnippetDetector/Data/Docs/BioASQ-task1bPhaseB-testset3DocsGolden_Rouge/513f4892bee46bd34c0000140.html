T3-induced cardiac sprouting angiogenesis in adult hypothyroid mice was associated with PDGF-BB, PDGFR-Ξ² and downstream activation of Akt.
T(3) administration restored TRbeta mRNA expression level in AAC hearts to the control level.
TRbeta in the coronary ECs regulates capillary density during cardiac development, and down-regulation of TRbeta results in coronary microvascular rarefaction during pathological hypertrophy.
