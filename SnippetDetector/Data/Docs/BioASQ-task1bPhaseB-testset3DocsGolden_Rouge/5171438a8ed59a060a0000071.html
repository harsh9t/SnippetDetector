BACKGROUND: RET germline mutations predispose to the development of inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.
To describe the coexistence of mutations of both the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and type 2 ( MEN2 ) genes in a large Italian family and evaluate if it could be associated with more aggressive clinical manifestations of the two syndromes.
Activating germline RET mutations are presented in patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) types 2A and 2B, whereas inactivating germline mutations in patients with Hirschsprung's disease ( HSCR ).
The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene.
This is the second report in literature of coexistence in the same family of germline mutations of both RET proto-oncogene and MEN1 gene.
We also speculate about the role of a silent mutation in exon 2 of this same gene, present in a homozygous state in the patient with both MEN2A and HSCR.
MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16.
The aim of this study was to characterize the RET mutational spectrum in MEN2 families and apparently sporadic MTC cases originating from the central region of Portugal.
