Gene expression profiling tests are used in an attempt to determine the right treatment for the right person with early-stage breast cancer that may have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant parts of the body.
Gene expression profiling (GEP) is being used increasingly for risk stratification to identify women with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, early stage breast cancer who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
Online.
The expected benefit from these models are that treatment recommendations for women with early-stage breast cancer will become more individualized and thereby appropriate by combining standard clinicopathologic and molecular features.
These new diagnostic approaches are designed to spare people who do not need additional treatment (adjuvant therapy) the side effects of unnecessary treatment, and allow people who may benefit from adjuvant therapy to receive it.
Conclusion: These techniques differ in their execution and application and have been demonstrated to provide further data on risk stratification as compared with conventional breast-cancer-risk factors.
